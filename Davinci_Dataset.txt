Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
Mathematical physics is a discipline at the interface of mathematics and physics, concerned with developing mathematical theories and models of physical phenomena and mathematical apparatus arising or needed in such models.
Mathematical physics intersects with theoretical physics which deals with theoretical arguments in consideration of physical phenomena and the development of models of known and of conjectured physics. Theoretical physics is commonly more widely conceived as it deals also with interpretations, non-rigorous and sometimes speculative argument from experiments or from rough comparisons of different models and various experimental data, not necessarily being mathematically satisfactoy.
For example, the calculations of fitting parameters and adjusting models to complicated experimental data, called phenomenology is part of the work of a theoretical physicist, but most such work is not nowadays considered to belong to mathematical physics, unless one is developing a really new mathematical model or tool for such work.
On the other hand, ever since Galilei 1623 (∼\sim “The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.”), Hilbert 1930 (“The instrument that mediates between theory and practice, between thought and observation, is mathematics.”) and Wigner 1959 (“unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences”) it may be understood that ultimately, when the dust has settled, all physics is mathematical physics (cf. theory of everything).
Historically, there has been some variance as to what exactly is comprised by “mathematical physics”, see (Fadeev 00) for some history.
In the beginning of the 20th century the term was understood very broadly:

Not only Henri Poincaré, but also Albert Einstein, were called mathematical physicists. Newly established theoretical chairs were called chairs of mathematical physics. It follows from the documents in the archives of the Nobel Committee that MP had a right to appear both in the nominations and discussion of the candidates for the Nobel Prize in physics. Roughly speaking, the concept of Mathematical Physics covered theoretical papers where mathematical formulae were used. (Fadeev 00, p. 1)

Also, in the list of Hilbert's problems of mathematics, the sixth problem regards the mathematical formulation of physics as one of the core problems in mathematics:

6. Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics. The investigations on the foundations of geometry suggest the problem: To treat in the same manner, by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important part; in the first rank are the theory of probabilities and mechanics.

However, the 1920 and 1930s the term “mathematical physics” began to be reserved more exclusively for the activity of making precise arguments that are already more or less understood by theoretical physicists informally. The term began to be referred to mathematical tools used in physics or yet more specifically in classical physics as the theory of partial differential equations and variational calculus and in quantum physics as functional analysis and representation theory.

One sees the quest for the rigorous mathematical theorems about results which are understood by physicists in their own way. (Fadeev 00, p. 2)

More recently this narrow understanding has been called into question: Fadeev 00, p. 3 writes:

I consider as the main goal of Mathematical Physics the use of mathematical intuition for the derivation of really new results in the fundamental physics. In this sense, Mathematical Physics and Theoretical Physics are competitors. Their goals in unraveling the laws of the structure of matter coincide. However, the methods and even the estimates of the importance of the results of work may differ quite significally.

In a similar spirit of trying to break out of an overly restrictive understanding of the term “mathematical physics” Gregory Moore has been advocating the alternative term physical mathematics for the study of mathematical constructions inspired by models of theoretical physics (Moore 14).
Some of the greatest names of mathematical physics have sought a more profound role for it in the belief that very deep mathematical ideas are required to describe nature. For instance, Paul Dirac expresses such a view here:

It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. (Paul Dirac, The Evolution of the Physicist’s Picture of Nature, Scientific American 1963)

This view led Dirac to advocate the following as a methodology:

The trend of mathematics and physics towards unification provides the physicist with a powerful new method of research into the foundations of his subject, a method which has not yet been applied successfully, but which I feel confident will prove its value in the future. The method is to begin by choosing that branch of mathematics which one thinks will form the basis of the new theory. One should be influenced very much in this choice by considerations of mathematical beauty. It would probably be a good thing also to give a preference to those branches of mathematics that have an interesting group of transformations underlying them, since transformations play an important role in modern physical theory, both relativity and quantum theory seeming to show that transformations are of more fundamental importance than equations. Having decided on the branch of mathematics, one should proceed to develop it along suitable lines, at the same time looking for that way in which it appears to lend itself naturally to physical interpretation. (The Relation between Mathematics and Physics)

Hermann Weyl helped develop many of the ingredients of modern mathematical physics, as Michael Atiyah explains:

The past 25 years have seen the rise of gauge theories–Kaluza-Klein models of high dimensions, string theories, and now M-theory, as physicists grapple with the challenge of combining all the basic forces of nature into one all embracing theory. This requires sophisticated mathematics involving Lie groups, manifolds, differential operators, all of which are part of Weyl’s inheritance. There is no doubt that he would have been an enthusiastic supporter and admirer of this fusion of mathematics and physics. No other mathematician could claim to have initiated more of the theories that are now being explored. His vision has stood the test of time. (Michael Atiyah, Hermann Weyl: 1885-1955)


[Weyls] contemporaries are long since gone and only a few personal reminiscences survive. On the other hand the passage of time makes it easier to assess the long-term significance of Weyl’s work, to see how his ideas have influenced his successors and helped to shape mathematics and physics in the second half of the twentieth century. In fact, the last fifty years have seen a remarkable blossoming of just those areas that Weyl initiated. In retrospect one might almost say that he defined the agenda and provided the proper framework for what followed. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, and he also took a serious interest in theoretical physics. (Michael Atiyah, Hermann Weyl: 1885-1955)

The version of this belief in the necessity of deep mathematics for physics to be found at the nnLab is, naturally enough, that higher categories, and in particular cohesive (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes, are required. In this regard, see higher category theory and physics, geometry of physics and differential cohomology in a cohesive topos.
The philosophy of physics.
We discuss the setting in which fundamental physics takes place.
Dynamics in space
Physics is dynamics in spaces .
Higher topos theory provides the formalizations of this most fundamental aspect of physics.


A general context for spaces is a big (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}.


A general context for geometrical spaces is a local (∞,1)-topos.


A general context for geometrical spaces and processes in these spaces is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


An example of relevance for much of physics is the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞LieGrpd of ∞-Lie groupoids. This contains


smooth manifolds;


orbifolds;


diffeological spaces;


smooth path spaces;


In its Cahiers topos-version it contains also


infinitesimal spaces;


such as ∞-Lie algebroids.


de Rham spaces, smooth D-modules;


In its full derived geometry-version it contains also

derived ∞-Lie algebroids such as the BV-BRST complexes of gauge theories.

Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos comes with its intrinsic notion of cohomology. This encodes kinematics in physics. Such as orientation; spin structures; string structures, fivebrane structures.
Every cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is in particular a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos. For these their intrinsic cohomology refines to differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos classifying connections on ∞-bundles. This encodes dynamics in physics: a connection on a principal ∞\infty-bundle is a gauge field which exerts forces. Such as:

the electromagnetic field, Yang-Mills field, the field of gravity, of supergravity, the Kalb-Ramond field, the supergravity C-field, the RR-field.

In every such connected (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos every characteristic class gives rise to its ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism that sends gauge fields encoded as ∞-connections on principal ∞-bundles to circle n-bundles with connection. Such as:

the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle known from the Green-Schwarz mechanism or the Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle known from dual heterotic string theory.

Under the higher parallel transport of these circle nn-bundles with connection, this assignment is the action functional for the ∞-Chern-Simons theory of the corresponding characteristic class. This includes as special cases various sigma-model quantum field theories such as:

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, ordinary Chern-Simons theory, all versions of AKSZ theory, (Chern-Simons-)supergravity, BF-theory coupled to topological Yang-Mills theory with cosmological constant.

These are all topological quantum field theories. But by the holographic principle of higher category theory we have that on their boundaries live non-topological theories:


on the boundary of Chern-Simons theory sits the Wess-Zumino-Witten model.


on the boundary of the A-model sits the quantum mechanics dynamics of any classical symplectic phase space and on the boundary of the Poisson sigma-model that of a Poisson manifold phase space.


Quantum dynamics
The quantum mechanics associated with such sigma-models is the collection of data given by


on each closed piece Σ d−n\Sigma_{d-n} of worldvolume cobordism of codimension nn the n-vector space of states of the system;


on each piece with boundary ∂Σ in→Σ←∂Σ out\partial \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \partial \Sigma_{out} a morphism between these nn-vector spaces encoding the propagation of states;


on each open subset U⊂ΣU \subset \Sigma the algebra of observables .


Two dual formalizations axiomatize this:


AQFT/factorization algebras: the assignment of algebras of observables is encoded in an (∞,n)-copresheaf of ∞-algebras on Σ\Sigma with suitable properties;


FQFT: the assignment of spaces of states and propagators is encoded in an (∞,n)-functor on the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms (see cobordism hypothesis).


Well-understood examples of such quantum field theories include


AQFT:


2-dimensional conformal field theory by conformal nets and vertex operator algebra


topological chiral homology




FQFT:


2-dimensional conformal field theory (see FFRS-formalism)


TCFTs ((∞,1)-category-formulations of 2d TQFT): the A-model, the B-model, their duality under homological mirror symmetry




Quantization
By the above there is a fairly well-developed formalization of


background gauge fields and their sigma-model action functional;


quantum field theories.


The idea is that the former induce examples of the latter by a process called quantization. This is imagined to be given by a path integral over the action functional.
This step in full generality is not yet well understood formally. For a list of literature addressing this problem see Literature on quantization.
But special aspects of quantization are quite well understood. See for instance


deformation quantization


geometric quantization, multisymplectic geometry


Hopf-algebraic renormalization


We look at some aspects of the above general abstract story in more detail.
Gauge theory
Introduction
The discovery of gauge theory is effectively the discovery of groupoids in fundamental physics. The notion of gauge transformation is close to synonymous to the notion isomorphism and more generally to equivalence in an (∞,1)-category .
From a modern point of view, the mathematical model for a gauge field in physics is a cocycle in (nonabelian) differential cohomology: a principal bundle with connection and its higher analogs. These naturally do not form just a set, but a groupoid and generally an ∞-groupoid, whose morphisms are gauge transformations, and higher morphisms are gauge-of-gauge transformations. The development of differential cohomology has to a fair extent been motivated by and influenced by its application to fundamental theoretical physics in general and gauge theory in particular.
Around 1850 Maxwell realized that the field strength of the electromagnetic field is modeled by what today we call a closed differential 2-form on spacetime. In the 1930s Dirac observed that more precisely this 2-form is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)-principal bundle with connection, hence that the electromagnetic field is modeled by what today is called a degree 2-cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology .
Meanwhile, in 1915, Einstein had identified also the field strength of the field of gravity as the 𝔰𝔬(d,1)\mathfrak{so}(d,1)-valued curvature 2-form of the canonical O(d,1)-principal bundle with connection on a d+1d+1-dimensional spacetime Lorentzian manifold. This is a cocycle in differential nonabelian cohomology: in Chern-Weil theory.
In the 1950s Yang-Mills theory identified the field strength of all the gauge fields in the standard model of particle physics as the 𝔲(n)\mathfrak{u}(n)-valued curvature 2-forms of U(n)-principal bundles with connection. This is again a cocycle in differential nonabelian cohomology.

Entities of ordinary gauge theory
Lie algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge Lie group GG – connection with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal bundle over a smooth manifold XX.

It is noteworthy that already in this mathematical formulation of experimentally well-confirmed fundamental physics the seed of higher differential cohomology is hidden: Dirac had not only identified the electromagnetic field as a line bundle with connection, but he also correctly identified (rephrased in modern language) its underlying cohomological Chern class with the (physically hypothetical but formally inevitable) magnetic charge located in spacetime. But in order to make sense of this, he had to resort to removing the support of the magnetic charge density from the spacetime manifold, because Maxwell’s equations imply that at the support of any magnetic charge the 2-form representing the field strength of the electromagnetic field is in fact not closed and hence in particular not the curvature 2-form of an ordinary connection on an ordinary bundle.
In (Freed) this old argument was improved by refining the model for the electromagnetic field one more step: Dan Freed notices that the charge current 3-form is itself to be regarded as a curvature, but for a connection on a circle 2-bundle with connection – also called a bundle gerbe – , which is a cocycle in degree 3 ordinary differential cohomology. Accordingly, the electromagnetic field is fundamentally not quite a line bundle, but a twisted bundle with connection, with the twist being the magnetic charge 3-cocycle. Freed shows that this perspective is inevitable for understanding the quantum anomaly of the action functional for electromagnetism is the presence of magnetic charge.
In summary, the experimentally verified models, to date, of fundamental physics are based on the notion of (twisted) U(n)U(n)-principal bundles with connection for the Yang-Mills field and O(d,1)O(d,1)-principal bundles with connection for the description of gravity, hence on nonabelian differential cohomology in degree 2 (possibly with a degree-3 twist).
In attempts to better understand the structure of these two theories and their interrelation, theoretical physicists were led to consider variations and generalizations of them that are known as supergravity and string theory. In these theories the notion of gauge field turns out to generalize: instead of just Lie algebras, Lie groups and connections with values in these, one finds structures called Lie 2-algebras, Lie 2-groups and the gauge fields themselves behave like generalized connections with values in these.

Entities of 2-gauge theory
Lie 2-algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge Lie 2-group GG – connection on a 2-bundle with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal 2-bundle/gerbe over an orbifold XX.

Notably the string is charged under a field called the Kalb-Ramond field or BB-field which is modeled by a BU(1)\mathbf{B}U(1)-principal 2-bundle with connection, where BU(1)\mathbf{B}U(1) is the Lie 2-group delooping of the circle group: the circle Lie 2-group. Its Lie 2-algebra B𝔲(1)\mathbf{B}\mathfrak{u}(1) is given by the differential crossed module [𝔲(1)→0][\mathfrak{u}(1) \to 0] which has 𝔲(1)\mathfrak{u}(1) shifted up by one in homological degree.
So far all these differential cocycles were known and understood mostly as concrete constructs, without making their abstract home in differential cohomology explicit. It is the next gauge field that made Freed and Hopkins propose (FreedHopkins, Freed) that the theory of differential cohomology is generally the formalism that models gauge fields in physics:
The superstring is charged also under what is called the RR-field, a gauge field modeled by cocycles in differential K-theory. In even degrees we may think of this as a differential cocycle whose curvature form has coefficients in the ∞-Lie algebra ⊕ n=0 ∞B 2n𝔲(1)\oplus_{n=0}^\infty \mathbf{B}^{2 n} \mathfrak{u}(1). Here b 2n𝔲(1)b^{2n} \mathfrak{u}(1) is the abelian 2n-Lie algebra whose underlying complex is concentrated in degree 2n2 n on ℝ\mathbb{R}.
So fully generally, one finds ∞-Lie algebras, ∞-Lie groups and gauge fields behaving like connections with values in these.

Entities of general gauge theory
∞-Lie algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge ∞-Lie group GG – connection on an ∞-bundle with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal ∞-bundle over an ∞-Lie groupoid XX.

The curvature characteristic forms / Chern characters in the abelian formulation of differential cohomology take values in abelian ∞-Lie algebras and are therefore effectively nothing but differential forms with values in a complex of vector spaces, but more generally in ∞-Chern-Weil theory on nonabelian principal ∞-bundles, the curvatures forms themselves take values in general ∞-Lie algebras, such as the string Lie 2-algebra, the supergravity Lie 3-algebra and the fivebrane Lie 6-algebra.
Apart from generalizing the notion of gauge Lie groups to Lie 2-groups and further, structural considerations in fundamental physics also led theoretical physicists to consider models for spacetime that are more general than than the notion of a smooth manifold. In string theory spacetime is allowed to be more generally an orbifold or a generalization thereof, such as an orientifold. The natural mathematical model for these generalized spaces are Lie groupoids or, essentially equivalently, differentiable stacks .
It is noteworthy that the notions of generalized gauge groups and the generalized spacetime models encountered this way have a natural common context: all of these are examples of smooth ∞-groupoids.
There is a natural mathematical concept that serves to describe contexts of such generalized spaces: a gros (∞,1)-topos. The notion of differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos provides a unifying perspective on the mathematical structure encoding the generalized gauge fields and generalized spacetime models encountered in modern theoretical physics in such a general context.
Classes of examples
We discuss classes of examples of gauge theories that have been considered. For all of these the configuration space is a space of connections on ∞-bundles {∇}\{\nabla\} over spacetime XX of sorts, which one might take to be the defining property of a gauge theory. But there are different types of action functionals on these configuration spaces.
Generalized Yang-Mills theory
In Yang-Mills theory the action functional is of the form
∇↦∫ X⟨F ∇∧⋆F ∇⟩,
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla \rangle
  \,,


where


F ∇F_\nabla is the curvature differential form,


“⋆\star” the Hodge star operator with respect to a fixed (pseudo-)Riemannian metric-structure on XX


and ⟨−⟩\langle -\rangle some invariant polynomial.


This is the original notion of gauge theory and might be taken to be the strict sense of the term.


For gauge group G=U(1)G = U(1) the circle group this is electromagnetism;


For gauge group a general nonabelian Lie group GG this is Yang-Mills theory proper.


Specifically for GG a discrete quotient of SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) this is the gauge-field part of the standard model of particle physics.


For structure group G=BU(1)G = \mathbf{B}U(1) the circle 2-group this yields the Kalb-Ramond field


For structure group G=B 2U(1)G = \mathbf{B}^2U(1) the circle 3-group this yields the supergravity C-field.


For structure group the K-theory spectrum we get differential K-theory describing the RR-field.


A nonabelian cohomology version of higher Yang-Mills theory – replacing a connection on a bundle by a connection on a 2-bundle is expected to control certain 6-dimensional theories that compactify to ordinary Yang-Mills on the torus and thereby explain S-duality . See there for more details on this.
∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory
In ∞-Chern-Simons theory the action functional is of the form
∇↦∫ XCS(∇),
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X CS(\nabla)
  \,,



where CS(−)CS(-) is a Chern-Simons element for an invariant polynomial ⟨−⟩\langle - \rangle on an ∞-Lie algebroid 𝔞\mathfrak{a}.

This includes ordinary Chern-Simons theory in the case that 𝔞\mathfrak{a} is a semisimple Lie algebra, but for general 𝔞\mathfrak{a} it subsumes a wide variety of types of TQFTs that are often counted as of different type than Chern-Simons theory, such as BF-theory and AKSZ theory.
The action functional of ∞-Chern-Simons theory stands out by the fact that it arises by general abstract construction:


the underlying Lagrangian CS(∇)CS(\nabla) is nothing but the ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism
CS(−):BG diff→B nU(1) diff 
  CS(-) : \mathbf{B}G_{diff} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{diff}


induced by the given invariant polynomial ⟨−⟩\langle - \rangle. This sends gauge fields in the form of GG-valued connections on ∞-bundles to the circle n-bundle with connection whose higher parallel transport is given by the Lagrangian;


the integral over CS(∇)CS(\nabla) is induced by postcomposition with the trunction morphism
H(Σ,BG conn)→CS(−)H(Σ,B nU(1) diff)≃∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))→∫ Στ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))≃B n−dimΣU(1).
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}) 
    \stackrel{CS(-)}{\to} 
   \mathbf{H}(\Sigma,\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{diff}) 
   \simeq 
   \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), B^n U(1)) 
  \stackrel{\int_\Sigma}{\to} 
    \tau_{n-dim \Sigma}
    \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), B^n U(1)) \simeq B^{n-dim \Sigma} U(1) 
  \,.



For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a semisimple Lie algebra equipped with its Killing form invariant polynomial we have that CS(−)CS(-) is the ordinary Chern-Simons element and ∫ XCS(∇)\int_X CS(\nabla) the ordinary Chern-Simons theory action functional. This may be understood as the higher parallel transport of a Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle with connection.


For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a semisimple Lie algebra equipped with its degree 8 invariant polynomial this yields 7-dimensional, whose action functional may be understood as the higher parallel transport of a Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle with connection.


For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a symplectic Lie n-algebroid equipped with its canonical invariant polynomial ω\omega of degree n+2n+2 ∫ XCS ω(−)\int_X CS_\omega(-) is the actional functional of AKSZ theory:


for n=1n = 1 this is the Poisson sigma-model;


for n=2n = 2 this is the Courant sigma-model.




For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a Lie 2-algebra equipped with the Killing form invariant polynomial, ∫ XCS(−)\int_X CS(-) is the action functional of BF-theory coupled to topological Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant.


Gravity
The configuration spaces of gravity and supergravity may be identified with spaces of connections on ∞-bundles with gauge group a variant of the Poincare group. This parameterization of the configuration space of gravity is known as the first order formulation of gravity, to be contrasted with a formulation explicitly over a space of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.


The special orthogonal group SOS O-component of the connection in this case is called the spin connection;


the translation group-component of ∇\nabla is called the vielbein.


For the ordinary Poincare group this yields the Palatini action expression for the standard Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity.
In contrast to the ∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory discussed above, the general abstract nature, if any, of the action functional for gravity remains somewhat inconclusive and subject of a plethora of speculations. If one passes from connections to their associated Dirac operators and interprets these as parts of a spectral triple there is the spectral action functional on the space of spectral triples. This we discuss in more detail below.
There are various higher group extensions of the Poincare group and the orthonormal group that lead accordingly to higher order variations of gravity.


lifting SOS O-connections through the smooth Whitehead tower
⋯→Fivebrane→String→Spin→SO→O

spin structures and spin group-principal bundles with connection.
This lift is necessary to cancel the quantum anomaly of spinning particles coupled to gravity;

This lift is necessary to cancel the quantum anomaly of heterotic superstrings;

Phenomenological models: the standard model and gravity
Theoretical physics consists of two parts: theory and models, laws and initial conditions, axioms and phenomenology.
For instance the theory called general relativity describes the classical dynamics of gravity, but does not predict the value of the cosmological constant. Rather, for each choice of the latter does the theory predict a certain dynamics the large-scale universe.
The theory that describes the fundamental forces and particles except gravity is Yang-Mills theory. This, too, does not predict the fundamental particle species seen in experiments, but for a correct choice and identification of these, the theory does predict the dynamics of these particles, as observed in accelerators.
The total collection of these choices of fundamental particles that are observed in experiments is called the standard model of particle physics. It consists basically of


a choice of gauge group GG, such that all observed gauge fields are components of a connection on a GG-principal bundle;


a choice of linear representation ρ\rho of GG, such that all observed fermion fields are components of sections of a ρ\rho-associated bundle.


What precisely the “standard” model of particle physics is changes slightly over time, as new experimental insights are gained. Its particles were added item-by-item as they were discovered. More recently the mass of the particles called neutrinos, which was originally thought to be precisely 0, was measured to be very small, but non-vanishing.
The standard model as far as understood today exhibits a curious mixture of pattern and irregularity. This seems to suggest that it ought to have a more fundamental description in terms of a conceptually simpler structure out of which these patterns with their irregularities emerge. Since also the force of gravity is not presently included in the quantization of the standard model, it may seem plausible that this underlying structure is related to quantum gravity.
We discuss in the following some of the proposals that have been suggested for how to formalize this situation.
Spectral standard model and gravity
A fundamental relativistic particle is technically a 1-dimensional sigma-model QFT on 1-dimensional cobordisms with target the spacetime XX that it propagates in. Since both gravity as well as Yang-Mills fields are encoded in connections it is plausible to assume that the only background field on XX that the particle couples to is a connection ∇ ρ\nabla_\rho on a ρ\rho-associated bundle over a GG-principal bundle.
Here


roughly every semisimple Lie algebra summand in 𝔤=Lie(G)\mathfrak{g} = Lie(G) is one gauge field – a bosonic field;


every irreducible representation that ρ\rho decomposes into is one matter particle species – a fermion field.


This way a single σ\sigma-model may encode a rich multiple particle content and we shall speak of a single superparticle with different excitations or modes .
An early proposal for a single unified connection ∇\nabla that would subsume both gravity as well as Yang-Mills forces in a phenomenologically realistic way is the Kaluza-Klein mechanism. This assumes a single Levi-Civita connection but on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold XX which is locally of the product form X 4×F dX_4 \times F_{d} with X 4X_4 a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold and F dF_d a dd-dimensional Riemannian manifold of very small Riemannian volume. As described in more detail at Kaluza-Klein mechanism, this makes the isometry groups of F dF_d appear as extra gauge group factors as seen on X 4X_4. As also described in more detail there, while this Ansatz does reproduce the correct general form of gravity coupled to Yang-Mills forces, in its original form it does also have some phenomenologically unviable aspects.
It was observed by Alain Connes and collaborators that the Kaluza-Klein mechanism works better when used not internal to the category Diff of smooth manifolds but in context for more general geometry: noncommutative geometry. This is the content of the Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model.
This more general geometry turns out to model exactly the most general σ\sigma-model backgrounds for a 1-dimensional FQFT: because such is algebraically specified by


the (Hilbert) space ℋ\mathcal{H} of states that it assigns to the point;


An associative algebra A↪ℋA \hookrightarrow \mathcal{H} whose multiplication operation A⊗A→AA\otimes A \to A is the operator product assigned to the trivalent interaction vertex

A Dirac operator DD whose Dyson formula exponential exp(tD 2+θD)\exp(t D^2 + \theta D) is assigned to a piece of 1-dimensional cobordism of superlength (t,θ)(t, \theta).


This data is that of spectral triple, which is well known to enocode Riemannian noncommutative geometry (rather: spectral geometry ). It is therefore natural to search for a Kaluza-Klein ansatz in spectral geometry that would produce the standard model context.
A very detailed such construction was given by Alain Connes (see the references below).
It turns out that the realistic model has KK-theory dimension D=4+6D = 4+6.
By the result at (1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory this KK-theory dimension is precisely the intrinsic dimension of target space as seen by the superparticle. Moreover, D=4+6D = 4+6 is precisely the dimension for which the 2-dimensional super-CFT sigma-model is critical and hence allows to lift the 1-dimensional superparticle described here to string theory.
This means that Connes’ spectral triple whose particle spectrum reproduces the standard model of particle physics has a chance of being the point particle limit or decategorification of the kind of 2-spectral triple – a 2-dimensional superconformal field theory – of the kind that is considered in string theory. If so the lift of Connes’ model to the corresponding element in the moduli space of 2-spectral triples called the landscape of string theory vacua might provide, via the second quantization of the latter, a (perturbative) quantization of the spectral action of the former.
General idea
In physics the term theory or physical theory traditionally refers, somewhat vaguely, to a given set of notions and rules, usually formulated in the language of mathematics, that describe how some physical system or class of physical systems behaves. Typically these systems are highly idealized, in that the theories describe only certain aspects.
Often a given such theory depends on many free parameters. When a choice of such parameters is made or the range of the parameters is being restricted one tends to call the result a model (in theoretical physics). For more on this see Theories and their Models below.
The most accurate general theory of fundamental physics known is Einstein gravity and quantum field theory. The best available choices of parameters in this general theory that make it fit the specifics of the observed world (phenomenology) are models which accordingly are called the standard models: there is the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology.
Formalization
Beware that, therefore, the use of the terms theory and model in physics is different from the same terms as used in logic (see at theory (logic) and model (logic)).
But most theories of fundamental physics (and many theories of effective physics such as solid state physics) fit into a pattern that can be axiomatized at least to some extent:
these physical theories are specified by a (local/extended) Lagrangian on a space of fields over a given spacetime/worldvolume manifold XX, hence by an action functional
S:[X,Fields] H→U(1).
  S \;\colon\; [X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}} \to U(1)
  \,.


In particular the corresponding classical field theory has as its “space of models” the critical locus
∑ϕ∈[X,Fields] H(dS ϕ≃0)
  \underset{\phi \in [X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}}{\sum}
  ( \mathbf{d} S_\phi \simeq 0 )


of such an action functional, the space of solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations. A point in this space is a single “physically realizable” configuration of fields in this theory, disregarding quantum field theory-corrections, and a small-parameter subspace is often referred to as “a model” of the theory.
In this perspective of classical field theory, two different action functionals on different spaces of fields but with equivalent critical loci are regarded as “equivalent physical theories”. One often sees the term “classically equivalent” for this notion used in the literature.
But the full quantum field theory determined by a Lagrangian/action functional depends on more than just the critical locus, which is just something like the lowest order approximation to the quantum theory (in a sense that can be made precise, for instance in deformation quantization in terms of power series developments in Planck's constant.)
In particle physics
In particle physics phenomenology a model is the specification of a physical theory, fundamentally of a quantum field theory, that reproduces aspects phenomenology, notably the fundamental physics observed in particle accelerators?.
The standard model of particle physics is, by default, the currently best model available, given the available experimental data.
Despite the success of this model, it is conceptually unsatisfactory in many ways and it is clear that it can be a roughly accurate description of reality not high above the currently experimentally available energy-scales. Therefore phenomenologists still “build” plenty of other models that refine the standard model in one way or other, being compatible with the present data, but making various other predictions for what should be observed at higher energies.
It is generally understood that models are approximations to reality. The proverbial saying goes:

Every model is wrong. But some models are useful.

In principle, any interaction between two physical systems is a measurement, whereby each system measures the state of the other. In practice, we break the symmetry by treating one system as the real physical system SS of study and the other system as merely a measuring apparatus AA with the sole purpose of measuring SS. If the properties of AA are more directly observable than those of SS, then this is useful.
The following idea or observation or sentiment has been expressed independently by many authors. We quote from Szudzik 10, section 2:

The central problem is that physical models use real numbers to represent the values of observable quantities, [...][...] Careful consideration of this problem, however, reveals that the real numbers are not actually necessary in physical models. Non-negative integers suffice for the representation of observable quantities because numbers measured in laboratory experiments necessarily have only finitely many digits of precision.

Diverse conclusions have been drawn from this. One which seems useful and well-informed by the theory of computability in mathematics is the following (further quoting from Szudzik 10, section 2)

So, we suffer no loss of generality by restricting the values of all observable quantities to be expressed as non-negative integers — the restriction only forces us to make the methods of error analysis, which were tacitly assumed when dealing with real numbers, an explicit part of each model.

In type-I computability the computable functions are partial recursive functions and in view of this some authors concluded (e.g. Kreisel 74) (and we still quote Szudzik 10, section 2 for this):

To show that a model [[ of physics ]] is computable, the model must somehow be expressed using recursive functions.

A similar sentiment is voiced by Geroch and Hartle:

We propose, in parallel with the notion of a computable number in mathematics, that of a measurable number in a physical theory. The question of whether there exists an algorithm for implementing a theory may then be formulated more precisely as the question of whether the measurable numbers of the theory are computable. We argue that the measurable numbers are in fact computable in the familiar theories of physics, but there is no reason why this need be the case in order that a theory have predictive power. Indeed, in some recent formulations of quantum gravity as a sum ver histories, there are candidates for numbers that are measurable but not computable.

However, in computability theory there is also the concept of type-II computable functions used in the field of “constructive analysis”, “computable analysis”. This is based on the idea that for instance for specifying computable real numbers as used in physics, an algorithm may work not just on single natural numbers, but indefinitely on sequences of them, producing output that is in each step a finite, but in each next step a more accurate approximation.

This concept of type-II computability is arguably closer to actual practice in physics.
Of course there is a wide-spread (but of course controversial) vague speculation (often justified by alluding to expected implications of quantum gravity on the true microscopic nature of spacetime and sometimes formalized in terms of cellular automata, e.g. Zuse 67) that in some sense the observable universe is fundamentally “finite”, so that in the end computability is a non-issue in physics as one is really operating on a large but finite set of states.
However, since fundamental physics is quantum physics and since quantum mechanics with its wave functions, Hilbert spaces and probability amplitudes invokes (functional) analysis and hence “non-finite mathematics” even when describing the minimum of a physical system with only two possible configurations (a “qbit”) a strict finitism perspective on fundamental physics runs into problems (highlighted for instance in (Feynman 81, slide 15)). Precisely this kind of issue is the topic of computable analysis (“constructive analysis”, “exact analysis”) with its type-II notion of computable functions, which would therefore seem to be the right mathematical context discussing computability in fundamental (namely quantum) physics. This point is made in (Weihrauch-Zhong 02) for the wave equation.
This matters: there are solutions to the wave equation with type-I computable initial values which are not themselves type-I computable (Pour-El et al. 83). If type-I computability were the right concept of computabuility in physics, this result would show a violation of the Church-Turing thesis. But in (Weihrauch-Zhong 02) it is argued that the correct concept to use is indeed type-II computability and it is shown (Weihrauch-Zhong 02, theorem 3.2) that the solution operator to the wave equation is indeed type-II computable. The same is shown for the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics in (Weihrauch-Zhong 01, Weihrauch-Zhong 06) where it is found that the Schrödinger operator is computable on the Lebesgue space L pL^p precisely for the physically relevant value p=2p = 2. A similar conclusion is reached by Baez.
In the vein of type-II computability the issue specifically of computable quantum physics/quantum logic has only been further considered in (Streicher 12), where it is shown that at least a fair bit of the Hilbert space technology of quantum mechanics/quantum logic sits inside the function realizability topos RT(𝒦 2)RT(\mathcal{K}_2).
The question whether the observable universe or at least all experiments done within are computable is part of the (strong) physical Church-Turing thesis. See there for more, and see (Waaldijk 03). Experiments showing non-computability in quantum processes have been claimed in (CDDS 10).
In physics the word mechanics refers essentially to every formalization of dynamics. Often the use of the word it may be restricted to mean the dynamics of point particles or rigid body dynamics.
Historically one distinguishes between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics . The full theory of dynamics is nature is given by quantum mechanics, but classical mechanics (named after its full development at the end of the 19th century, before the insights that led to its refinement to quantum mechanics) provides an accurate approximation for “macroscopic” or otherwise “large” systems.
In classical mechanics, the analog of momentum for rotational dynamics is called angular momentum, and is defined as twice the product of the mass and the areal velocity.
In quantum mechanics, the angular momentum quantum observables constitute a representation of the (special) orthogonal group SO(n)SO(n) of nn-dimensional Euclidean space, in applications typically considered for n=3n = 3 or n=2n = 2.
Therefore the theory of quantum angular momentum is that of the irreducible representation of the rotation group.
In the mechanics of rigid body dynamics in Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, the moment of inertia of a rigid body is the analog of mass for rotational dynamics?. In linear dynamics?, we have the formula
p=mv p = m v 
which says that the momentum pp is proportional to the velocity vv. Similarly, in rotational dynamics, we have the analogous formula
L=IΩ L = I \Omega 
where LL is the angular momentum, Ω\Omega is the angular velocity, and II is the moment of inertia.
However, the rotational equation is somewhat more complicated than the linear one: firstly because LL and Ω\Omega are not naturally vectors but bivectors; and secondly because they are not necessarily proportional, so that II cannot be a scalar. In general, the moment of inertia is a linear function
I:∧ 2ℝ n→∧ 2ℝ n
  I \colon \wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n \to \wedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n


so that the above equation becomes simply
L=I(Ω). L = I(\Omega). 
This linear function is additionally symmetric with respect to the induced inner product on ⋀ 2ℝ n\bigwedge^2 \mathbb{R}^n, so it can be represented in coordinates by a symmetric n(n−1)2×n(n−1)2\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \times \frac{n(n-1)}{2} matrix.
Similarly, differentiating this equation once with respect to time (and assuming that II is constant as it is for a rigid body), we have
τ=Iα, \tau = I \alpha ,
relating the total torque τ\tau to the angular acceleration? α\alpha — this is the rotational analogue of Newton's second law F=maF = m a (where mm must be constant).
Many important special cases of classical mechanics involve physical systems whose configuration space is a Lie group, for instance rigid body dynamics but also (for infinite-dimensional Lie groups) fluid dynamics.
All these systems have special properties, notably they are formally integrable systems.
The mechanics of rigid bodies in Cartesian space.
Up to the dynamics of the center of mass?, this is the special case of Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups for the case of the special orthogonal group SO(n)SO(n).
Often this is considered (only) for n=3n = 3, which is the case pertaining to rigid bodies in observable nature, hence using SO(3).
In fundamental physics the basic entities that are being described are called fields, as they appear in the terms classical field theory and quantum field theory.
General
The basic example that probably gives the whole concept its name is the electric field and the magnetic field in the theory of electromagnetism: if we fix a coordinate chart of spacetime, then the electromagnetic field splits into the electric field and the magnetic field which are both modeled by a vector field, traditionally denoted E→\vec E and B→\vec B, respectively, on this coordinate chart. The value E→(x)\vec E(x) of the vector field at a given point of spacetime is a vector that expresses the magnitude and direction of the electric force that is exerted on an electrically charged particle at xx.
In fact more fundamentally, if we do not specify a coordinate chart, then the electromagnetic field is not in fact represented by two vector fields. Rather, its field strength is represented by a differential 2-form, hence a tensor field of rank (0,2)(0,2), but the the whole field as such is not a tensor field, but is a cocycle of degree-2 in ordinary differential cohomology: a circle bundle with connection.
Or for instance the field of gravity if modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian metric is a tensor field of rank (2,0)(2,0) – but subject to the constraint that this be pointwise non-degenerate. More fundamentally the field of gravity is instead a vielbein field.
Similar statements hold for all forces of nature, such as the force of gravity and the weak nuclear force and strong nuclear force: a configuration of these is mathematically modeled by connections. Their field strengths are rank (0,2)(0,2)-tensor fields.
The electromagnetic field and the field of gravity are the physical fields that historically gave rise to what is now called classical field theory. But it turns out that fundamentally, in quantum physics, also all matter in physics is constituted by fields in a similar sense. Specifically, where force fields in physics are usually connections on a bundle, matter fields are sections of associated bundles.
Field theory was originally discovered as a theory of fields on spacetime. But also the physical system consisting of a single particle propagating in a fixed spacetime XX is described by a field theory. In this case the field is not defined on spacetime, but on the abstract worldline of the particle, say the real line ℝ\mathbb{R}. A configuration of the system, namely a trajectory of the particle, is then a smooth function ϕ:ℝ→X\phi \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}\to X. This function may be regarded as a field on the worldline and in then called a sigma-model field. The quantum mechanics of a single particle may be equivalently thought of as a quantum field theory on the 1-dimensional worldline of the particle.
This perspective generalizes. Next one can consider fields on 2-dimensional surfaces Σ 2\Sigma_2 which again are given by maps into some spacetime XX. The corresponding 2-dimensional sigma-model quantum field theory is then said to describe not a particle but a string propagating in spacetime, defined on the worldsheet Σ 2\Sigma_2, replacing the worldline of the particle. For Σ\Sigma of dimension 3 one accordingly speaks of the worldvolume of a membrane and then for Σ\Sigma of general dimension here one speaks of the worldvolume of a brane.
But there is no fundamental distinction between physical fields on spaces that are interpreted as spacetimes and those that are interpreted as worldvolumes of objects propagating in a fixed spacetime. In general these notions mix. For instance the full description of relativistic particles and relativistic strings involves a field that is really a field of gravity on the worldvolume. Conversely, theories on spacetimes that arise by Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional theories typically have “scalar moduli fields” that used to be components of the field of gravity in higher dimensions but now after compactifications become maps into some auxiliary target space, hence again sigma-model fields.
A first idea of quantum fields
We introduce here the basic concepts of Lagrangian field theory, first for prequantum field theory and then for its deformation quantization to perturbative quantum field theory.
In full beauty these concepts are extremely general; but in this section the aim is to give a first good idea of the subject, and therefore we present for the moment only a restricted setup, notably assuming that spacetime is Minkowski spacetime, that the field bundle (see below) is an ordinary and trivial fiber bundle and that all fields are bosonic.
This does subsume what is considered in most traditional texts on the subject. In subsequent sections we will eventually discuss more general situations, notably we will eventually allow spacetime to be any globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold and the field bundle to be an super infinity-Lie algebroid. This is sufficient generality to capture the established perturbative BRST-BV quantization of fermions coupled to gauge fields on curved spacetimes.
Throughout we use the case of the real scalar field as an illustrative running example, which we develop alongside with the theory. The discussion of other field species that are of more genuine interest in applications is postponed to their dedicated sections below.

Thoughout, let
p∈ℕ
  p \in \mathbb{N}


be a natural number and write
Σ≔ℝ p,1≔(ℝ p+1,η)
  \Sigma \coloneqq \mathbb{R}^{p,1} \coloneqq (\mathbb{R}^{p+1}, \eta)


for Minkowski spacetime of dimension p+1p+1, hence for the smooth manifold which is the Cartesian space ℝ p+1\mathbb{R}^{p+1} of dimension p+1p+1 equipped with the constant pseudo-Riemannian metric η\eta which at the origin is given by the standard quadratic form of signature

  (-, +, \cdots, +)


in terms of the canonical coordinate functions
x k:ℝ p+1⟶ℝ
  x^k \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{p+1} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}


which we index starting at zero: (x k) k=0 p(x^k)_{k = 0}^p.
We write
dvol Σ∶−dx 0∧dx 1∧⋯∧dx p∈Ω p+1(ℝ p,1)
  dvol_\Sigma
   \;\coloneq\;
  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p
  \in \Omega^{p+1}(\mathbb{R}^{p,1})


for the induced volume form, and we call
dx 0∈Ω 1(Σ)
  d x^0 \in \Omega^1(\Sigma)


the canonical representative of the canonical time orientation on Minkowski spacetime.
Fields
A field configuration on a given spacetime Σ\Sigma is meant to be some kind of quantity assigned to each point of spacetime (each event), such that this assignment varies smoothly with spacetime points. For instance an electromagnetic field configuration is at each point of spacetime a collection of vectors that encode the direction in which a charged particle passing through that point will feel a force (the Lorentz force).
This is readily formalized: If
F∈SmthMfd
  F \in SmthMfd


is the smooth manifold of “values” that the the given kind of field may take at any spacetime point, then a field configuration Φ\Phi is modeled as a smooth function from spacetime to this space of values:
Φ:Σ⟶F.
  \Phi
    \;\colon\;
   \Sigma
     \longrightarrow
   F
  \,.


It will be useful to unify spacetime and the space of field values into a single space, the Cartesian product
E≔Σ×F
  E \;\coloneqq\; \Sigma \times F


and to think of this equipped with the projection map onto the first factor as a fiber bundle of spaces of field values over spacetime
E ≔ Σ×F  fb↓ ↙ pr 1 Σ.
  \array{
     E &\coloneqq& \Sigma \times F
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{fb}}\downarrow & \swarrow_{\mathrlap{pr_1}}
     \\
     \Sigma
  }
  \,.


This is then called the field bundle, which specifies the kind of values that the given field species may take at any point of spacetime. Since the space FF of field values is the fiber of this fiber bundle, it is sometimes also called the field fiber.

Definition
(fields)
Given a spacetime Σ\Sigma and a field bundle E ↓ fb Σ\array{E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}} \\ \Sigma }, then a field configuration (of type specified by this field bundle) is a smooth section of this bundle, namely a smooth function of the form Φ:Σ⟶E\Phi \colon \Sigma \longrightarrow E such that composed with the projection map it is the identity function, i.e. such that fb∘Φ=idfb \circ \Phi = id, or, diagrammatically, such that
  E   Φ↗ ↓ fb Σ = Σ.
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    \Sigma & = & \Sigma
  }
  \,.


The field configuration space is the smooth space of all these, to be denoted
Γ Σ(E)∈SmoothSet.
  \Gamma_\Sigma(E) \in SmoothSet
  \,.


This is the set of all field configurations Φ\Phi as above, and it is equipped with the structure of a smooth set by declaring that a smooth family of field configurations, parameterized over any Cartesian space UU is a smooth function
U×Σ ⟶Φ (−)(−) E (u,x) ↦ Φ u(x)
  \array{
    U \times \Sigma &\overset{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}{\longrightarrow}& E
    \\
    (u,x) &\mapsto& \Phi_u(x)
  }


such that for each u∈Uu \in U we have p∘Φ u(−)=id Σp \circ \Phi_{u}(-) = id_\Sigma, i.e.
  E   Φ (−)(−)↗ ↓ fb U×Σ ⟶pr 2 Σ.
  \array{
    && E
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\Phi_{(-)}(-)}}\nearrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{fb}}
    \\
    U \times \Sigma &\underset{pr_2}{\longrightarrow}& \Sigma
  }
  \,.



Example
(trivial vector bundle as a field bundle)
In applications the field fiber FF is often a finite dimensional Euclidean space and equipped with the structure of a vector space. In this case the trivial field bundle with fiber FF is of course a trivial vector bundle.
Choosing any linear basis (ϕ a) a=1 s(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s of the field fiber, then over Minkowski spacetime we have canonical coordinates on the total space of the field bundle
((x μ) μ=0 p,(ϕ a) a=1 s).
  ( (x^\mu)_{\mu = 0}^p, ( \phi^a )_{a = 1}^s )
  \,.



Example
(real scalar field)
If Σ\Sigma is a spacetime and if
F≔ℝ
  F \coloneqq \mathbb{R}


is simply the real line, then the corresponding trivial field bundle
Σ×ℝ  pr 1↓ Σ
  \array{
    \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{pr_1}}\downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma
  }


is the trivial real line bundle (a special case of example ) and the corresponding field is called the real scalar field on Σ\Sigma. A configuration of this field is simply a smooth function on Σ\Sigma with values in the real numbers:
Γ Σ(Σ×ℝ)≃C ∞(Σ).
  \Gamma_\Sigma(\Sigma \times \mathbb{R})
    \;\simeq\;
  C^\infty(\Sigma)
  \,.


Field variations
Given a field bundle as above, we know what type of quantities the corresponding fields assign to a given spacetime point. Among all consistent such field configurations, some are to qualify as those that “may occur in reality” if we think of the field theory as a means to describe parts of the observable universe. Moreover, if the reality to be described does not exhibit “action at a distance” then admissibility of its field configurations should be determined over arbitrary small spacetime regions, in fact over the infinitesimal neighbourhood of any point. This means equivalently that the realized field configurations should be those that satisfy a specific differential equation, hence an equation between the value of its derivatives at any spacetime point.
In order to formalize this, it is useful to first collect all the possible derivatives that a field may have at any given point into one big space of “field derivatives at spacetime points”. This collection is called the jet bundle of the field bundle, given as def.  below.
Moving around in this space means to change the possible value of fields and their derivatives, hence to vary the fields. Accordingly variational calculus is just differential calculus on a jet bundle, this we consider in def.  below.

Definition
(jet bundle of a trivial vector bundle over Minkowski spacetime)
Given a field fiber vector space F=ℝ sF = \mathbb{R}^s with linear basis (ϕ a) a=1 s(\phi^a)_{a = 1}^s, then for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} a natural number, the order-kk jet bundle
J Σ k(E) ↓ jb k Σ

    J^k_{\Sigma}( E )

    \Sigma
  }


over Minkowski spacetime Σ\Sigma of the trivial vector bundle
E≔Σ×F
  E \coloneqq \Sigma \times F


is the Cartesian space which is spanned by coordinate functions to be denoted as follows:
((x μ),(ϕ a),(ϕ ,μ a),(ϕ ,μ 1μ 2 a),⋯,(ϕ ,μ 1⋯μ k a))
  \left(
     (x^\mu)
     \,,\,
     (\phi^a )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu} )
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1\mu_2} )
     \,,\,
     \cdots
     \,,\,
     ( \phi^a_{,\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} )
  \right)


where the indices μ,μ 1,μ 2,⋯\mu, \mu_1, \mu_2, \cdots range from 0 to pp, while the index aa ranges from 11 to ss. In terms of these coordinates the bundle projection map jb kjb_k is just the one that remembers the spacetime coordinates x μx^\mu and forgets the values of the field ϕ a\phi^a and its derivatives ϕ μ\phi_{\mu}. Similarly there are intermediate projection maps

given by forgetting coordinates with more indices.
The infinite-order jet bundle
J Σ ∞(E)∈SmoothSet
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \in SmoothSet


is the smooth set defined so that a smooth function
U⟶fJ Σ ∞(E)
  U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} J^\infty_\Sigma(E)


from some Cartesian space UU is equivalently a system of ordinary smooth functions
(U⟶f kJ Σ k(E)) k∈ℕ
  \left(
    U \overset{f_k}{\longrightarrow} J^k_\Sigma(E)
  \right)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}


into all the finite-order jet bundles, such that this is compatible with the above projection maps, i.e. such that
∀k∈ℕ(jb k+1,k∘f k+1=f k).
  \underset{k \in \mathbb{N}}{\forall} \left(
    jb_{k+1,k} \circ f_{k+1} = f_k
  \right)
  \,.


Finally jet prolongation is that function from the space of sections of the original bundle to the space of sections of the jet bundle which records the field Φ\Phi and all its spacetimes derivatives:
Γ Σ(E) ⟶j ∞ Γ Σ(J Σ ∞(E)) (Φ a) ↦ ((Φ a),(∂Φ a∂x μ),(∂ 2Φ a∂x μ 1∂x μ 2),⋯).
  \array{
    \Gamma_\Sigma(E)
      &\overset{j^\infty}{\longrightarrow}&
    \Gamma_\Sigma(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
    \\
    (\Phi^a)
    &\mapsto&
    \left(
      (\Phi^a)
      \,,\,
      ( \frac{\partial \Phi^a}{\partial x^\mu} )
      \,,\,
      ( \frac{\partial^2 \Phi^a}{\partial x^{\mu_1} \partial x^{\mu_2}} )
      \,,\,
      \cdots
    \right)
  }
  \,.


Smooth functions on jet bundles turn out to locally depend on only finitely many of the jet coordinates:

Proposition
Given a jet bundle J Σ ∞(E)J^\infty_\Sigma(E) as in def. , then a smooth function out of it
J Σ ∞(E)⟶X
  J^\infty_\Sigma(E) \longrightarrow X


is such that around each point of J Σ ∞(E)J^\infty_\Sigma(E) there is a neighbourhood U⊂J Σ ∞(E)U \subset J^\infty_\Sigma(E) on which it is given by a function on a smooth function on J Σ k(E)J^k_\Sigma(E) for some finite kk.


Definition
(variational bicomplex)
On the jet bundle J Σ ∞(E)J^\infty_\Sigma(E) of a trivial vector bundle over Minkowski spacetime as in def.  we may consider its de Rham complex of differential forms; we write its de Rham differential in boldface:
d:Ω •(J Σ ∞(E))⟶Ω •+1(J Σ ∞(E)).
  \mathbf{d} \;\colon\; \Omega^\bullet(J^\infty_\Sigma(E)) \longrightarrow \Omega^{\bullet+1}(J^\infty_\Sigma(E))
  \,.


Since the jet bundle unified spacetime with field values, we want to decompose this differential into a contribution coming from forming the total derivatives of fields along spacetime (“horizontal derivatives”), and actual variation of fields at a fixed spacetime point (“vertical derivatives”):
The total spacetime derivative or horizontal derivative on J Σ ∞(E)J^\infty_\Sigma(E) is the map on differential forms on the jet bundle of the form
d:Ω •(J Σ ∞(E))⟶Ω •+1(J Σ ∞(E))
  d
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^\bullet( J^\infty_\Sigma(E) )

Example
(basic facts about variational calculus)
Given the jet bundle of a field bundle as in def. , then in its variational bicomplex (def. ) we have the following:


The horizontal derivative of a spacetime coordinate function x μx^\mu coincides with its ordinary de Rham differential
dx μ=dx μ∈Ω 1,0(E)
  d x^\mu = \mathbf{d} x^\mu \in \Omega^{1,0}(E)


and hence this is a horizontal 1-form.


Therefore the vertical derivative of a spacetime coordinate vanishes:
δx μ=0.
  \delta x^\mu = 0
  \,.



In particular the given volume form on Σ\Sigma gives a horizontal p+1p+1-form
dvol Σ=dx 0∧dx 1∧⋯∧dx p∈Ω p+1,0.
  dvol_\Sigma =  d x^0 \wedge d x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^p \in \Omega^{p+1,0}
  \,.



Generally any horizontal kk-form is of the form
f μ 1⋯μ kdx μ 1∧⋯∧dx μ k∈Ω k,0(E)
  f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} d x^{\mu_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d x^{\mu_k}
  \;\in\;
  \Omega^{k,0}(E)


for f μ 1⋯μ k=f μ 1⋯μ k((x μ),(ϕ a),(ϕ ,μ a))f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k} = f_{\mu_1 \cdots \mu_k}\left((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu})\right) any smooth function of the spacetime coordinates and the field coordinates.


The horizontal differential of the vertical differential δϕ\delta \phi of a field variable is the differential 2-form of horizontal degree 1 and vertical degree 2 given by
d(δϕ a) =−δ(dϕ a)  =−(δϕ ,μ a)∧dx μ.
  \begin{aligned}
    d (\delta \phi^a)
    & =
    -
    \delta (d \phi_a)
    \\
    & =
    - (\delta \phi^a_{,\mu}) \wedge \mathbf{d} x^\mu
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


In words this says that “the spacetime derivative of the variation of the field is the variation of its spacetime derivative”.




Definition
(local Lagrangian density)
Given a field bundle EE over a (p+1)(p+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime Σ\Sigma as in example , then a local Lagrangian density L\mathbf{L} (for the field species thus defined) is a horizontal differential form of degree (p+1)(p+1) on the corresponding jet bundle (def. ):
L∈Ω p+1,0(E).
  \mathbf{L} \;\in \; \Omega^{p+1,0}(E)
  \,.


By example  any such Lagrangian density may uniquely be written as
L=Ldvol Σ
  \mathbf{L} = L dvol_\Sigma


with L=L((x μ),(ϕ a),(ϕ ,μ a),⋯)L = L((x^\mu), (\phi^a), (\phi^a_{,\mu}), \cdots )  a smooth function on the jet bundle.


Proposition
(Euler-Lagrange operator)
If a Lagrangian density L\mathbf{L} as in def. , then its de Rham differential has a unique decomposition as a sum of two terms
dL=δ ELL−dΘ
  \mathbf{d} \mathbf{L}
  =
  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L}
  -
  d \Theta


such that δ EL\delta_{EL} is a “source form”:
δ ELL∈Ω p+1,0(E)∧δΩ 0,0(E)⊂Ω p+1,1(E).
  \delta_{EL} \mathbf{L} \in \Omega^{p+1,0}(E) \wedge \delta \Omega^{0,0}(E) \; \subset \Omega^{p+1,1}(E)
  \,.


The map
δ EL:Ω p+1,0(E)⟶Ω s p+1,1(E)
   \delta_{EL} \;\colon\; \Omega^{p+1,0}(E) \longrightarrow \Omega^{p+1,1}_s(E)


thus defined is called the Euler-Lagrange operator and is explicitly given by
δ ELLdvol Σ ≔δLδϕ aδϕ a∧dvol Σ  ≔(∂L∂ϕ a−ddx μ∂L∂ϕ ,μ a+d 2dx μ 1dx μ 2∂L∂ϕ μ 1,μ 2 a−⋯)δϕ a∧dvol Σ.

denotes the contraction of the volume form with the vector field ∂ μ\partial_\mu.


Proof
Using L=Ldvol Σ\mathbf{L} = L dvol_\Sigma and that dL=0d \mathbf{L} = 0 by degree reasons, we find
dL =(∂L∂ϕ aδϕ a+∂L∂ϕ ,μ aδϕ ,μ a+∂L∂ϕ ,μ 1μ 2 aδϕ ,μ 1μ 2 a+⋯)∧dvol Σ.

The idea now is to have dΘd \Theta pick up those terms that would appear as boundary terms under the integral ∫ Σj ∞(Φ) *dL\int_\Sigma j^\infty(\Phi)^\ast \mathbf{d}L if we were to consider integration by parts to remove spacetime derivatives of δϕ a\delta \phi^a.
We compute, using example , the total horizontal derivative of Θ\Theta from (1) as follows:

Given a field bundle EE over spacetime Σ\Sigma as in example  equipped with a local Lagrangian density L∈Ω p+1,1(E)\mathbf{L} \in  \Omega^{p+1,1}(E) as in def.  then the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation of motion on fields Φ∈Γ Σ(E)\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E) is the equation
j ∞(Φ) *(δ ELL)=0,

By that same proposition this equation is equivalently the differential equation

The traditional idea of field bundles and its problems
A traditional approach to formalizing the notion of physical field is to declare that the specification of a theory in physics/physical system comes with a fiber bundle E→XE \to X over the spacetime/worldvolume XX (or better: naturally over all spacetimes, see at Locality below) called the field bundle and that a field configuration of the system is a section of this field bundle. This is for instance the basis for the theory of the variational bicomplex, hence of BV-BRST formalism for expressing covariant phase spaces, for standard multisymplectic geometry, etc.
While this goes in the right direction, it cannot be quite the final answer, as it misses crucial properties that are demanded of a general notion of field. We now discuss these problems:


Large gauge transformations


Locality


Spin structures and other G-structures


Background fields


Higher gauge fields


In the course of discussing the problems we also motivate and indicate their solution by a more natural notion of field moduli in higher geometry. This is then discussed in full detail in the Definition-section below.
Large gauge transformations
In gauge theory specifically but in physics generally, physical fields come equipped with a notion of which fields configurations, while nominally different, are equivalent, called gauge equivalent and it is crucial to retain the information of gauge equivalences and not pass to equivalence classes of gauge equivalent fields. This means that generically for any physical theory, even if all field configurations would be represented by a section of some field bundle, many such sections are in fact to be regarded as being equivalent. Or more precisely, there should be a groupoid or ∞-groupoid of field configurations of which the sections of the field bundle only form the space of objects, while the gauge transformations form the morphisms and the higher gauge transformations of order nn form the n-morphisms.
To some extent this is dealt with in traditional variational calculus: after a choice of action functional on the space of field configurations, BV-BRST formalism spits out a derived L-∞ algebroid whose objects are field configurations, and whose 1-cells are infinitesimal invariances of the given action functional.
This goes in the right direction– it is the Lie differentiation of the more encompassing smooth ∞-groupoid of fields and gauge transformations – but has several problems, the main one being that this does now know about the large gauge transformations, those which are not connected to the identity (because it only sees infinitesimal data). These are important in the full quantum theory.
Famous examples of the importance of large gauge transformations appear in

2d CFT, for which all standard theory would break down if the global conformal transformations were not considered as gauge transformations.

Locality
Fields defined as sections of field bundles cannot capture gauge phenomena in a local way, as is necessary for a manifestly local formulation such in extended prequantum field theory, extended quantum field theory (sometimes called the “multi-tiered” formulation).
Specifically, in Yang-Mills theory for gauge group GG, a field configuration – a gauge field configuration – is a combination of an instanton sector – modeled by the equivalence class of a GG-principal bundle PP – and the “gauge potential”, modeled by a connection on this bundle (see below at Gauge fields for details). There is a fiber bundle E(P)→XE(P) \to X such that its sections are precisely the connections on P→XP \to X, and so ∐ cE(P c)→X\coprod_{c} E(P_c) \to X, where cc ranges over the instanton sectors, is a field bundle for Yang-Mills fields on XX.
But this construction is not local: if we consider this assignment of field bundles to all suitable manifolds XX, and if U→XU \to X is a cover of XX, then we cannot in general obtain the field bundle on XX by gluing the field bundle on the cover. This is because locally every GG-principal bundle has trivial class, so that locally there is always only a single (the trivial) instanton sector.
This failure of locality is often not recognized in the literature, since many if not most descriptions of physics restrict to trivial spacetime topology and/or restrict to perturbation theory only. A formulation accurate and encompassing enough to see this issue is AQFT on curved spacetimes. A reference that explicitly runs into this non-locality issue of the field bundle in gauge theory in this context is (Benini-Dappiaggi-Schenkel 13, Schenkel 14): the authors define a functor from spacetimes equipped with a GG-principal bundle that assigns the algebras of observables of the corresponding Yang-Mills fields built from the field bundle of connections on the given principal bundles; and they observe that the result fails to be a local net in that the inclusion of observables of a smaller spacetime into a larger patch may fail the isotony axiom (BDS, remark 5.6). The authors then try to circumvent this by restricting to trivial instanton sectors. The fix later appears in (Benini-Schenkel-Szabo 15), where the authors then consider proper stacks of fields.
But notice that instanton sectors is a non-negligible phenomenon. For instance the very vacuum in the standard model of particle physics is a superposition of all possible instanton sectors (see at instanton in QCD for more on this). And there are field theories where the fields consist entirely of “instanton sectors” and where there is no infinitesimal information about the gauge group at all: these are theories whose gauge group is a discrete group, which includes notably Dijkgraaf-Witten theory and its higher analogy such as the Yetter model. This means that for these theories a local field bundle formalism can see nothing of the actual fields and also traditional tools applied to a global field bundle (such as traditional BV-BRST formalism) see nothing of the actual fields. All this is fixed by the formulation that we discuss below.
But this example already points to the general nature of the problem with field bundles, and also to its solution: while the instanton-component of Yang-Mills fields are not section of a bundle, they famously are sections of a stack – the “moduli stack BG\mathbf{B}G of GG-principal bundles”, an object in higher geometry.
The problem with the locality of the field bundle for Yang-Mills theory is solved by passing from fiber bundles to fiber ∞-bundles: in the higher differential geometry there is an object BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} – the moduli stack of GG-principal connections (being the stackification of the groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms) such that maps X→BG connX \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn} are equivalent to Yang-Mills fields on XX (even including their gauge transformations). This means that if we allow field bundles in higher geometry – fiber ∞-bundles, then that for Yang-Mills theory over XX is even a trivial field bundle, namely the projection
X×BG conn→X
     X \times \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to X
   

out of the product of spacetime with the moduli stack of fields.
This is a differential refinement of what is called the trivial GG-gerbe on XX, which is
X×BG→X
     X \times \mathbf{B}G \to X
   

and hence the “field bundle for instanton sectors” of Yang-Mills fields.
In summary: there cannot be a fiber bundle such that its sheaf of local sections is the sheaf of configurations of the Yang-Mills field. But there is a fiber 2-bundle whose stack of sections is the stack of configurations of the Yang-Mills field.
Judging from these examples one might be tempted to guess that the notion of field fiber bundle should simply be replaced by that of field fiber ∞-bundle. But in fact what the example rather suggests is that what matters directly is the moduli stack Fields\mathbf{Fields} of fields, which for GG-Yang-Mills theory is simply
Fields=BG conn.
     \mathbf{Fields} = \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \,.
   

This perspective, which we describe in detail below also has the pleasant effect that it drastically simplifies and unifies notions of quantum field theory, for this says equivalently that if only we allow spaces in higher geometry, then Yang-Mills theory is a sigma-model quantum field theory: one whose fields are simply maps to a given target space, only that this target space here is a stack.
But there are more advantages, slightly less obvious. These we come to in the following points.
Spin-structures and other GG-structures
Some fields in physics are (or involve) choices of G-structure in the sense of reduction and lift of structure groups. Well-known examples include the choice of orientation and of Spin structure in field theories with fermion fields (discussed in detail in Fermions below). Often in the literature the choice of orientation and Spin structure is treated as an external parameter, but detailed analysis at least in low-dimensional examples shows that the in the full theory this is really a field configuration. For instance in path integral quantization for theories with fermions, part of the integral over all field configurations is a sum over Spin structures.
Now, a spin structure is equivalently a section of something, but again not of a principal bundle, but of an analog in higher geometry, a principal 2-bundle.
To see how this works, first recall the case of orientations, whose description as sections of the orientation bundle is familiar.
For a spacetime represented by a smooth manifold XX of dimension nn, let
τ X:X→BGL(n)
  \tau_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)


be the map that modulates its tangent bundle (discussed at geometry of physics - tangent bundle). Consider then the following diagram, which shows lifts of this map to the classifying spaces/moduli stacks for various other groups (this is the Whitehead tower of BO(n)\mathbf{B}O(n)):
  ⋮   ↓   BSpin(n) →12p 1 B 3U(1)  s X↗ ↓   BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2   o X↗ ↓ X →e X BO(n) →w 1 Bℤ 2   τ X↘ ↓   BGL(n)
  \array{
    && \vdots
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}Spin(n) &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
    \\
    &\mathllap{s_X}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}^{\mathllap{o_X}}\nearrow& \downarrow
    \\
    X & \stackrel{e_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}O(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
    \\
    &{}_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}} \searrow& \downarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }


A lift of the tangent bundle map τ X\tau_X to a map e X:X→BO(n)e_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}O(n) as indicated is a choice of orthogonal structure (a vielbein field, discussed in detail below in Ordinary gravity). For the present discussion assume that this is given.
The a further lift to o X:X→BSO(n)o_X : X \to \mathbf{B}SO(n) is a choice of orientation, and finally a lift to s X:X→BSpin(n)s_X : X \to \mathbf{B}Spin(n) is a choice of spin structure.
Now, every hook-shaped sub-diagram in the above of the form
BG^ ↓ BG →c B nA
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\hat G
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^n A
  }


is a homotopy fiber sequence. By the universal property of the homotopy pullback this means that the “space” – really: homotopy type or just type, for short – of lifts of a given map X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G to a map X→BG^X \to \mathbf{B}\hat G is equivalently the type of trivializations of the composite X→BG→cB nAX \to \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n A.
Now if we have an orthogonal structure e X:X→BO(n)e_X : X \to \mathbf{B}O(n) given, then this composite map according to the above diagram is
w 1(e X):X→Bℤ 2.
  \mathbf{w}_1(e_X)
  \;\colon\;
  X \to \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2
  \,.


This represents the first Stiefel-Whitney class [w 1(τ X)]∈H 1(X,ℤ 2)[w_1(\tau_X)] \in H^1(X, \mathbb{Z}_2) of τ X\tau_X, and it classifies a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-principal bundle, hence a double cover X^→X\hat X \to X and this is precisely the orientation bundle of XX. Sections of this bundle are choices of orientation on XX, hence are “orientation-structure fields”.
Assume then such orientation field o Xo_X is given. Then in the next step the relevant composite map is
w 2(o X):X→B 2ℤ 2.
  \mathbf{w}_2(o_X) \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  \,.


This now represents the second Stiefel-Whitney class [w 2(τ X)]∈H 2(X,ℤ 2)[w_2(\tau_X)] \in H^2(X, \mathbb{Z}_2) of XX and classifies a (Bℤ 2)(\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2)-principal 2-bundle
Bℤ 2 → P   ↓   X.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2 &\to& P
    \\
    && \downarrow 
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.


This is sometimes called the SpinSpin-lifting bundle gerbe of o Xo_X. A choice of Spin structure is a choice of section of this 2-bundle. Hence spin structures are parts of fields in physics which are not sections of a field 1-bundle. Again, this is faithfully captured only in higher geometry.
This is only the most famous phenomenon in a large class of similar structures of fields in field theory. Notably in higher dimensional supergravity and in string theory there are fields which are ever higher lifts through this Whitehead tower – higher spin structures, such as String structures and Fivebrane structures in the next two steps. Accordingly, these are fields which are equivalently sections of principal 3-bundles (the “Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle”) and principal 7-bundles (the “Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle”).
Background fields
Comparison of the above discussions under Locality and Spin structures shows that there we had a higher-geometric field bundle of Yang-Mills fields which was hower “trivial” in the sense that it was a projection out of the product of spacetime with a moduli stack, so that a field configuration was equivalently of sigma-model-type, namely simply a map ϕ::X→BG conn\phi \colon : X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}; whereas here the “spin-lifting 2-bundles” and its higher analogs are, in general, not of this product form, hence “Spin structure”-fields, at least superficially do not seem to be of sigma-model-type, even in higher geometry.
But a closer inspection shows that in fact both situations are entirely analogous – once we realize that here these Spin-structure fields are not really defined just on XX, but on XX equipped with its orientation o Xo_X. Since, by the same logic as above, also the orientation is a “field”, we may call it a background field. It serves as “background” over which spin structure fields can be considered.
In higher geometry incarnated naturally as higher topos theory, this state of affairs is naturally modeled and indeed yields again a moduli stack of spin structure fields and makes spin-structures be sigma-model-type fields, as follows:
the natural way to regard both XX as well as its orientation structure o Xo_X as a single object is to regard the map X→o XBSO(n)X \stackrel{o_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}SO(n) as an object in the slice (2,1)-topos H /BSO(n)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}SO(n)}. In here an object is a map of stacks into BSO(n)\mathbf{B}SO(n), and a morphism is map of the domains of these maps together with a homotopy filling the evident triangle diagram. Notably a lift of the orientation structure o Xo_X to a spin structure s Xs_X as above, hence a diagram of the form
X  →s X  BSpin(n)   o X↘ ⇙ ≃ ↙ SpinStruc n   BSO(n)
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{s_X}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}Spin(n)
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{o_X}}\searrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{SpinStruc}_n}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}SO(n)
  }


is equivalently a map
o X→SpinStruc n
  o_X \to \mathbf{SpinStruc}_n


in H /BSO(n)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}SO(n)}. This is again of the same simple form of the Yang-Mills fields on XX, which are maps
X→BG conn,
  X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \,,


but in the collection of stacks H\mathbf{H} itself, not in a slice.
The slice here encodes the presence of background fields – namely orientations in this case – whose moduli stack in turn is, in this case, BSO(n)\mathbf{B}SO(n).
Notice that also the field of gravity has a background field in this precise sense: as metioned above, a gravitational field configuration is a lift of τ X\tau_X through BO(n)→OrthStruc nBGL(n)\mathbf{B}O(n) \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to} \mathbf{B}GL(n), hence a map
τ X→OrthStruc n
  \tau_X \to \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n


in the slice H /BGL(n)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)}. (Discussed in detail in Ordinary gravity below.) Hence also gravity becomes a sigma-model-type field theory in higher geometry. Notice that here it is smooth structure on XX, as embodied in τ X\tau_X, which is the background.
Now, at least for the field of gravity one can of course emulate the fields also by sections of a field bundle (while already for the second next step in the Whitehead tower, Spin structures, this is no longer the case, as we have seen). But even so, the field bundle formalism clearly misses then the relation between fields and background fields.
In particular for two reasons


Typically the presence of background fields indicates that in a more comprehensive discussion background fields are also fields that vary;


Often background fields on one space affect fields on another space.


An archetypical example for both these effects combined is 3d Chern-Simons theory with a compact, simple and simply connected gauge group GG in the presence of Wilson lines. This is a theory on 3-dimensional spacetime/worldvolume Σ\Sigma whose fields are GG-gauge fields as for Yang-Mills theory above, hence given by maps Φ:Σ→BG conn\Phi \colon \Sigma \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}. At the same time, this theory has a “coupling” to a 1-dimensional theory which describes particles propagating around knots C:S 1→ΣC : S^1 \to \Sigma in Σ\Sigma for which the restriction Φ| C\Phi|_C serves as the background gauge field. Specifically, a field configuration of this 1-dimensional theory is equivalently a map in the slice H /BG conn\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G_{conn}} which in H\mathbf{H} is given by a diagram of the form
S 1  →  Ω 1(−,𝔤//T)   C↘ ⇙ ↙ OrbitStruct   BG conn
  \array{
   S^1 &&\to&& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g}//T)
   \\
   & {}_{\mathllap{C}}\searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{OrbitStruct}}}
   \\
   && \mathbf{B}G_{conn} 
  }


for some map on the right which we discuss in detail below in Chern-Simons fields with Wilson line fields.
Here considering just these fields in the background of a fixed Φ| C\Phi|_C produced a 1-dimensional quantum field theory whose partition function is that “Wilson loop” observable of Φ| C\Phi|_C. But this is not considered in isolation. The whole point of the relation of Chern-Simons theory to the Jones polynomial knot invariant of the knot CC is that one consider also Φ\Phi as a dynamical field, not as a fixed background. Indeed, in the full theory of Chern-Simons with Wilson loops that includes both the fields on Σ\Sigma as well as those on the knot, a field configuration is the diagram as above but regarded as the square
S 1 → Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T  C↓ ⇙ ↓ OrbitStruc Σ →Φ BG conn,
  \array{
    S^1 &\to& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{C}}\downarrow 
    &\swArrow& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{OrbitStruc}}}
    \\
    \Sigma &\stackrel{\Phi}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  }
  \,,


hence, again, a single map
C→OrbiStruc
  C \to \mathbf{OrbiStruc}


but now in the arrow (∞,1)-topos H (Δ 1)\mathbf{H}^{(\Delta^1)}.
This subtle interplay of “bulk fields” and “defect fields” which is here captured most naturally in terms of higher geometry cannot really be expressed accurately just in terms of field bundles.
Higher gauge fields
Above we have seen the generalization of field bundles to higher geometry already for traditional notions such as Yang-Mills fields and Spin-structures. But many theories considered in in theoretical physics have fields that are more “explicitly” entities in higher geometry.
For instance the higher analog of the electromagnetic field which is called the B-field or Kalb-Ramond field is a 2-connection on a principal 2-bundle. There is no way to faithfully encode this as a section of any ordinary fiber bundle. It follows that for instance also the magnetic charge anomaly (as discussed there) has no accurate description in terms of field bundles. Next the supergravity C-field is a 3-connection on a principal 3-bundle, and so on.
There is a wide variety of higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories whose fields are such higher gauge fields. In some traditional literature one sees parts of this theory be discussed by standard BV-BRST formalism applied to field bundles, namely by ignoring the non-trivial instanton sectors and pretending that a field configuration for these ∞-connections are given by globally dedined differential forms. In some special cases (for instance for spacetimes/worldvolumes of very special topology or low dimension) this can be sufficient to capture everything, but in general (for instance for U(1)U(1)-higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory and its holographically dual self-dual higher gauge theory) it is not.
The solution: Field ∞\infty-bundles and moduli ∞\infty-stacks of fields
By the above, defining a physical field to be a section of some bundle goes in the right direction, but misses crucial aspects of physical fields. These problems are fixed by passing to higher geometry.
Below in Definition we discuss a natural unified formulation of the notion of physical field in terms of higher geometry (the central definition being def.  ) and then we spell out many Examples.
This definition turns out to be equivalent, at least under mild conditions, to a formulation where fields are sections of an associated ∞-bundle, hence a “field ∞\infty-bundle”. This we discuss in Properties – Relation of fields to sections of ∞-bundles. But this is just one of several equivalent perspectives on physical fields, and not always the most transparent one. In fact, sections of higher associated bundles are best known in the literature on twisted cohomology and indeed one equivalent characterization of fields is as cocycles in twisted cohomology in the general sense of cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos. This we discuss below in Relation to twisted cohomology.
In summary we find and discuss that
fields≃\simeqtwisted relative cohesive cocycles
We distinguish four broad classes of examples of physical fields, according to def. :


Scalar and moduli fields
The simplest type of field is a (smooth) function on spacetime XX with values in the real numbers or complex numbers, called a scalar field. Slightly more generally there are fields which are functions into some other vector space or more general manifold, often called linear/non-linear sigma-model fields. Often that manifold is a space of parameters of some geometry, for instance of a compact space in Kaluza-Klein compactification, in which case these fields are often called moduli fields. Scalar fields may be charged under force fields, which we turn to next.


Force fields


Fields of gravity, G-structure and generalized geometry
In this case the background gauge field is a G-structure, the moduli stack of fields is a delooped ∞-group extension BG^→FieldsBG\mathbf{B}\hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G and a field is a generalized vielbein exhibiting a reduction/lift of structure group.


Gauge fields
In this case Fields\mathbf{Fields} is a moduli space BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of ∞-connections on GG-principal ∞-bundles for some gauge group G∈Grpd(H)G \in Grpd(\mathbf{H}).




Matter fields
In this case the background gauge field is a GG-principal ∞-bundle PP for some gauge group G∈Grp(H)G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) and Fields\mathbf{Fields} is the univeral ρ\rho-associated ∞-bundle V//G→FieldsBGV//G \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G for ρ\rho an ∞-action of GG on some V∈HV \in \mathbf{H}. A field is section of the associated VV-fiber ∞-bundle.


Not all examples fall squarely into one of these types, some are mixtures of these. Relevant examples we discuss in

Fields combining various of these properties

In particular the moduli stacks BG\mathbf{B}G here are typically all differentially refined to moduli stacks BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of ∞-connections so that for instance every reduction and lift of structure groups goes along with a corresponding data of the reduction of an ∞-connection. The archetypical example for this are spin connections, see the example Ordinary gravity below.

0) Sigma-model fields
Traditionally a sigma-model field is a type of fields given simply by (smooth) functions Σ→X\Sigma \to X from a worldvolume Σ\Sigma to a target space XX. Now, by the general unified definition def.  and as shown in the following sections, in higher geometry every type of field is of this form if we allow target space XX to be a general ∞-stack and functions to be maps in a suitable slice (∞,1)-topos. Nevertheless, here we start with briefly indicating those examples that are sigma-model fields also in the traditional restrictive sense of the term.
Uncharged scalar field
A scalar field is given simply by a function on spacetime/worldvolume, typically with values in the real numbers ℝ\mathbb{R} (“real scalar field”) or the complex numbers ℂ\mathbb{C} (“complex scalar field”). Hence this is the example of def.  with trivial background fields
BgFields≔*
  \mathbf{BgFields} \coloneqq *


(the terminal object) and with the field moduli stack being the map
Fields:ℝ→*
  \mathbf{Fields} \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \to *


from (the smooth manifold underlying) the real numbers to the point, or else
Fields:ℂ→*
  \mathbf{Fields} \;\colon\; \mathbb{C} \to *


regarded as an object in H /*≃H\mathbf{H}_{/*} \simeq \mathbf{H}.
Scalar fields are, due to their simplicity, prominent in toy examples used to discuss general properties of quantum field theory. The only fundamental scalar particle observed in nature to date is the Higgs particle (or presumably so, in technicolor models it is not actually fundamental but a composite of fermion particles, discussed below), but the Higgs field is, crucially, charged under the electroweak SU(2)-gauge field. A model of relevance in phenomenology which crucially features an uncharged scalar particle is cosmic inflation. But the fundamental nature of the inflaton field is hypothetical (if it exists at all), it might well be the effective version of non-scalar fields.
Particle trajectory
The dynamics of a particle propagating in a spacetime XX is described by a field on the abstract worldline which is simply a smooth function ℝ→X\mathbb{R} \to X to the target space XX: a trajectory of the particle. The quantum mechanics that describes the dynamics of such a quantum particle is equivalently a 1-dimensional field theory on the worldline, with these maps as its physical fields.
Therefore such wordline sigma-model fields are given by the special case of def.  with trivial background field BgFields≃*\mathbf{BgFields} \simeq * and with Fields:X→*\mathbf{Fields} \;\colon\; X \to *  regarded as an object in H /*≃H\mathbf{H}_{/*} \simeq \mathbf{H}.
Brane trajectory
More generally, the worldvolume fields of any brane sigma-model with target space XX are given as above.
Open string sigma-model

Remark
A D-brane inclusion Q→ι XXQ \stackrel{\iota_X}{\to} X is the target space for an open string with worldsheet ∂Σ↪ι ΣΣ\partial \Sigma \stackrel{\iota_\Sigma}{\hookrightarrow} \Sigma: a field configuration of the open string sigma-model is a map
ϕ:ι Σ→ι X
  \phi \;\colon\; \iota_\Sigma \to \iota_X


in H Δ 1\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^1}, hence a diagram of the form
∂Σ →ϕ bdr Q ↓ ι Σ ⇙ ↓ ι X Σ →ϕ bulk X.
  \array{
    \partial \Sigma &\stackrel{\phi_{bdr}}{\to}& Q
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\iota_\Sigma}} 
     &\swArrow& 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\iota_X}}
    \\
    \Sigma &\stackrel{\phi_{bulk}}{\to}& X
  }
  \,.


For XX and QQ ordinary manifolds just says that a field configuration is a map ϕ bulk:Σ→X\phi_{bulk} \;\colon\; \Sigma \to X subject to the constraint that it takes the boundary of Σ\Sigma to QQ. This means that this is a trajectory of an open string in XX whose endpoints are constrained to sit on the D-brane Q↪XQ \hookrightarrow X.
If however XX is more generally an orbifold, then the homotopy filling the above diagram imposes this constraint only up to orbifold transformations, hence exhibits what in the physics literature are called “orbifold twisted sectors” of open string configurations.


Proposition
The moduli stack [ι Σ,ι X][\iota_\Sigma, \iota_X] of such field configurations is the homotopy pullback
[ι Σ,ι X] → [Σ,X] ↓ ⇙ ↓ [S 1,Q] → [S 1,X].
  \array{
    [\iota_{\Sigma}, \iota_X]
    &\to&
    [\Sigma, X]
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    [S^1, Q]
    &\to&
    [S^1, X]
  }
  \,.


The background gauge field for such a sigma-model is a B-field on XX and a Chan-Paton gauge field on Q↪XQ \hookrightarrow X.
I) Force fields
We discuss examples for the two classes of force fields, which are:


Fields of gravity, G-structure and generalized geometry;


Gauge fields.


I a) Fields of gravity, GG-Structure and generalized geometry
We discuss the example of the field of gravity, below in Gravity, and various closely related types of fields that all encode geometry in some sense, in fact all encode geometry in the sense of G-structure. This most general case we discuss in G-structure – (twisted lift of structure ∞-groups).
General – GG-structure: (twisted) lift of structure ∞\infty-group
Let
A→G^→pG
  A \to \hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{p}}{\to} G


be an ∞-group extension in H\mathbf{H}. Then for g X:X→BGg_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}G a given GG-principal ∞-bundle, a lift of the structure group from GG to G^\hat G is a field
ϕ:g X→Bp.
  \phi \; \colon\; g_X \to \mathbf{B p}
  \,.


If the ∞-group extension is central in that it extends to a homotopy fiber sequence of the form
BA→BG^→BpBG→cB 2A
  \mathbf{B}A \to \mathbf{B}\hat G \stackrel{\mathbf{Bp}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to} \mathbf{B}^2 A


then a twisted c-structure is a map
ϕ:g X→c
  \phi 
   \;\colon\;
  g_X \to \mathbf{c}


in H /BG\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}. These kinds of fields are interpreted as fields of gravity and its variants, as shown by the following examples.
For recognizing traditional constructions in this formulation, the following basic fact is important.

Proposition
For ι:H↪G\iota \colon H \hookrightarrow G an subgroup inclusion of Lie groups, we have a homotopy fiber sequence
G/H→BH→BιBG
  G/H \to \mathbf{B}H \stackrel{\mathbf{B}\iota}{\to} \mathbf{B}G


with the coset space on the left.

Gravity
We discuss the formulation of the field of gravity as a special case of def. .

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, let
Fields:BO(n)→OrthStruc nBGL(n)
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
   \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)


be the delooping of the Lie-subgroup inclusion of the orthogonal group into the general linear group in dimension nn (the inclusion of the maximal compact subgroup).
For X∈X \in  SmoothMfd ↪\hookrightarrow H≔\mathbf{H} \coloneqq Smooth∞Grpd a smooth manifold of dimension nn, write
Φ X≔τ X:X→BGL(n)
  \Phi_X \coloneqq \tau_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n)


for the canonical map modulating the GL(n)GL(n)-principal bundle to which the tangent bundle is canonically associated.


Example
Morphisms
ϕ:τ X→OrthStruc n
  \phi \;\colon\; \tau_X \to \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n


in H /BGL(n)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}GL(n)} hence diagrams
X  →  BO(n)  ↘ ⇙ e ↙   BGL(n)
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}O(n)
    \\
    & \searrow &\swArrow_{e}& \swarrow
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }


in H\mathbf{H} are equivalently vielbein fields ee exhibiting the reduction of the structure group from GL(n)GL(n) to O(n)O(n). A gauge transformation is a local frame transformation. Hence
[τ X,OrthStruc n] H∈H
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}


is the moduli stack of Riemannian metrics on XX. Every such is a field configuration of ordinary gravity on XX. (But see example  below.)
According to remark  such fields pull back along map f:Y→Xf \colon Y \to X that fit into a diagram
Y  →f  X   τ Y↘ ⇙ ≃ ↙ τ X   BGL(n).
  \array{
    Y &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\tau_Y}}\searrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\tau_X}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,.


These are precisely local diffeomorphisms and indeed these are precisely the maps along which vielbein fields / pseudo-Riemannian metric fiedls pull back. (Pullback along smooth functions may not preserve the non-degeneracy of a metric tensor, but precisely the local diffeomorphisms do.)


Remark
The smooth structure on XX as embodied by τ X\tau_X is the background field in example .

the map of moduli stacks BO(n)→BGL(n)\mathbf{B}O(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) becomes an equivalence (a weak homotopy equivalence) of classifying space BO(n)→≃BGL(n)B O(n) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B GL(n).
This means that in plain homotopy theory, hence ignoring the geometry, a lift in
  BO(n)  ↗ ↓ X →τ X BGL(n)
  \array{
    && B O(n)
    \\
    & \nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}& B GL(n)
  }


is no information, up to equivalence: it always exists and exists uniquely up to a contractible space of choices. In order for such a lift really to be equivalently an orthogonal structure it needs to be taken with geometry included, hence for moduli stacks (_cohesive_ homotopy type) as above.
The analog statement is true for every delooping BH→BG\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G of the inclusion H↪GH \hookrightarrow G of a maximal compact subgroup into a Lie group. More examples of this kind we discuss below in Type II Gravity and generalized geometry.


Remark
The homotopy fiber of OrthStruc n\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n is the coset space GL(n)//O(n)GL(n)//O(n), hence we have a homotopy fiber sequence of moduli stacks of the form
GL(n)//O(n)→BO(n)→OrthStruc nBGL(n)
  GL(n)//O(n)
  \to
  \mathbf{B}O(n)
  \stackrel{\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)


in H\mathbf{H}. This means that locally, over a cover (1-epimorphism) p:U→Xp \colon U \to X over which the tangent bundle has a trivialization τ X| U≃*\tau_X|_U \simeq *, the space of fields is simply [U,GL(n)//O(n)][U, GL(n)//O(n)].

The next example is the differential refinement of the previous one.

Example
Let
OrthStruc^ n:BO(n) conn→BGL(n) conn
  \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}


be the canonical differential refinement of OrthStruc n\mathbf{OrthStruc}_n, where now the moduli stacks of principal connections appear. For XX a manifold as above, let then
τ^ X:X→BGL(n) conn
  \hat \tau_X 
  \;\colon\;
  X 
  \to
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}


modulate an affine connection on the tangent bundle. A field
ϕ:τ^ X→OrthStruc^ n
  \phi \;\colon\; \hat \tau_X \to \widehat \mathbf{OrthStruc}_n


is now still equivalently just a vielbein, but its component
∑BGL(n) connτ^ X:X→BO(n) conn
  \underset{\mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn}}{\sum} \hat \tau_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \to \mathbf{B}O(n)_{conn}


now captures the orthognal connection which in the physics literature is often called (inaccurately) the spin connection, denoted ω\omega. The vielbein then exhibits the original affine connection as that whose components are the Christoffel symbols Γ\Gamma of the Riemannian metric defined as above, a relation that is familiar from the physics literature in the form of the equation
ω=e −1Γe+e −1de
  \omega = e^{-1}\Gamma e + e^{-1} d e


between local connection 1-form components.

But both these examples do not fully accurately reflect the field content of gravity yet. This is because the theory of gravity is supposed to by generally covariant. This means that for two vielbein field configurations as in example  such that one goes into the other under a diffeomorphism of spacetime XX, there is a gauge transformation between them.

Example
Write Diff(X)≔Aut(X)∈Grp(H)\mathbf{Diff}(X) \coloneqq \mathbf{Aut}(X) \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) for the diffeomorphism group of the smooth manifold XX. There is then the canonical ∞-action of the automorphism ∞-group Diff(X)\mathbf{Diff}(X) on XX itself, exhibited by the universal associated ∞-bundle
(X//Diff(X)→BDiff(X))∈H /BDiff(X).
  \left(X // \mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right) \right)
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}\left(X\right)}
  \,.


This induces also an ∞-action also on the tangent bundle.
Moreover the trivial bundle
Fields≔(Diff(X)×OrthStruc→BDiff(X))∈H /BDiff(X)
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \coloneqq
  (\mathbf{Diff}(X)\times \mathbf{OrthStruc} \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X) )
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Diff}(X)}


corresponds to the trivial action.
Then
∑BDiff(n)∏B(GL(n))[τ X,Fields]∈H
  \underset{\mathbf{B}Diff(n)}{\sum}
  \underset{\mathbf{B}(GL(n))}{\prod} 
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]
 \in \mathbf{H}


is the accurate space of generally covariant fields of gravity.

SpinSpin-structures
In theories with fermions (discussed below) the field of gravity is more refined than just a vielbein field as above, hence an orthogonal structure on spacetime: it also involves an orientation structure and a spin structure.
To see that these structures are really all (fields) of the same kind, observe that they are the lifts through the first step of the Whitehead tower of BGL\mathbf{B}GL, as shown in the following table

(all hooks are homotopy fiber sequences)

Notice, as in remark , that for the interpretation of the first step here it is crucial to interpret this in moduli ∞-stacks and not in classifying spaces.
Hence if a background field of gravity is assumed, BgFields:BO(n)\mathbf{BgFields} \colon \mathbf{B}O(n), Φ X=e X\Phi_X = e_X, then the moduli stack for orientation structure-fields is
Fields:BSO(n)→BO(n)
  \mathbf{Fields} \colon \mathbf{B} SO(n) \to \mathbf{B}O(n)


in H /BO(n)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}O(n)}. And if an orientation background field is assumed, BgFields:BSO(n)\mathbf{BgFields} \colon \mathbf{B}SO(n), Φ X=o X\Phi_X = o_X, then the moduli stack for spin structure-fields is
Fields:BSpin(n)→BSO(n).
  \mathbf{Fields} \colon \mathbf{B} Spin(n) \to \mathbf{B}SO(n)
  \,.


Evidently there is then also a notion of higher spin structure-fields. These appear as backgrounds when one passes from spinning particles to spinning strings and then to further “spinning” branes. This we discuss below in Higher spin structures.
Spin cSpin^c-structures
Some theories involve not plain spin structures but spin-c structures on their spacetime/worldvolume (for instance in Seiberg-Witten theory or in the gauge theory over D-branes in type II string theory, see the example Chan-Paton gauge fields on D-branes below). By the discussion there, the moduli stack BSpin c(n)\mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) for spin^c group-principal bundles sits in the homotopy pullback diagram
BSpin c → BU(1) ↓  ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2,
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c &\to& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \,mod\, 2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}&
   \mathbf{B}^2\mathbb{Z}_2
  }
 \,,


where the right vertical map represents the universal first Chern class modulo 2. In other words this says that a spin^c-structure on some XX is a twisted w2-structure with twist the first Chern-class of a circle bundle.
So if that circle bundle is regarded as a background field
ϕ X≔g XcolonX→BU(1)
  \phi_X \coloneqq g_X \;colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}U(1)


then a Spin cSpin^c-structure for that underlying circle bundle is a field
ϕ:Φ X→w 2
  \phi 
    \;\colon\;
  \Phi_X \to \mathbf{w}_2


in H /B 2ℤ 2\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2}.
Or rather, if XX is a manifold as before and the SO(n)SO(n)-principal bundle involved in the above is required to be a reduction of the tangent bundle τ X:X→BGL(n)\tau_X : X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) as before, then the background field for Spin cSpin^c-structure fields is
Φ X:X→(τ X,g Xmod2)BGL(n)×B 2ℤ 2,
  \Phi_X 
   \;\colon\;
   X 
   \stackrel{(\tau_X, g_X \,mod\, 2)}{\to}
   \mathbf{B}GL(n) \times \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  \,,


and the field moduli stack is
Fields:BSO(n)→(p,w 2)BGL(n)×B.
  \mathbf{Fields} \;\colon\; 
  \mathbf{B}SO(n)
   \stackrel{(p, \mathbf{w}_2)}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n) \times \mathbf{B}
  \,.


Type II gravity, exceptional geometry
By remark  above the ordinary field of gravity on some manifold XX is equivalently a reduction of the structure group from the general linear group to its maximal compact subgroup, regarded as a field whose background field is the tangent bundle itself.
If one instead considers a variant of the tangent bundle as a background field – a generalized tangent bundle τ X gen:X→BG\tau_X^{gen} : X \to \mathbf{B}G – with some other structure Lie group GG, then a field with values in
Fields:BH→BG
  \mathbf{Fields} 
    \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G


in H /BG\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G} and for H↪H \hookrightarrow the inclusion of the maximal compact subgroup, may be thought of as an accordingly generized field of gravity defining a generalized Riemannian geometry.
Such fields naturally appear in theories of higher-dimensional supergravity, where related to the T-duality and more generally U-duality structure of these theories.
Notably in manifestly T-duality-equivariant type II supergravity the generalized tangent bundle on the nn-dimensional spacetime is an O(n,n)O(n,n)-principal bundle τ X gen:X→BO(n,n)\tau^{gen}_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}O(n,n). The corresponding maximal compact subgroup inclusion yields the moduli stack of fields
Fields:B(O(n)×O(n))→BO(n,n)
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}(O(n)\times O(n))
  \to
  \mathbf{B}O(n,n)


and a field ϕ:τ X gen→Fields\phi \;\colon\; \tau_X^{gen} \to \mathbf{Fields} is equivalently the generalized vielbein for the generalized Riemannian geometry called type II geometry on XX.
In fact also the generalized tangent bundle itself should be regarded as a field: Notice that the canonical diagonal inclusion
GL(n)↪O(n,n)
  GL(n) \hookrightarrow O(n,n)


does not have a retraction. Write GL(n)↪G geom↪O(n,n)GL(n) \hookrightarrow G_{geom} \hookrightarrow O(n,n) for the maximal subgroup for which a retrection to GL(n)GL(n) still exists, called the geometric subgroup in the context of type II geometry. Then a lift of the tangent bundle to G geomG_{geom}
X  →τ X gen  BG geom ↪ BO(n,n)   athllapτ X↘ ⇙ ↙ p   BGL(n),
  \array{
    X &&\stackrel{\tau_X^{gen}}{\to}&& \mathbf{B}G_{geom} & \hookrightarrow& \mathbf{B} O(n,n)
    \\
    & {}_{\athllap{\tau_X}}\searrow &\swArrow& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{p}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}GL(n)
  }
  \,,


hence a field
e X gen:τ X→p
  e_X^{gen} \;\colon\; \tau_X \to \mathbf{p}


is what is called a geoemtric generalized tangent bundle. These are exactly the generalized tangent bundles primarily considered in the literature (see at type II geometry for more).
In the Kaluza-Klein compactification of type II supergravity and of 11-dimensional supergravity preserving some amount of global supersymmetry this generalized type II geometry is further enhanced to various flavors of what is called exceptional generalized geometry.
Here the generalized tangent bundle has as structure group an exceptional Lie group from the EE-series E n(n)E_{n(n)} (for compactification on an nn-dimensional compact space). The moduli stack of fields is then
Fields:BK n→BE n(n)
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B} K_{n}
  \to 
  \mathbf{B} E_{n(n)}


and a field e X gen:τ X gen→Fields e_X^{gen} \;\colon\; \tau_X^{gen} \to \mathbf{Fields} is equivalently a generalized vielbein for exceptional generalized geometry.
Higher spin structures
By the discussion of Spin structure fields above there are evident higher analogs, obtained by climbing through the Whitehead tower of BO.
In the next step we have String structure-fields which are maps to
Fields:BString→BSpin.
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}String \to \mathbf{B}Spin
  \,.


These appear as fields in heterotic supergravity with quantum anomaly-cancellation by the Green-Schwarz mechanism and for trivial gauge field. In the presence of a non-trivial gauge field these are further refined to Higher spin-c structrures discussed below. This field content of heterotic supergravity is discussed in more detail below in Anomaly-free heterotic supergravity fields – differential String-c structures.
Further up the Whitehead tower Fivebrane structure-fields are maps to
Fields:BFivebrane→BString
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}Fivebrane \to \mathbf{B}String


in H /BString\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}String}. These, or their twisted variants, appear in dual heterotic string theory.
Higher Spin cSpin^c-structures
As discussed above, an ordinary spin-c structure is really a spin structure which is twisted by the class of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle.
Similarly the higher spin structure-fields just discussed have further twistes by background unitary bundles. For
c:BG→B 3U(1)
  \mathbf{c} \;\colon\; \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)


some universal characteristic map on moduli ∞-stacks, for B 3U(1)\mathbf{B}^3 U(1) the moduli 3-stack of circle 3-bundles, hence circle 3-group-principal ∞-bundles we say that the smooth ∞-group String cString^{\mathbf{c}} appearing in the homotopy pullback diagram
BString c → BG ↓  ↓ c BSpin →12p B 3U(1)
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}String^{\mathbf{c}}
    &\to&
    \mathbf{B} G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}Spin &\stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}}{\to}&
    \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }


is a higher string 2-group-analog of spin^c.
In particular, if GG is a compact, connected and simply connected simple Lie group (such as the spin group or the special unitary group) then
π 0H(BG,B 3U(1))≃H 4(BG,ℤ)≃ℤ
  \pi_0\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)) 
  \simeq
  H^4(BG, \mathbb{Z}) 
  \simeq 
  \mathbb{Z}


(the first equivalence is discussed at Lie group cohomology as a special case of a theorem discussed at smooth infinity-groupoid). This means that there is an essentially unique map of higher moduli stacks
c:BG→B 3U(1)
  \mathbf{c}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}G
  \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)


which maps to the generator of H 4(BG,ℤ)H^4(BG, \mathbb{Z}) under geometric realization of cohesive infinity-groupoids. For G=SpinG = Spin this is the smooth refinement of the first fractional Pontryagin class 12p 1\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1, discussed further at twisted differential string structure.
Of interest in heterotic supergravity here is the case that G=E 8×E 8G = E_8 \times E_8 (the product of the exceptional Lie group E 8E_8 with itself) and c\mathbf{c} is twice the canonical string class.
If then g X:X→B(E 8×E 8)g_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}(E_8 \times E_8) is the instanton sector of the gauge field in heterotic supergravity regarded as a background gauge field for the field of heterotic gravity, then with
Fields:BSpin→12p 1B 3U(1)
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}Spin \stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1}{\to} \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)


a map
g X→Fields
  g_X \to \mathbf{Fields}


in H /B 3U(1)\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)} is a String c\mathbf{String}^{\mathbf{c}}-structure on XX whose underlying gage bundle is the given Φ X\Phi_X.
As before for Spin cSpin^c-structures, in applications one in addition demands that this String c\mathbf{String}^{\mathbf{c}}-structure is indeed a refinement of the field of gravity of the theory, which means that one takes the background field to be
Φ X:X→(τ X,g X)BGL(n)×B(E 8×E 8)
  \Phi_X
  \;\colon\;
  X
  \stackrel{(\tau_X, g_X)}{\to} \mathbf{B}GL(n) \times \mathbf{B}(E_8 \times E_8)


and the moduli ∞\infty-stack of fields to be
Fields:BSpin(n)→(p,12p 1)BGL(n)×B 3U(1).
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}Spin(n)
  \stackrel{(p, \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1)}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n) \times \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  \,.


These are precisely the instanton sectors of the fields of Green-Schwarz anomaly free heterotic supergravity, discussed further below in Anomaly-free heterotic supergravity fields. (SSS)
I b) Gauge fields
General – Coefficients in differential cohomology: ∞\infty-connections
The term gauge field in gauge theory with respect to a gauge group GG refers to fields which are modeled by connections either on GG-principal bundles or on associated bundles for these. The notion of equivalence between two such fields (hence between connections on bundles) is the original meaning of the word gauge transformation, even though that term is also used for equivalences between fields which are not modeled by connections.
We discuss the general notion of gauge fields and then various special cases and variants. The following table gives an overview over the notions involved in the concept of gauge fields

Electromagnetic field
A field configuratiotion of the electromagnetic field is a circle bundle with connection and a gauge transformation of the EM field is an equivalence of such connections.
Let therefore
BU(1) conn≔Ω 1//U(1)≃DK(U(1)→dlogΩ 1)
  \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}
  \coloneqq
  \Omega^1//U(1)
  \simeq
  DK(U(1) \stackrel{d log}{\to} \Omega^1)


be the quotient stack of the action of U(1)U(1) on the sheaf of differential 1-forms, equivalently the image under the Dold-Kan correspondence of the sheaf of chain complexes given by the Deligne complex for degree-2 ordinary differential cohomology, as indicated.
This is the moduli stack for U(1)U(1)-principal connections. Hence setting BgFields≃*\mathbf{BgFields} \simeq * and
Fields≔BU(1) conn
  \mathbf{Fields} \coloneqq \mathbf{B}U(1)_{conn}


in def.  yields the type of the electromagnetic field.
Yang-Mills field
More generally, let GG be a Lie group, and 𝔤\mathfrak{g} its Lie algebra. Write Ω 1(−,𝔤)\Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g}) the sheaf of Lie algebra valued 1-forms

Definition
The moduli stack of GG-principal connections is the quotient stack
BG conn≔Ω 1(−,𝔤)//G
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \coloneqq
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//G


of the action of GG on it Lie algebra valued differential forms by gauge transformations
g:A g≔↦A gAd gA+g *θ.
  g \colon A^g \coloneqq \mapsto A^g Ad_g A + g^* \theta 
  \,.


This is the moduli stack of the GG-Yang-Mills field. Hence setting BgFields≃*\mathbf{BgFields} \simeq * and
Fields≔BG conn
  \mathbf{Fields} \coloneqq \mathbf{B}G_{conn}


in def.  yields Yang-Mills fields.
Kalb-Ramond BB-field
Let
B 2U(1) conn≔Ω 2≤•≤1//BU(1)≃DK(U(1)→dlogΩ 1→dΩ 2)
  \mathbf{B^2}U(1)_{conn}
  \coloneqq
  \Omega^{2 \leq \bullet \leq 1} // \mathbf{B}U(1)
  \simeq
  DK(U(1) \stackrel{d log}{\to} \Omega^1 \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^2)


be the image under the Dold-Kan correspondence of the Deligne complex for degree-3 ordinary differential cohomology. This is the moduli 2-stack for circle 2-bundle with connections.
Setting BgFields≃*\mathbf{BgFields} \simeq * and
Fields≔B 2U(1) conn
  \mathbf{Fields} \coloneqq \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}


in def.  yields the 2-form gauge field known as the B-field or the Kalb-Ramond field.
Supergeometric BB-field
The B-field appears both in bosonic string theory as well as in type II superstring theory. In (Distler-Freed-Moore) it was pointed out that for the superstring the plain formulation above needs to be refined. We discuss here the natural formulation of this observation in higher supergeometry as in (FSS CSIntroAndSurvey, section 4.3).
Generally instead of the circle group U(1)U(1) one can consider the multiplicative group ℂ ×\mathbb{C}^\times of non-zero complex numbers. The canonical subgroup inclusion U(1)↪ℂ ×U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^\times induces for each n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} a canonical morphism of moduli ∞-stacks
B nU(1)→B nℂ ×.
  \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{C}^\times
  \,.


This is not quite an equivalence of ∞-stacks but it is a shape modality-equivalence in that geometric realization of cohesive ∞-groupoids sends it to an equivalence as
|B nU(1)|≃|B nℂ ×|≃K(ℤ,n+1).
  {\vert \mathbf{B}^n U(1)\vert}
  \simeq
  {\vert \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{C}^\times\vert}
  \simeq
  K(\mathbb{Z}, n+1)
  \,.


For instance smooth U(1)U(1)-principal bundles and ℂ ×\mathbb{C}^\times-principal bundles are both classified by the universal Chern class in H 2(−,ℤ)H^2(-, \mathbb{Z}) but the gauge automorphisms of the trivial U(1)U(1)-principal bundle form C ∞(−,U(1))C^\infty(-,U(1)), while that of the trivial ℂ ×\mathbb{C}^\times-principal bundle form the larger C ∞(−,ℂ ×)C^\infty(-,\mathbb{C}^\times).
Both versions of the moduli nn-stack of nn-bundles have their use. The version B nℂ ×\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{C}^\times has the advantage that it is actually equivalent to the moduli nn-stack of complex line nn-bundles.
B nℂ ×≃nLine ℂ.
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{C}^\times \simeq n Line_\mathbb{C}
  \,.


Specifically for n=2n = 2 it is equivalent to the moduli 2-stack of line 2-bundles
B 2ℂ ×≃2Line ℂ.
  \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{C}^\times \simeq 2 Line_\mathbb{C}
  \,.


But now in supergeometry complex super-line 2-bundle have a richer classification that plain line 2-bundle. Explicitly, let now H:\mathbf{H} \colon  SmoothSuper∞Grpd be the ambient cohesive (∞,1)-topos for higher supergeometry and write
2sLine ℂ∈H
  2\mathbf{sLine}_{\mathbb{C}}
  \in 
  \mathbf{H}


for the 2-stack of complex super-line 2-bundle.
This has homotopy sheaves
kkπ k(2sLine)\pi_k( 2 \mathbf{sLine})0ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2
1ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2
3ℂ ×\mathbb{C}^\times

in the topos over supermanifolds. The π 0(2sLine)≃ℤ 2\pi_0(2 \mathbf{sLine}) \simeq \mathbb{Z}_2 says that locally there is not just one super line 2-bundle, namely the standard line 2-bundle, but also its odd “superpartner”.
Under geometric realization |−|:H→∞Grpd≃L wheTop{\vert-\vert} \;\colon\; \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd \simeq L_{whe} Top we have the homotopy type |2sLine|{\vert 2 \mathbf{sLine}\vert} with homotopy groups
kkπ k(|2sLine|)\pi_k({\vert 2 \mathbf{sLine}\vert})0ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2
1ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2
300
4ℤ\mathbb{Z}

Since 2sLine2 \mathbf{sLine} is the Picard 3-group of the monoidal 2-stack 2sVect2 \mathbf{sVect} of super 2-vector bundles it is a supergeometric 3-group. Therefore there is the further delooping B2sLine\mathbf{B}2\mathbf{sLine} and hence the differential refinement 2sLine conn2\mathbf{sLine}_{conn} in the (∞,1)-pullback diagram
2sLine conn → Ω cl 3 ↓  ↓ 2sLine →curv ♭ dRB2sLine.
  \array{
    2\mathbf{sLine}_{conn} &\to& \Omega^3_{cl}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    2 \mathbf{sLine} &\stackrel{curv}{\to}& \flat_{dR} \mathbf{B}2 \mathbf{sLine}
  }
  \,.


This is now the moduli 2-stack
Fields≔22Line conn∈SmoothSuper∞Grpd
  \mathbf{Fields} \coloneqq 2\mathbf{2Line}_{conn}
  \;\;
  \in SmoothSuper\infty Grpd


for the B-field in type II string theory.
Supergravity CC-field
Proceeding in this fashion, let
B 3U(1) conn≔Ω 3≤•≤1//B 2U(1)≃DK(U(1)→dlogΩ 1→dΩ 2→dΩ 3)

are one component of the supergravity C-field.
II) Matter fields
Fundamental matter-fields as they appear in the standard model of particle physics, hence fundamental fermions such as electrons, quarks and neutrinos, are sections of a GG-associated bundle E→XE \to X on spacetime, where GG is the gauge group of the force fields that interact with the matter fields and where E→XE \to X is associated to the principal bundle underlying such a force gauge field, as discussed in Gauge fields above, and, if we are talking indeed about fermions, to the spin bundle given by the gravity-spin structure field discussed in Gravity and generalized geometry above.
More precisely, fermioninc matter fields are sections of these bundles regarded in supergeometry with the fibers regarded as odd-graded. (…)
General – sections of associated fiber ∞\infty-bundles
We start by discussing the general mechanism by which sections of ρ\rho-associated ∞-bundles are an example of the general definition .
For G∈Grp(H)G \in \Grp(\mathbf{H}) a geometric ∞-group, there is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
GAct≃H /BG
  G Act \simeq \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}


between that of ∞-actions of GG and the slice (∞,1)-topos of H\mathbf{H} over the delooping BG\mathbf{B}G of GG. Under this equivalence an ∞-action/∞-representation of GG on some V∈HV \in \mathbf{H} is equivalently a homotopy fiber sequence of the form
V → V//G   ↓ ρ¯   BG
  \array{
    V &\to& V//G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\overline \rho}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }


in H\mathbf{H}. This is the universal rho-associated ∞-bundle: for P→XP \to X any GG-principal ∞-bundle with modulating map g X:X→BGg_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}G the corresponding associated VV-fiber ∞-bundle is naturally equivalent to the (∞,1)-pullback of ρ¯\overline{\rho} along gg:
P× GV≃g X *(ρ¯).
  P \times_G V \simeq g_X^*(\overline{\rho})
  \,.


From this and the universal property of the (∞,1)-pullback one finds that a section of the associated ∞-bundle P× GV→XP \times_G V \to X is equivalently a map
ϕ:g X→ρ¯
  \phi : g_X \to \overline{\rho}


in H /BG\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}.
This means that such sections are fields in the sense of def.  where


BgFields≃BG\mathbf{BgFields} \simeq \mathbf{B}G;


the background field is the moduli g Xg_X;


the moduli ∞-stack of fields is ρ¯∈H /BG\overline{\rho} \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}.

Tensor fields
While the term physical field probably orignates from tensor field, few fields are fundamentally given by tensor fields. Nevertheless, tensor fields, being sections of a tensor product of copies of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle are certainly examples of the general notion of field as in def. . Gere we spell this out.
For XX a smooth manifold, a tensor field of rank (p,q)(p,q) is a section of the tensor product bundle
Γ(TX) ⊗ C ∞(X)p⊗ C ∞(X)Γ(T *X) ⊗q.
  \Gamma(T X)^{\otimes_{C^\infty(X)} p} \otimes_{C^\infty(X)} \Gamma(T^* X)^{\otimes q}
  \,. 


This is canonically the associated bundle to the GL(n)GL(n)-principal bundle which to which the tangent bundle is also canonically associated, by the given representation of GL(n)GL(n) on ℝ n(p+q)\mathbb{R}^{n(p+q)}.
The universal associated ∞-bundle of this representation is
Fields:ℝ n(p+q)//GL(n)→BGL(n)\mathbf{Fields} 
\;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n (p+q)}//GL(n) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) .
Hence for τ X:X→BGL(n)\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) the canonical map, the space of (p,q)(p,q)-tensor fields on XX is
[τ X,Fields] H∈H.
  [\tau_X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}
  \in
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


By passing to irreducible representations in the above, we obtain specifically the corresponding subclasses of tensor fields, such as differential forms.
Fields combining these properties
The above distinction of types of physical fields into into Sigma-model fields, Force fields of gravity, Gauge force fields and Matter fields can be helpful for reasoning about fields and types of theories in physics, but is not fundamental. The general definition  of which all these types are examples reflects that. In fact, one way to read that definition and the above list of examples is to say that it shows that in higher geometry all types of fields are sigma-model fields: they are all given as maps Φ X→Fields\Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields} from a domain spacetime/worldvolume+background field Φ X\Phi_X to a generalized target space Fields\mathbf{Fields} (the moduli ∞-stack of fields in the given slice (∞,1)-topos characterized by the nature of the background fields).
Accordingly, a general physical field in a general theory does not fall squarely into one of the above categories, but combines aspects of all of these. Here we discuss such examples.
General – Twisted differential-cocycles and -c\mathbf{c}-structures
We have seen that the moduli ∞-stack of a field of plain gravity or general geometry is a map c:BG^→BG\mathbf{c} \colon \mathbf{B}\hat G \to \mathbf{B}G of moduli ∞-stack of principal ∞-bundles, regarded as an object in the slice H /BG\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}, and that the moduli ∞-stack of a plain GG-gauge field is that of principal ∞-connections BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn}. These two concepts have an evident unification if c\mathbf{c} has a differential refinement atc\at \mathbf{c} to a map of differential moduli stacks
BG^ conn →c^ BG conn ↓  ↓ BG^ →c BG,  
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\hat G_{conn} &\stackrel{\hat \mathbf{c}}{\to}&
   \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{B}\hat G &\stackrel{\mathbf{c}}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,,


regarded then as an object in the slice H /BG conn\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G_{conn}}.
Since, as discussed above, a field with coefficients in c\mathbf{c} is equivalently a twisted c\mathbf{c}-structure, we may calla field with coefficients in c^\hat \mathbf{c} a twisted differential c-structure.
Moreover, we have seen that matter fields have moduli ∞-stacks coming not from a direct delooping BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq *//G of an ∞-group GG, but from the homotopy quotient V//GV//G of an ∞-action of GG on some object VV. Combining this with differential refinement as above we consider fields whose moduli ∞-stacks are maps
(V//G) conn→c^(BG) conn∈H /BG conn.
  (V//G)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\hat \mathbf{c}}{\to}
  (\mathbf{B}G)_{conn}
  \;\;\;\;
  \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G_{conn}}
  \,.


This is a differential refinement of fields which are cocycles in twisted cohomology with local coefficients VV, hence twisted differential cohomology. The above case of twisted differential c-structures is a special case of this for V≃BAV \simeq \mathbf{B}A the delooping of the ∞-group that extended GG to G^\hat G.
Some further slight variants of these combinations appear in the examples below.
Nonabelian charged particle trajectories – Wilson line
We describe here a variant of the particle propagating on a spacetime XX, where now the particle is charged under a background gauge field for a nonabelian gauge group GG.
Let GG be a simple Lie group which is connected, simply connected and compact.
Let ρ\rho be an irreducible unitary representation of GG under which the particle is to be charged. By the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem this corresponds equivalently to a weight
⟨λ,−⟩∈𝔤 *.
  \langle \lambda, -\rangle
  \in
  \mathfrak{g}^*
  \,.


Let T≃G λ↪GT \simeq G_\lambda \hookrightarrow G be the maximal torus which is the stabilizer subgroup that fixes this weight under the coadjoint action of GG on its dual Lie algebra 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*.
Set then in def.  the moduli stack of background fields to be
BgField:Ω 1(−,𝔤)//G≃BG connH
  \mathbf{BgField} \colon \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//G \simeq \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \;\;\;
  \mathbf{H}


as in def. . Moreover, let the moduli ∞\infty-stack of fields in H /BG conn\mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G_{conn}} be given by the canonical map
Fields:Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T→Ω 1(−,𝔤)//G≃BG conn
  \mathbf{Fields} 
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
  \to 
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//G
  \simeq
   \mathbf{B}G_{conn}


which is induced by the defining inclusion of TT.

Remark
For U∈U \in CartSp ↪H\hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} a field ϕ:U→Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T\phi \colon U \to \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T is equivalently a Lie algebra valued form A∈Ω 1(U,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(U,\mathfrak{g}), but a gauge transformation of such a field is constrained to be a smooth TT-valued function t∈C ∞(U,T)↪C ∞(U,G)t \in C^\infty(U,T) \hookrightarrow C^\infty(U, G) instead of an arbitrary GG-valued function.


Remark
With these definitions we have for XX a manifold that


a background gauge field Φ X:X→BG conn\Phi_X \;\colon\; X \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn} is equivalently a GG-principal connection on XX (which if GG is assumed connected and simply connected and Σ\Sigma is of dimension at most 3 is equivalently just a Lie algebra valued form);


a field configuration is a diagram in H\mathbf{H} of the form
X  →∇ g  Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T   ∇↘ ⇙ g ↙ Fields   BG conn,
  \array{  
    X &&\stackrel{\nabla^g}{\to}&& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
    \\
    & {}_{\nabla}\searrow &\swArrow_{g}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{Fields}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  }
  \,,


which is equivalently a differentially refined reduction of the structure group of the GG-principal bundle underlying ∇\nabla. If ∇\nabla is given by a globally defined connection form AA then this is equivalently just a smooth GG-valued function gg on XX that takes AA to A gA^g as indicated.



As a slight variant of prop.  we have

Proposition
We have a homotopy fiber sequence
𝒪 λ≃G/T→Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T→FieldsBG conn,
  \mathcal{O}_\lambda \simeq G/T \to \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
  \stackrel{\mathbf{Fields}}{\to} \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \,,


where on the left we have the coadjoint orbit of ⟨λ,−⟩\langle \lambda , -\rangle.


Remark
This implies that if ∇=0\nabla = 0 is the trivial background field, than fields ϕ:X→Fields\phi : X \to \mathbf{Fields} are equivalently maps to the coadjoint orbit
[X,Fields] H| Φ X=0≃C ∞(X,𝒪 λ).
  [X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}}|_{\Phi_X = 0}
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X, \mathcal{O}_\lambda)
  \,.


Hence in this sector we have simply a sigma-model field as in Sigma-models above.


Remark
There is a canonical extended Lagrangian on [X,Fields] H[X, \mathbf{Fields}]_{\mathbf{H}} with the above definitions, whose action functional, if X=S 1X = S^1 is the closed connected 1-dimensional manifold, is that of a 1d Chern-Simons theory. The partition function of the corresponding quantum field theory is the holonomy map – the “Wilson line” – on the background gauge field connection ∇\nabla.

This is discussed further at geometry of physics – Prequantum gauge theory and gravity.
3d Chern-Simons field with Wilson line
We discuss the field content of 3d Chern-Simons theory for a simple, simply connected compact Lie group with Wilson loops. This is an example of Bulk fields with defect fields.
Let Σ 3∈SmthMfd↪H\Sigma_3 \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} be a smooth manifold of dimension 3, and let
C X:S 1→Σ 3
  C_X \;\colon\; S^1 \to \Sigma^3


be the embedding of a knot. Let the moduli of fields be
Fields:Ω 1(−,𝔠)//T→BG conn
  \mathbf{Fields}
  : 
  \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{c})//T \to \mathbf{B}G_{conn}


as defined in Nonabelian charged particle trajectories – Wilson lines above. Regarding the not inclusion as a defect in the 3-dimnensional manifold, a bulk-defect fiedl configuration according to def.  is a map
ϕ:C X→Fields
  \phi 
   \;\colon\;
   C_X \to \mathbf{Fields}


in H (Δ 1)\mathbf{H}^{(\Delta^1)}. This is equivalently a diagram
S 1 →A| S 1 g Ω 1(−,𝔤)//T ↓ C ⇙ g ↓ Σ 3 →A BG conn
  \array{
    S^1 &\stackrel{A|_{S^1}^g}{\to}& \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})//T
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{C}} &\swArrow_{g}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Sigma_3 &\stackrel{A}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  }


in H\mathbf{H}. This in turn is equivalently


a Lie algebra valued form A∈Ω 1(Σ 3,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(\Sigma_3, \mathfrak{g}) (the bulk gauge field of GG-Chern-Simons theory)


a gg-valued function on the circle g∈C ∞(S 1,G)g \in C^\infty(S^1, G)


which determine a background gauge field A| S 1 gA|_{S^1}^g on the knot.
Moreover a gauge transformation between two such field configurations κ:ϕ⇒ϕ′\kappa \;\colon\; \phi \Rightarrow \phi' is equivalently a gauge transformaiton of AA and of A| S 1A|_{S^1} such that together they intertwine gg and g′g'. In particular if the bulk field is held fixed, then such a gauge transformation is a function t:S 1→Tt \colon S^1 \to T such that g′=tgg' = t g. This means that the gauge equivalence classes of field confiurations for fixed background gauge field are labeled by maps to the coadjoint orbit 𝒪 λ≃G/T\mathcal{O}_\lambda \simeq G/T as above.
This are the field confugurations for 3d Chern-Simons theory (see the discussion there) with Wilson lines (FSS).
Chan-Paton gauge fields on D-branes: twisted differential K-cocycles
We discuss the Chan-Paton gauge fields over D-branes in type II string theory.
The extension of groups U(1)→U(n)→PU(n)U(1) \to U(n) \to PU(n) sits in a long homotopy fiber sequence of ∞\infty-stacks
U(1)→U(n)→PU(n)→BU(1)→BU(n)→BPU(n)→dd nB 2U(1)
  U(1) \to U(n) \to PU(n) \to \mathbf{B}U(1)
  \to \mathbf{B}U(n) \to \mathbf{B}PU(n) \stackrel{\mathbf{dd}_n}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)


Let
Fields:(BU(n)//BU(1)) conn→B 2U(1) conn
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \colon
  (\mathbf{B}U(n)//\mathbf{B}U(1))_{conn}
  \to
  \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}


be the differential refinement of that universal Dixmier-Douady class.
Let
ι X:Q↪X
  \iota_X   
    \;\colon\;
  Q \hookrightarrow X 


be a submanifold, to be thought of as a D-brane worldvolume in an ambient spacetime XX.
Then a field configuration of the B-field on XX together with a compatible rank-nn gauge field on the D-brane is a map
ι X→Fields
  \iota_X \to \mathbf{Fields}


in H (Δ 1)\mathbf{H}^{(\Delta^1)}, hence a diagram in H\mathbf{H} of the form
Q → (BU(n)//BU(1))  ι X↓ ⇙ ≃ ↓ dd^ n X →∇ B B 2U(1) conn
  \array{
    Q &\stackrel{}{\to}& (\mathbf{B}U(n)//\mathbf{B}U(1))
    \\
    {}^{\iota_X}\downarrow &\swArrow_{\simeq}& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\hat \mathbf{dd}_n}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\nabla_B}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
  }


This identifies a twisted bundle with connection on the D-brane whose twist is the class in H 3(X,ℤ)H^3(X, \mathbb{Z}) of the bulk B-field.
This relation is the Kapustin-part of the Freed-Witten-Kapustin anomaly cancellation for the bosonic string or else for the type II string on Spin cSpin^c D-branes. (FSS)

Remark
If we regard the B-field as a background field for the Chan-Paton gauge field, then remark  determines along which maps of the B-field the Chan-Paton gauge field may be transformed.
Y → X → (BU(n)//BU(1)) conn  ↘ ↓ ↙   B 2U(1) conn.
  \array{
    Y &\stackrel{}{\to}& X &\stackrel{}{\to}& (\mathbf{B}U(n)//\mathbf{B}U(1))_{conn}
    \\
    & \searrow & \downarrow & \swarrow
    \\
    &&\mathbf{B}^2 U(1)_{conn}
  }
  \,.


On the local connection forms this acts as
A↦A+α.
  A \mapsto A + \alpha
  \,.

B↦B+dα
  B \mapsto B + d \alpha


This is the famous gauge transformation law known from the string theory literature.

Anomaly-free heterotic string background: differential String cString^c-structure
Let
Fields:BSpin conn→12p^ 1B 3U(1) conn
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}Spin_{conn}
  \stackrel{\tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}


Let
Φ X:X→g XB(E 8×E 8) conn→c^ 2B 3U(1)
  \Phi_X \;\colon\; X \stackrel{g_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}(E_8 \times E_8)_{conn}
  \stackrel{\hat \mathbf{c}_2}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)


then fields are twisted differential string structures or equivalently differential String c\mathbf{String}^{\mathbf{c}}-structure with underlying gauge bundle give by Φ X\Phi_X, the differential refinement of the discussion in Higher spin structure above.
As in the discussion there, we implement the constraint that the string structure is on the tangent bundle τ XcololX→BGL(n)\tau_X \;\colol\; X \to \mathbf{B}GL(n) of the manifold by settting
Fields:BSpin conn→(p,12p^ 1)BGL(n) connB 3U(1) conn
  \mathbf{Fields}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}Spin_{conn}
  \stackrel{(p,\tfrac{1}{2}\hat \mathbf{p}_1)}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_conn \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}


and
Φ X:X→(∇ X,c^ 2(g X))BGL(n) conn×B 3U(1) conn.
  \Phi_X
  \;\colon\;
  X
  \stackrel{(\nabla_X, \hat \mathbf{c}_2(g_X))}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}GL(n)_{conn} \times \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


Then a field ϕ:Φ X→Fields\phi \;\colon\; \Phi_X \to \mathbf{Fields} is the higher spin-connection version as discussed in Gravity above of a twisted differential string structure.
The moduli stack of these fields is that of background fields that satisfy the Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation in heterotic supergravity. (SSS).
For a classical mechanical system, the laws of motion can be expressed in terms of an action principle: the actual paths must be the (locally) extremal paths of the action functional.
In one of the formulations of the classical mechanics, called Lagrangean formalism, every mechanical system is characterized by its configuration space and a single function called Lagrangian which determines the laws of motion (the initial configuration should be given independently).
The Lagrangian, Lagrangian function or Lagrangean L=L(q,q⋅,t)L = L(q,\stackrel{\cdot}q,t) is a real valued function of the points in configuration space and their time derivatives (for some sytems also depending on time), such that the corresponding action principle can be expressed as Euler-Lagrange equations: for all ii,
ddt(∂L∂q⋅ i)−∂L∂q i=0
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel{\cdot}{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i}  = 0


Here q=(q 1,…,q n)q = (q_1,\ldots, q_n) is the coordinate in the configuration space.
For continuum systems satisfying reasonable locality, Lagrangians can be expressed in terms of integrating a local quantity, so-called Lagrangian density.
For XX a (spacetime/worldvolume) smooth manifold of dimension nn, let E→XE \to X be a vector bundle, to serve as the field bundle for the nn-dimensional field theory Lagrangian to be defined.
Denote the jet bundle by j ∞E→Xj_\infty E \to X and write Ω •,•(j ∞E)\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(j_\infty E) be the corresponding variational bicomplex.

Definition
A local Lagrangian on fields given by the field bundle E→XE \to X is given by an element
L∈Ω n,0(j ∞E),
  L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)
  \,,


hence a horizontal differential form of degree nn on the jet bundle of EE.
The local Lagrangian itself is the pullback of this along the jet prolongation map j ∞:Γ X(E)⟶Γ(j ∞E)j_\infty \colon \Gamma_X(E) \longrightarrow \Gamma(j_\infty E), hence the differential form-valued functional on the space of sections of EE given by
L:(ϕ∈Γ(E))↦L(j ∞ϕ)∈Ω n(X).
  L : (\phi \in \Gamma(E)) \mapsto L(j_\infty \phi) \in \Omega^n(X)
  \,.


The integral (for compact XX)
∫ XL(j ∞(−)):Γ(E)⟶ℝ
  \int_X L(j_\infty(-)) \;\colon\; 
  \Gamma(E) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}


is the corresponding local action functional.

A state of a system in physics is a description of everything that is true (or known, or relevant, depending on the circumstances) about the physical system.
In the Bayesian interpretation of physics, the state of a system is not a property of reality but instead indicates an observer's knowledge about the system. A pure state gives maximal information about the system (which amounts to complete information in classical mechanics but not generally in quantum mechanics), while a mixed state is more general. A mixed state can be decomposed into a probability distribution on the space of pure states, although this decomposition is unique only for classical systems. In a frequentist interpretation of probability, a mixed state can describe only a statistical ensemble of systems; the real world is in one (generally unknown) pure state (possibly with additional hidden variables in the quantum case, depending on the interpretation of quantum physics).
States in the Schrödinger picture describe the state of the system at any given time and are subject to time evolution?, while in the Heisenberg picture a single state describes the entire history of the system (with time evolution applying to the observables instead).
In statistical physics, a microstate? is a complete description of all of the particles in a system, while a macrostate? considers only the macroscopic properties known to thermodynamics.
In physics the dynamics of a physical system may be encoded by a nonlinear functional – called the action functional – on its configuration space:


in classical mechanics and classical field theory – by the action principle or principle of least action – the extrema of the action functional – obtained by variational calculus and given by Euler-Lagrange equations – encode the physically observable configurations ;


in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the evolution of the quantum states is encoded by the integral – the path integral – of the exponentiated action functional over the space of field configurations.


For emphasis the description of dynamics by action functionals is called the Lagrangean approach. Another formulation of dynamics in physics that does not involve an action functional explicitly is Hamiltonian mechanics on phase space. At least in certain classes of cases the relation and equivalence of both approaches is understood. Generally the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of action functionals suffers from a lack of precise understanding of what the path integral over the action functional really means.



Taken from A Zee, Fearful Symmetry


Let H\mathbf{H} be the ambient (∞,1)-topos with a natural numbers object and equipped with an additive continuum line object 𝔸 1\mathbb{A}^1 (see there). Let C∈HC \in \mathbf{H} be the configuration space of a physical system. Then an action functional is a morphism
exp(iℏS(−)):C→𝔸 1/ℤ
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 / \mathbb{Z}
  \,


(here ℏ\hbar refers to Planck's constant).
If H\mathbf{H} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then there is an intrinsic differential of the action functional to a morphism
dexp(iℏS(−)):C→♭ dR𝔸 1/ℤ.
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


The equation
dexp(iℏS(−))=0  
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) = 0


is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the system. It characterizes the critical locus of SS is the covariant phase space inside the configuration space: the space of classically realized trajectories/histories of the system. If H\mathbf{H} models derived geometry then this critical locus is presented by a BRST-BV complex.
Local action functionals (traditional theory)
An action functional is called local if it arises from integration of a Lagrangian.
In traditional theory this is interpreted as follows: an action functional S:C→𝔸 1S : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 is called local if


the configuration space CC is the space C=Γ X(E)C = \Gamma_X(E) of sections of a fiber bundle E→XE \to X over some parameter space (spacetime XX);


there is a Lagrangian density J ∞(E)→Ω dimX(X)J_\infty(E) \to \Omega^{\dim X}(X) on the jet bundle of EE;


on a section/field configuration ϕ:X→E\phi : X \to E the action SS takes the value
S(ϕ)=∫ XL(j ∞(ϕ)),
  S(\phi) = \int_X L(j_\infty(\phi))
  \,,


where j ∞(ϕ)=(ϕ,∂ iϕ,⋯)j_\infty(\phi) = (\phi, \partial_i \phi, \cdots) is the jet-prolongation of ϕ\phi (the collection of all its higher partial derivatives).


Consider action functional for on a configuration space of smooth functions from the line to a smooth manifold XX.
We can consider

S(q)=∫ a bL(q,q˙)dt S(q) = \int_a^b L(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}t , where qq is a path through configuration space, on the time interval [a,b][a,b], with derivative q˙=dq/dt\dot{q} = \mathrm{d}q/\mathrm{d}t. When minimising the action, we fix the values of q(a)q(a) and q(b)q(b).
L(q,q˙)=∫ Sℒ(q,q˙)dxdydz L(q,\dot{q}) = \int_{S} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z , where now qq is a configuration of fields on SS, which is a region of space. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of SS (typically that qq and q˙\dot{q} go to zero if SS is all of space).
S(q)=∫ Rℒ(q,q˙)dxdydzdt S(q) = \int_{R} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t , where now qq is a configuration of fields on RR, which a region of spacetime, with time derivative q˙=∂q/∂t\dot{q} = \partial{q}/\partial{t}. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of RR.

The formulation of (3) above is still not manifestly coordinate independent. However, dxdydzdt\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t is simply the volume form on spacetime and q˙\dot{q} is merely one choice of coordinate on state space and could just as easily be replaced by a derivative with respect to any timelike coordinate on spacetime (or drop coordinates altogether).
Extended local action functionals in (higher) gauge theory
For gauge theories and higher gauge theories the configuration spaces of the physical system are in general not plain manifolds or similar, but are orbifolds or more generally smooth groupoids, smooth ∞-groupoids. (An exposition of and introduction to much of the following is at geometry of physics.)
For instance for GG a Lie group and BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} the smooth moduli stack of GG-principal connections (see at connection on a bundle), then the smooth groupoid of GG-gauge field configurations is the internal hom/mapping stack [Σ,BG conn]∈[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \in Smooth∞Grpd (or some concretification thereof, see at geometric of physics – differential moduli: this is the smooth groupoid whose objects are GG-gauge field-configurations on Σ\Sigma (connections on GG-principal bundles over Σ\Sigma), and whose morphisms are gauge transformations between these. The infinitesimal approximation to this smooth ∞-groupoid, its ∞-Lie algebroid is the (off-shell) BRST complex of the theory. The tangent to the nn-fold higher gauge transformations becomes the nn-fold ghosts in the BRST complex.
More generally GG here can by any smooth ∞-group, such as the circle n-group B n−1U(1)\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1) or the String 2-group or the Fivebrane 6-group, and so on, in which case [Σ,BG conn][\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] is the smooth ∞-groupoid of higher gauge field, gauge transformations between these, higher gauge transformations between those, and so on.
Notice that this means in particular that in higher geometry a gauge theory is a sigma-model quantum field theory: one whose target space is not just a plain manifold but is a moduli stack of gauge field configurations.
A gauge invariant action functional is then a morphism of smooth ∞-groupoids
exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]→U(1).
  \exp( i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to U(1)
  \,.


This is of particular interest, again, if it is local. In fact, in this context now we can also ask that it is “extended” in the sense of extended topological quantum field theory: that we have an action functional not only in top dimension, being a function, but also in codimension 1, being a prequantum bundle, and in higher codimension, being a prequantum n-bundle.
This is notably the case for all (higher) gauge theories of infinity-Chern-Simons theory type, such as ordinary Chern-Simons theory and such as ordinary Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, as well as its higher generalizations. In these cases the action functional exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]\exp(i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] arises itself from transgression of an extended Lagrangian that is defined on the universal moduli stack of gauge field configurations BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} itself, namely from a universal characteristic class in higher nonabelian differential cohomology of the form
L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn.
  \mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


Here B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} is the universal smooth moduli infinity-stack for circle n-bundles with connection. Such a morphism of moduli stacks locally takes a connection differential form AA to a Chern-Simons form CS(A)CS(A), but globally it sends the underlying principal bundle to a circle (n-1)-group principal ∞-bundle and accordingly acts globally on the connection. This is hence a fully local Lagrangian: an extended Lagrangian. Alternatively, one may think of this whole morphism as modulating a prequantum circle n-bundle on the universal moduli stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of gauge fields itself.
For instance for ordinary Chern-Simons theory here n=3n = 3 GG is a semisimple Lie group and L\mathbf{L} is a smooth and differential refinement of the first Pontryagin class/second Chern class, or of an integral multiple of that (the “level” of the theory). In this case L\mathbf{L} may also be thought of as modulating the universal Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. If instead GG is a discrete group then L\mathbf{L} is a cocycle in the U(1)U(1)-group cohomology and this is the extended Lagrangian of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
This extended Lagrangian becomes an extended action functional after transgression: the operation of fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology refines to a morphism of moduli stacks of the form
exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−)):[Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→B n−kU(1) conn,
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k} (-))
  \colon
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{\mathrm{conn}} ]
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n-k}U(1)_{conn}
 \,,


where Σ\Sigma is an oriented closed manifold of dimension kk. This morphism locally simply takes a differential n-form to its ordinary integration of differential forms over Σ k\Sigma_k, but globally it takes the correct higher holonomy of circle n-bundles with connection.
Combining this with an extended ∞-Chern-Simons theory Lagrangian L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn\mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} as above yields for each dimension kk a prequantum circle n-bundle on the space of gauge field configurations over Σ k\Sigma_k, by forming the transgression composite
exp(iS(−))≔exp(2πi∫ Σ k[Σ k,L]):[Σ k,BG conn]→[Σ k,L][Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−))B n−kU(1) conn.
  \exp(i S(-))
  \coloneqq
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k} [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{L}])
   \;\; \colon \;\;
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
  \stackrel{[\Sigma_k, \mathbf{L}]}{\to}
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}]
  \stackrel{\exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k}(-))}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n-k}U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


This morphism locally takes the local differential form incarnation AA of a connection on an ∞-bundle to the exponentiation of the integration of differential forms ∫ ΣCS(A)\int_\Sigma CS(A) of some higher Chern-Simons form, but globally it computes the correct higher holonomy of the higher circle n-bundle with connection over the universal moduli stack of fields, as modulated by the extended Lagrangian L\mathbf{L}.
For a classical mechanical system, the laws of motion can be expressed in terms of an action principle: the actual paths must be the (locally) extremal paths of the action functional.
In one of the formulations of the classical mechanics, called Lagrangean formalism, every mechanical system is characterized by its configuration space and a single function called Lagrangian which determines the laws of motion (the initial configuration should be given independently).
The Lagrangian, Lagrangian function or Lagrangean L=L(q,q⋅,t)L = L(q,\stackrel{\cdot}q,t) is a real valued function of the points in configuration space and their time derivatives (for some sytems also depending on time), such that the corresponding action principle can be expressed as Euler-Lagrange equations: for all ii,
ddt(∂L∂q⋅ i)−∂L∂q i=0
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \stackrel{\cdot}{q}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}_i}  = 0


Here q=(q 1,…,q n)q = (q_1,\ldots, q_n) is the coordinate in the configuration space.
For continuum systems satisfying reasonable locality, Lagrangians can be expressed in terms of integrating a local quantity, so-called Lagrangian density.
For XX a (spacetime/worldvolume) smooth manifold of dimension nn, let E→XE \to X be a vector bundle, to serve as the field bundle for the nn-dimensional field theory Lagrangian to be defined.
Denote the jet bundle by j ∞E→Xj_\infty E \to X and write Ω •,•(j ∞E)\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(j_\infty E) be the corresponding variational bicomplex.

Definition
A local Lagrangian on fields given by the field bundle E→XE \to X is given by an element
L∈Ω n,0(j ∞E),
  L \in \Omega^{n,0}(j_\infty E)
  \,,


hence a horizontal differential form of degree nn on the jet bundle of EE.
The local Lagrangian itself is the pullback of this along the jet prolongation map j ∞:Γ X(E)⟶Γ(j ∞E)j_\infty \colon \Gamma_X(E) \longrightarrow \Gamma(j_\infty E), hence the differential form-valued functional on the space of sections of EE given by
L:(ϕ∈Γ(E))↦L(j ∞ϕ)∈Ω n(X).
  L : (\phi \in \Gamma(E)) \mapsto L(j_\infty \phi) \in \Omega^n(X)
  \,.


The integral (for compact XX)
∫ XL(j ∞(−)):Γ(E)⟶ℝ
  \int_X L(j_\infty(-)) \;\colon\; 
  \Gamma(E) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}


is the corresponding local action functional.

The covariant phase space of a system in physics is the space of all of its solutions to its classical equations of motion, the space of trajectories of the system. Often one considers a parameterization of this by boundary data or choice of a Cauchy surface. This parameterization is what traditionally is just called a “phase space”. The “covariant” in “covariant phase space” is to indicated that it comes without any unnatural choices.
For a system described by Lagrangian mechanics, the covariant phase space comes canonically equipped with a presymplectic structure. A proper phase space or reduced phase space is a quotient space of the covariant phase space on which the presymplectic structure refines to a symplectic structure or Poisson strucure.
Typically these phase spaces are (locally) naturally parameterized by the suitable boundary conditions which uniquely determine the corresponding history of the physical system. Much of the literature on phase spaces deals with parameterizing these boundary conditions.
For instance for a non-relativistic particle propagating on a Riemannian manifold XX with the usual action functional, a trajectory is uniquely fixed by the position x∈Xx \in X and the momentum p∈T x *Xp \in T^*_x X of the particle at a given time. Correspondingly the space of all solutions and hence the (covariant) phase space of the system may be identified with the cotangent bundle T *XT^* X of XX.
(The term “phase” in “phase space” can be related to the phase of complex numbers in this example, see at phase and phase space in physics.)
However, even reduced phase spaces are not all cotangent bundles, typically not, for instance, if they are obtained by symplectic reduction. This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general.
In variational calculus the Euler-Lagrange equations of a nonlinear functional arising from transgression of a local Lagrangian density characterize the extrema of that functional, hence its critical locus (the “shell”).
This originates from and is mainly used in physics, specifically in Lagrangian field theory, where the functional in question is the action functional of a physical system, and where its critical points encode the physically realized field histories by the principle of extremal action.
Hamiltonian mechanics is a formulation of mechanics in which the basic datum in a mechanical system is a function HH, the Hamiltonian of the system, which gives the total energy in the system in terms of the positions and momenta of the objects in the system.
More abstractly, the Hamiltonian is a function on phase space, a manifold whose coordinates are generalised? positions q iq^i and momenta p ip_i. (Compare this to Lagrangian mechanics, in which the Lagrangian is a function on state space?, whose coordinates are generalised positions and velocities.) So to do Hamiltonian mechanics properly, you must ‘mind your pps and qqs’ (blame John Baez for this pun).
To begin with, we often take phase space to be the cotangent bundle of configuration space. (Compare that state space is the tangent bundle of configuration space.) This comes equipped with a natural 22-form
ω=∑ idp i∧dq i, \omega = \sum_i \mathrm{d}p_i \wedge \mathrm{d}q^i ,
or simply ω=dp i∧dq i\omega = \mathrm{d}p_i \wedge \mathrm{d}q^i using the Einstein summation convention. This 22-form is closed, in fact exact, since it is the differential of the action form d¯S=p i∧dq i\bar{\mathrm{d}}S = p_i \wedge \mathrm{d}q^i, and therefore it is a symplectic form.
However, it is also possible to take phase space to be any symplectic manifold, or even any Poisson manifold. In any case, phase space itself gives only the kinematics (in a momentum-based rather than velocity-based sense); you need the Hamiltonian HH to get the dynamics.
Hamiltonian mechanics was developed originally for classical mechanics, but it is also the best known formulation of quantum mechanics; many students of physics (and even more so, students of chemistry) learn it only when they study the latter. This sometimes leads to confusion about the essential differences between classical and quantum physics.
The covariant phase space of a system in physics is the space of all of its solutions to its classical equations of motion, the space of trajectories of the system.

Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry studying symplectic manifolds and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical apparatus of classical mechanics and geometric optics (and the related WKB-method in quantum mechanics and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in harmonic analysis). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is Poisson geometry and a sister branch in odd dimensions is contact geometry. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds, which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of Mikhail Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of Andreas Floer giving birth to symplectic topology or “hard methods” of symplectic geometry.
Poisson manifolds are a mathematical setup for classical mechanics with finitely many degrees of freedom.
A Poisson algebra is a commutative unital associative algebra AA, in this case over the field of real or complex numbers, equipped with a Lie bracket {,}:A⊗A→A\{,\}:A\otimes A\to A such that, for any f∈Af\in A, {f,−}:A→A\{ f,-\}:A\to A is a derivation of AA as an associative algebra.
A Poisson manifold is a real smooth manifold MM equipped with a Poisson structure. A Poisson structure is a Lie algebra bracket {,}:C ∞(M)×C ∞(M)→C ∞(M)\{,\}:C^\infty(M)\times C^\infty(M)\to C^\infty(M) on the vector space of smooth functions on MM which together with the pointwise multiplication of functions makes it a Poisson algebra. As derivations of C ∞(M)C^\infty(M) correspond to smooth tangent vector fields, for each f∈C ∞(M)f\in C^\infty(M) there is a vector X fX_f given by X f(g)={f,g}X_f(g)=\{f,g\} and called the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to the function ff, which is viewed as a classical hamiltonian function.
Alternatively a Poisson structure on a manifold is given by a choice of smooth antisymmetric bivector called a Poisson bivector P∈Λ 2TMP\in\Lambda^2 T M; then {f,g}:=⟨df⊗dg,P⟩\{f,g\}:=\langle d f\otimes d g, P\rangle.
This induces and is equivalently encoded by the structure of a Poisson Lie algebroid.
A morphism h:M→Nh:M\to N of Poisson manifolds is a morphism of smooth manifolds such that, for all f,g∈C ∞(N)f,g\in C^\infty(N), {f∘h,g∘h} M={f,g} N\{f\circ h, g\circ h\}_M = \{f,g\}_N.
Deformation quantization
Kontsevich formality implies that every Poisson manifold has a family of deformation quantizations, parameterized by the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group.

Definition
A symplectic manifold is


a smooth manifold XX of even dimension dimX=2ndim X = 2 n;


equipped with a symplectic form:


a closed smooth 2-form ω∈Ω cl 2(X)\omega \in \Omega^2_{cl}(X);


such that ω\omega is non-degenerate, which means equivalently that


ω ∧n=ω∧ω∧⋯∧ω\omega^{\wedge n}=\omega\wedge\omega\wedge\cdots\wedge\omega has the maximal rank at every point p∈Xp\in X;


(∧ 2T p *X,ω p)(\wedge^2 T^*_p X,\omega_p) is a symplectic vector space for every point p∈Xp\in X.








Definition
A 2n2n-dimensional topological manifold XX is


a real symplectic manifold


equipped with a symplectic atlas:


an atlas consisting of smooth charts ϕ i:U i→X\phi_i:U_i\to X as usual,


such that the transition functions ϕ j −1∘ϕ i:ϕ i −1(ϕ i(U i)∩ϕ j(U j))→ϕ j −1(ϕ i(U i)∩ϕ j(U j))\phi_j^{-1}\circ\phi_i:\phi_i^{-1}(\phi_i(U_i)\cap\phi_j(U_j))\to \phi_j^{-1}(\phi_i(U_i)\cap\phi_j(U_j)) preserve the standard symplectic form ω 0=∑ i=1 ndx i∧dp i\omega_0=\sum_{i=1}^n dx_i\wedge dp_i on ℝ 2n\mathbb{R}^{2n} with the basis (x 1,…,x n,p 1,…,p n)(x_1,\ldots,x_n,p_1,\ldots,p_n).






Remark
The non-degenracy of the symplectic form implies that it defines an isomorphism
ω(−,−):Γ(TX)→Γ(T *X)
  \omega(-,-) : \Gamma(T X) \to \Gamma(T^* X)


between sections of the tangent bundle – vector fields – and sections of the cotangent bundle – differential 1-forms – on XX by the map
(v∈T xX)↦(ω(v,−)∈T x *X).
  (v \in T_x X) \mapsto (\omega(v,-) \in T^*_x X)
  \,.



Definition
The vector fields in the image of the exact 1-forms under the isomorphism, remark , are called Hamiltonian vector fields.

This means that for H∈C ∞(X)H \in C^\infty(X) a smooth function and dHd H its differential 1-form, the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field v H∈Γ(TX)v_H \in \Gamma(T X) is the unique vector field such that
dH=ω(v H,−)
  d H = \omega(v_H, -)
  \,


Equivalently, for ϕℝ 2n→X\phi \mathbb{R}^{2n} \to X a coordinate chart of XX and ϕ *ω=ω ijdx i∧dx j\phi^*\omega = \omega_{i j} d x^i \wedge d x^j the symplectic form on this patch, the Hamiltonian vector field v Hv_H is
v H=∂H∂x i(ω −1) ij∂ j.
  v_H =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial x^i} (\omega^{-1})^{i j} \partial_j
  \,.


Darboux coordinates
By Darboux's theorem every symplectic manifold has an atlas by coordinate charts ℝ 2n≃U↪X\mathbb{R}^{2n} \simeq U \hookrightarrow X on which the symplectic form takes the canonical form ω| U=∑ k=1 ndx 2k∧dx 2k+1\omega|_U = \sum_{k = 1}^n d x^{2k} \wedge d x^{2 k+1}.
Relation to almost symplectic structure
The existence of a 2-form ω∈Ω 2(X)\omega \in \Omega^2(X) which is non-degenerate (but not necessarily closed) is equivalent to the existence of a Sp-structure on XX, a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle along the inclusion of the symplectic group into the general linear group
Sp(2n)↪GL(2n).
  Sp(2n) \hookrightarrow GL(2n)
  \,.


Such an Sp(2n)-structure is also called an almost symplectic structure on XX. Adding the extra condition that dω=0d \omega = 0 – the condition for integrability of G-structures – makes it a genuine symplectic structure. See at integrability of G-structures – Examples – Symplectic structure.
A metaplectic structure on a symplectic or almost symplectic manifold is in turn lift of the structure group to the metaplectic group.
Relation to almost Hermitian and Kähler structure
By the above, a symplectic manifold structure is an integrable Sp(2n,ℝ)↪GL(2n,ℝ)Sp(2n,\mathbb{R}) \hookrightarrow GL(2n,\mathbb{R})-structure. Further reduction of the structure group along the maximal compact subgroup inclusion of the unitary group U(n)↪Sp(2n,ℝ)U(n) \hookrightarrow Sp(2n,\mathbb{R}) yields is an almost Hermitian structure. If that is again first order integrable then it is Kähler structure.
Such a refinement from symplectic to Kähler structure is also called a choice of Kähler polarization.
Symplectomorphisms

Proposition
For (X,ω)(X, \omega) a symplectic manifold, the vector fields v∈Γ(TX)v \in \Gamma(T X) that generate diffeomorphisms that preserve the symplectic structure are precisely the locally Hamiltonian vector fields.


Proof
The condition in question is that the Lie derivative
L vω=0
  L_v \omega = 0


vanishes. By Cartan's magic formula and using that dω=0d \omega = 0 this is equivalently
dι vω=0.
  d \iota_v \omega = 0
  \,.


By the Poincare lemma it follows that there is locally a function HH with dH=ι vωd H = \iota_v \omega.

Poisson structure

Definition
For (X,ω)(X,\omega) a symplectic manifold, define a bilinear skew-symmetric map
{−,−}:C ∞(X)⊗C ∞(X)→C ∞(X)
  \{-,-\} : C^\infty(X) \otimes C^\infty(X) \to C^\infty(X)


by
{F,H}:=ι v Fι v Hω.
  \{F,H\} := \iota_{v_F} \iota_{v_H} \omega
  \,.


In a coordinate chart this says that
{F,H}=(∂F∂x i)(ω −1) ij(∂H∂x j).
  \{F,H\} = (\frac{\partial F}{\partial x^i}) (\omega^{-1})^{i j}
    (\frac{\partial H}{\partial x^j})
  \,.



Proposition
The bracket {−,−}\{-,-\} makes C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) a Poisson algebra.

A Poisson manifold may be thought of as a Poisson Lie algebroid, a Lie algebroid with extra structure: called an n-symplectic manifold for n=1n = 1.
By Lie integration this Lie algebroid should integrate to a Lie groupoid with extra structure. Symplectic groupoids are supposed to be these objects that integrate n-symplectic manifold aka Poisson manifolds in this sense.
The groupoid algebra of these symplectic groupoids are C-star algebras that may be regarded as the quantization of the original Poisson manifold. This is described in the references below.
Lie integration and Poisson manifolds
Every Lie groupoid integrating a Poisson Lie algebroid is naturally a symplectic Lie groupoid. Picking always the unique source-simply connected integrating Lie groupoid produces a functor
Σ:PoissonManifolds→SymplecticGroupoids.
  \Sigma : PoissonManifolds \to SymplecticGroupoids
  \,.


When the Poisson manifold we start with happens to be a symplectic manifold, then its symplectic Lie groupoid is always the fundamental groupoid of XX:
(X,π)symplectic⇒Σ(X,π)≃ isoΠ(X).
  (X,\pi)\;\; symplectic
  \;\;\Rightarrow\;\;
  \Sigma(X,\pi) \simeq_{iso} \Pi(X)
  \,.


When XX is simply connected such that Π(X)\Pi(X) is the codiscrete groupoid Pair(X)Pair(X) we have that the symplectic form on Mor(Π(X))=X×XMor(\Pi(X)) = X \times X is ω⊗(−ω)\omega \otimes (-\omega), for ω\omega the symplectic form on XX.
Conversely, for every symplectic groupoid X\mathbf{X} there is a unique Poisson manifold structure on its manifold X 0\mathbf{X}_0 of objects such that the codomain map t:X 1→X 0t \colon \mathbf{X}_1 \to \mathbf{X}_0 is a homomorphism of Poisson manifolds. (For instance Racaniere, theorem 6.3) One says also that X\mathbf{X} integrates the Poisson manifold X 0\mathbf{X}_0.
Symplectic realization
The source map of a symplectic groupoid over a Poisson manifold constitutes a symplectic realization of this Poisson manifold, hence its canonical desingularization via Lie integration. See at symplectic realization for more.
In geometric quantization of Poisson manifolds
In the groupoid approach to quantization symplectic groupoids are used to discuss geometric quantization not just of symplectic manifolds but more generally of Poisson manifolds.
See geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids.

A reduced phase space of open Poisson sigma-model
The symplectic groupoid of a Poisson manifold is also the reduced phase space of the open sector of the corresponding Poisson sigma-model. (Cattaneo-Felder 01)
Traditional
Multisymplectic geometry is a generalization of symplectic geometry in the context of variational calculus and mechanical systems in which the symplectic form is generalized from a closed 2-form to a closed n+1n+1-form, for n≥1n \geq 1 – the n-plectic form.
It is closely related to the de Donder-Weyl formalism of variational calculus. In the context of quantization it is meant to provide a refinement of geometric quantization which is well-adapted to nn-dimensional quantum field theory. However, details of the multisymplectic quantization procedure remain under investigation.
From the nnPOV
We comment a bit on how to, presumably, think of multisymplectic geometry from the nPOV, in the context of higher geometric quantization. Readers may want to skip ahead to traditional technical discussion at Extended phase space.

Multisymplectic geometry is (or should be) to symplectic geometry as extended quantum field theory is to non-extended quantum field theory:
in the multisymplectic extended phase space of an nn-dimensional field theory a state is not just a point, but an nn-dimensional subspace.

See also n-plectic geometry.
Multisymplectic geometry is a generalization of symplectic geometry to cases where the symplectic 2-form is generalized to a higher degree differential form.
In as far as symplectic geometry encodes Hamiltonian mechanics, multisymplectic geometry may be regarded as resolving the symplectic geometry of the Hamiltonian mechanics of classical field theory: the kinematics of an nn-dimensional field theory may be encoded in an degree (n+1)(n+1) symplectic form.
In this application to physics, multisymplectic geometry is also known as the covariant symplectic approach to field theory (e.g. section 2 here).
The idea is that under a suitable fiber integration multisymplectic geometry becomes ordinary symplectic form on the ordinary phase space of the theory, similar to, and in fact as a special case of, how for instance a line bundle on a loop space with a 2-form Chern class may arise by transgression from a bundle gerbe down on the original space, with a 3-form class.
By effectively undoing this implicit transgression in the ordinary Hamiltonian mechanics of classical field theory, multisymplectic geometry provides a general framework for a geometric, covariant formulation of classical field theory, where covariant formulation means that spacelike and timelike directions on a given space-time be treated on equal footing.
A Lie n-algebroid is symplectic if it is equipped with a non-degenerate binary invariant polynomial. This generalizes the notion of a symplectic form on a symplectic manifold, to which it reduces for n=0n = 0.

Definition
A symplectic Lie nn-algebroid is a pair
(𝔞,⟨−,−⟩)
  (\mathfrak{a}, \langle -,- \rangle)


consisting of


a Lie n-algebroid 𝔞\mathfrak{a};


a binary invariant polynomial ⟨−,−⟩\langle- , - \rangle of degree (n+2)(n+2)
(a closed element in the shifted elements of the Weil algebra W(𝔞)W(\mathfrak{a}))
which is non-degenerate.



The Chern-Simons element that witnesses this transgression is the Lagrangian of the corresponding AKSZ theory sigma-model with 𝔞\mathfrak{a} as its target space and the invariant polynomial ⟨−,−⟩\langle -,- \rangle as the (curvature of) its background gauge field.

General
A spacetime is a manifold that models space and time in physics.
This is formalized by saying that a spacetime is a smooth Lorentzian space (X,μ)(X,\mu) equipped with a time orientation (see there).
Hence a point in a spacetime is called an event.
In the context of classical general relativity a spacetime is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional. A connected Lorentzian manifold is either time orientable or it has a two-sheeted covering which is time orientable.
In classical physics, notably in special relativity and general relativity points in XX model coordinates where events can take place from the viewpoint of an observer (“points in space and time”) while the metric μ\mu models the field of gravity in general relativity.
Intermingling of space and time
The noun “spacetime” is used in both special relativity and general relativity, but is best motivated from the viewpoint of general relativity. Special relativity deals with the Minkowski spacetime only. The Minkowski spacetime allows a canonical choice of global coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.
Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined canonical time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the physical interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates changes over the domain of definition.

Lorentzian manifold
A Lorentzian manifold (X,η)(X, \eta) of dimension (d+1)(d+1) is a smooth manifold equipped with a pseudo-Riemannian metric η\eta of signature [+−−⋯−][+--\cdots -] (but note that the complementary choice [−++⋯+][-++\cdots +] is also used in the literature). This equips the tangent space T xXT_x X at every point x∈Xx \in X canonically with the structure of a (d+1)(d+1)-dimensional Minkowski space. Accordingly, tangent vectors v∈T xXv \in T_x X of XX are called timelike , lightlike or spacelike , if their norm-square μ x(v,v)\mu_x(v,v) is positive, zero or negative, respectively. See also at causal structure.
Causal structure
A time orientation on a Lorentzian manifold XX is a smooth (or, depending on the author, continuous) vector field ν∈Γ(TX)\nu \in \Gamma(T X) such that at all points x∈Xx \in X the vector ν x\nu_x is timelike. In general, a Lorentzian manifold does not have globally defined timelike continuous vector fields. Sometimes only Lorentzian manifolds admitting a time orientation are also called spacetimes.
Given a time orientation ν\nu, a vector v∈T xXv \in T_x X is future directed if it is timelike or light-like and its inner product with the time orientation vector at that point is positive, μ x(ν,v x)>0\mu_x(\nu,v_x) \gt 0.
Since ν\nu itself is smooth, it follows that it is future directed with respect to itself at every point.
A smooth curve in XX, i.e. a smooth map γ:[0,1]→X\gamma : [0,1] \to X is called a timelike curve or a lightlike curve or a spacelike curve or a future-directed curve precisely if all of its tangent vectors (γ *∂ s)∈T γ(s)X(\gamma_* \partial_s) \in T_{\gamma(s)} X are.
We say that a point y∈Xy \in X lies in the future of a point x∈Xx \in X if y=xy = x or if there exists a future-directed curve γ:[0,1]→X\gamma : [0,1] \to X with γ(0)=x\gamma(0) = x and γ(1)=y\gamma(1) = y. Equivalently, in this case xx lies in the past of yy.
Notions of causality
We say that (X,μ)(X,\mu) has closed timelike curves (closed future-directed curves) if there exists a non-constant timelike (future-dierected) curve starting and ending at some point xx. Spacetimes which do not contain closed timelike curves are called chronological, spacetimes which do not contain closed future directed (i.e. non-spacelike) curves are called causal.

Definition
Given a time orientated spacetime L, the chronological future I +(p)I^+(p) of a point p∈Lp \in L is the set of events that can be reached by a future directed timelike curve starting from p:
I +(p):={q∈L|there exists a future directed timelike curveλ(t)withλ(0)=pandλ(1)=q}
I^+(p) := \{ q \in L | \text{there exists a future directed timelike curve} \lambda(t) \text{with} \lambda(0) = p and \lambda(1)=q \}


The causal future J +(p)J^+(p) of pp is defined in the same way with future directed timelike replaced by future directed causal aka non-spacelike.


Definition
A subset S of a time orientated spacetime L is said to be achronal if no two points in S can be connected by a future directed timelike curve, i.e. for all p,q∈Lp, q \in L we have q∉I +(p)q \notin I^+(p).


Theorem
boundary of chronological future Let L be a time orientated spacetime and S⊂LS \subset L. Then the boundary of I +(S)I^+(S) is either empty or an achronal, three-dimensional, embedded, C 0C^0-submanifold of L.

This is theorem 8.1.3 in the book of Wald.
Examples of non-chronological Lorentzian manifolds are the anti de Sitter space and the Kerr spacetime.
While the former is more of a theoretical interest due to the maximality of the symmetry group, the latter is usually seen as a solution with relevance to actual physics, despite the fact that causality does not hold everywhere.
Note that the property of being chronological is not strong enough to enforce causality as understood in everyday life: Even if there are no closed future-directed curves, there still may be e.g. nonclosed ergodic future-directed curves (they come close to every point they already passed in the “past”). An often used stronger condition that models the everyday notion of causality is that the manifold has to be globally hyperbolic? (Wikipedia), which, as already mentioned, excludes certain solutions modelling e.g. black holes.
Being causal means being a poset
Precisely if the Lorentzian space is causal in that there are no closed future-directed curves is the relation

(x≤y)⇔(x \leq y) \Leftrightarrow “yy is in the future of xx”

a poset, hence a category with at most a single morphism between any two objects:
The objects of this category are the points of XX. A morphism x→yx \to y is a pair of points x≤yx \leq y with yy in the future of xx. Composition of morphisms is transitivity of the relation. The identity morphism on xx is the reflexivity x≤xx \leq x.
The anti-symmetry (x≤y≤x)⇒(x=y)(x \leq y \leq x) \Rightarrow (x = y) is precisely the absence of closed future-directed curves in XX.
Conversely, from just knowing XX as a smooth manifold and knowing this poset structure on XX, one can reconstruct the light cone structure of (X,μ)(X,\mu), i.e. the information about which tangent vectors are timelike, lightlike, etc.
One can see

(…reference…)

that the pseudo-Riemannian metric μ\mu may be reconstructed from the lightcone structure and the volume density? that it induces. In this sense a Lorentzian manifold without future-directed curves is equivalently a smooth poset equipped with a smooth measure on its space of objects.
Generalized smooth Lorentzian spaces
…

A smooth Lorentzian space is supposed to be like a Lorentzian manifold, but whose underlying space is not necessarily a smooth manifold, but a generalized smooth space.
So this is “something like” a poset internal to a category of measure spaces, or a poset-valued 2-stack on something like CartSp or the like.

…
In physics the theory of special relativity describes dynamics in physical spacetime in absence of a field of gravity.
Specifically, it models


spacetime as a flat time-oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold:
Minkowski space;


trajectories of point particles as timelike curves in Minkowski space.


the electromagnetic field as a closed 2-form on Minkowski space.


the Lorentz force exerted by the electromagnetic field on a charged particle as the contraction of that 2-form with the tangent vector of the trajectory of the particle.


If instead of restricting to Minkowski space, spacetime is allowed to be an arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian manifold one speaks of the resulting framework as the theory of general relativity.
Mathematically, special relativity is essentially the theory of Minkowski space as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, hence equipped with the constant metric tensor which at each point is the bilinear form with signature (−,+,⋯,+)(-,+, \cdots, +) or else (+,−,⋯,−)(+,-,\cdots, -) (depending on convention). The null-vectors in this metric characterize the speed of light. The linear isometries of this metric are the Lorentz transformations and the fact that with the Minkowski metric these also preserve, hence, null rays is the mathematical model for the famous phenomenological observation that “the speed of light is the same in all reference systems”.

The theory called the theory of general relativity is a classical field theory that in physics describes the field of gravity.
In general relativity, physical spacetime is modeled in terms of differential geometry as a Lorentzian manifold whose pseudo-Riemannian metric – or rather the Levi-Civita connection that corresponds to it – encodes the field of gravity.
The action functional describing the dynamics of this field is the Einstein-Hilbert action, in which the field of gravity enters in terms of the integral of the scalar curvature of the Levi-Civita connection over spacetime.
As is usual in classical field theory, the physically realized configurations – here: Levi-Civita connections – are those that extremize this functional. The Euler-Lagrange equations characterizing these extrema are the Einstein equations.
Historically the theory of general relativity was developed by Albert Einstein based on the theory known as special relativity. Given the conceptual simplicity of the Einstein-Hilbert action, there are several variations of his original version of the theory that are immediately obtained by adding certain terms to the action functional. One of these generalization is supergravity, which extends the theory from ordinary differential geometry to supergeometry.

A field configuration of the physical theory of gravity on a spacetime XX is equivalently


a vielbein field, hence a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle along BO(n−1,1)→BGL(n)\mathbf{B} O(n-1,1) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n), defining a pseudo-Riemannian metric;


a connection that is locally a Lie algebra-valued 1-form with values in the Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω):TX→𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d-1,1)


such that this is a Cartan connection.


(This parameterization of the gravitational field is called the first-order formulation of gravity.) The component EE of the connection is the vielbein that encodes a pseudo-Riemannian metric g=E⋅Eg = E \cdot E on XX and makes XX a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Its quanta are the gravitons.
The non-propagating field? Ω\Omega is the spin connection.
The action functional on the space of such connection which defines the classical field theory of gravity is the Einstein-Hilbert action.
More generally, supergravity is a gauge theory over a supermanifold XX for the super Poincare group. The field of supergravity is a Lie-algebra valued form with values in the super Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω,Ψ):TX→𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E,\Omega, \Psi) : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)


The additional fermionic field Ψ\Psi is the gravitino field.
So the configuration space of gravity on some XX is essentially the moduli space of Riemannian metrics on XX.

A quantum field theory of supergravity is similar to the theory of gravity, but where (in first order formulation) the latter is given by an action functional (the Einstein-Hilbert action functional) on the space of connections (over spacetime) with values in the Poincare Lie algebra 𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{iso}(n,1), supergravity is defined by an extension of this to an action functional on the space of connections with values in the super Poincare Lie algebra 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{siso}(n,1). One says that supergravity is the theory of local (Poincaré) supersymmetry in the same sense that ordinary gravity is the theory of “local Poincaré-symmetry”. These are gauge theories for the Poincare Lie algebra and the super Poincare Lie algebra, respectively, in that the field (physics) is a Cartan connection for the inclusion o(n,1)↪𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)o(n,1) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{siso}(n,1):
if we write 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{siso}(n,1) as a semidirect product of the translation Lie algebra ℝ (n,1)\mathbb{R}^{(n,1)}, the special orthogonal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{so}(n,1) and a spin group representation Γ\Gamma, then locally a connection is a Lie algebra valued 1-form
A:TX→𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(n,1)


that decomposes into three components, A=(E,Ω,Ψ)A = (E, \Omega, \Psi):


a ℝ n,1\mathbb{R}^{n,1}-valued 1-form EE – the vielbein
(this encodes the pseudo-Riemannian metric and hence the field of gravity);


a 𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{so}(n,1)-valued 1-form Ω\Omega – called the spin connection;


a Γ\Gamma-valued 1-form Ψ\Psi – called the gravitino field.


Typically in fact the field content of supergravity is larger, in that a field AA is really an ∞-Lie algebra-valued differential form with values in an ∞-Lie algebra such as the supergravity Lie 3-algebra (DAuriaFreCastellani) 𝔰𝔲𝔤𝔯𝔞(10,1)\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1). Specifically such a field
A:TX→𝔰𝔲𝔤𝔯𝔞(10,1)
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)


has one more component

a 3-form CC – the supergravity C-field.

The gauge transformations on the space of such connections that are parameterized by the elements of Γ\Gamma are called supersymmetries.

The condition of gauge invariance of an action functional on 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬\mathfrak{siso}-connections is considerably more restrictive than for one on 𝔦𝔰𝔬\mathfrak{iso}-connections. For instance there is, under mild assumptions, a unique maximally supersymmetric supergravity extension of the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert action on a 4-dimensional manifold. This in turn is obtained from the unique (under mild assumptions) maximally supersymmetric supergravity action functional on a (10,1)-dimensional spacetime by thinking of the 4-dimensional action function as being a dimensional reduction of the 11-dimensional one.
This uniqueness (under mild conditions) is one reason for interest in supergravity theories. Another important reason is that supergravity theories tend to remove some of the problems that are encountered when trying to realize gravity as a quantum field theory. Originally there had been high hopes that the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 4-dimensions is fully renormalizable. This couldn’t be shown computationally – until recently: triggered by new insights recently there there has been lots of renewed activity on the renormalizability of maximal supergravity.
As a gauge theory – Super Cartan geometry
Ordinary Einstein gravity has a natural formulation in terms of Cartan geometry for the inclusion of the Lorentz Lie algebra into the Poincaré Lie algebra 𝔬(d−1,1)↪ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}). In this first order formulation of gravity a field configuration is a Cartan connection with such coefficients.
This perspective directly generalizes to supergeometry and yields the superspace formulation of theories of supegravity – super Cartan geometry.
After picking a dimension d∈ℕd\in \mathbb{N} and writing ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}) for the Poincaré Lie algebra, then a choice of “number of supersymmetries” is a choice of real spin representation NN. Then the direct sum
ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1|N)≔ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)⏟ even⊕N⏟ odd
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})
  \coloneqq
  \underbrace{\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})}_{even} \oplus \underbrace{N}_{odd}


regarded as a super vector space with NN in odd degree becomes a super Lie algebra by letting the [even,odd][even,odd] bracket be given by the defining action and by letting the [odd,odd][odd,odd] bracket be given by a canonically induced bilinear and 𝔬\mathfrak{o}-equivariant pairing – the super Poincaré Lie algebra. This still canonical contains the Lorentz Lie algebra 𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}) and the quotient
ℝ d−1,1|N≔ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1|N)/𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N} 
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})/\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})


is called super Minkowski spacetime (equipped with its super translation Lie algebra structure).
From this, a super-Cartan geometry is defined in direct analogy to the Cartan formulation of Riemannian geometry

Indeed, all the traditional literature on supergravity (e.g. (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91)) is phrased, more or less explicitly, in terms of Cartan connections for the inclusion of the Lorentz group into the super Poincaré group this way, this being the formalization of what physicists mean when saying that they pass to “local supersymmetry”.
One subtlety to take care of is that this makes spacetime a super-spacetime locally modeled on super Minkowski spacetime. But the resulting theory is supposed to be a field theory on an ordinary spacetime locally modeled on ordinary Minkowski spacetime. This is enforced by a further constraint on the super-Cartan connection which forces it to be determined by the bosonic manifold underlying the given supermanifold. This constraint is variously known as the superspace constraints or as rheonomy .
The other subtlety to take care of is that a key aspect of higher dimensional supergravity theories is that their field content necessarily includes, in addition to the graviton and the gravitino, higher differential n-form fields, notably the 2-form B-field of 10-dimensional type II supergravity and heterotic supergravity as well as the 3-form C-field of 11-dimensional supergravity.
This means that these higher dimensional supergravity theories are not in fact entirely described by super-Cartan geometry – but by super-higher Cartan geometry.
This follows a key insight due to (D’Auria-Fré-Regge 80, D’Auria-Fré 82) – the D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity – that the “tensor multiplet” fields of higher dimensional supergravity theories as above are naturally brought into the previous perspective if only one allows more general Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras.
Namely, we may add to the above CE-algebra

a single generator c 3c_3 of degree (3,even)(3,even)

and extend the differential to that by the formula
d CEc 3=12ψ¯Γ ab∧ψ∧e a∧e b.
  d_{CE} \, c_3 = \frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b
  \,.


This still squares to zero due to the remarkable property of 11d super Minkowski spacetime by which 12ψ¯Γ ab∧ψ∧e a∧e b∈CE 4(ℑ𝔰𝔬(10,1|N=1))\frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b \in CE^4(\mathfrak{Iso}(10,1|N=1)) is a representative of an exception super-Lie algebra cohomology class. (The collection of all these exceptional classes constitutes what is known as the brane scan).
In the textbook (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91) a beautiful algorithm for constructing and handling higher supergravity theories based on such generalized CE-algebras is presented, but it seems fair to say that the authors struggle a bit with the right mathematical perspective to describe what is really happening here.
But from a modern perspective this becomes crystal clear: these generalized CE algebras are CE-algebras not of Lie algebras but of strong homotopy Lie algebras, hence of L-infinity algebras, in fact of Lie (p+1)-algebras for (p+1)(p+1) the degree of the relevant differential form field.
Specifically, me may write the above generalized CE-algebra with the extra degree-3 generator c 3c_3 as the CE-algebra CE(𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢)CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) 
of the supergravity Lie 3-algebra 𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}.
Now a morphism
Ω •(U)⟵CE(𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢):A
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \stackrel{}{\longleftarrow} CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) \;\colon\; A


encodes graviton and gravitino fields as above, but in addition it encodes a 3-form
C 3≔A(c 3)∈Ω (3,even)(U)
  C_3 \coloneqq A(c_3) \in \Omega^{(3,even)}(U)


whose curvature
G 4=dC 3+12Ψ¯Γ ab∧Ψ∧E a∧E b
  G_4 = \mathbf{d}C_3 + \frac{1}{2}\bar \Psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \Psi \wedge E_a \wedge E_b


satisfies a modified Bianchi identity, crucial for the theory of 11-dimensional supergravity (D’Auria-Fré 82).
So this collection of differential form data is no longer a Lie algebra valued differential form, it is an L-infinity algebra valued differential form, with values in the supergravity Lie 3-algebra.
The quotient
ℝ^ 10,1|N=1≔𝔤/𝔥=𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢/𝔬(ℝ 10,1|N=1)
  \widehat{\mathbb{R}}^{10,1|N=1}
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}
  =
  \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} / \mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{10,1|N=1})


is known as extended super Minkowski spacetime.
The Lie integration of this is a smooth 3-group GG which receives a map from the Lorentz group.
This means that a global description of the geometry which (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91) discuss locally on charts has to be a higher kind of Cartan geometry which is locally modeled not just on cosets, but on the homotopy quotients of (smooth, supergeometric, …) infinity-groups – higher Cartan geometry.
Solutions with global supersymmetry
A solution to the bosonic Einstein equations of ordinary gravity – some Riemannian manifold – has a global symmetry if it has a Killing vector.
Accordingly, a configuration that solves the supergravity Euler-Lagrange equations is a global supersymmetry if it has a Killing spinor: a covariantly constant spinor.
Here the notion of covariant derivative includes the usual Levi-Civita connection, but also in general torsion components and contributions from other background gauge fields such as a Kalb-Ramond field and the RR-fields in type II supergravity or heterotic supergravity.
Of particular interest to phenomenologists around the turn of the millennium (but maybe less so today with new experimental evidence) has been in solutions of spacetime manifolds of the form M 4×Y 6M^4 \times Y^6 for M 4M^4 the locally observed Minkowski spacetime (that plays a role as the background for all available particle accelerator experiments) and a small closed 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold Y 6Y^6.
In the absence of further fields besides gravity, the condition that such a configuration has precisely one Killing spinor and hence precisely one global supersymmetry turns out to be precisely that Y 6Y^6 is a Calabi-Yau manifold. This is where all the interest into these manifolds in string theory comes from. (Notice though that nothing in the theory itself demands such a compactification. It is only the phenomenological assumption of the factorized spacetime compactification together with N=1N = 1 supersymmetry that does so.)
More generally, in the presence of other background gauge fields, the Calabi-Yau condition here is deformed. One also speaks of generalized Calabi-Yau spaces. (For instance (GMPT05)).

As a background for Green-Schwarz σ\sigma-models
The equations of motion of those theories of supergravity which qualify as target spaces for Green-Schwarz action functional sigma models (e.g. 10d heterotic supergravity for the heterotic string and 10d type II supergravity for the type II string) are supposed to be equivalent to those σ\sigma-models being well defined (the WZW-model term being well defined, hence κ\kappa-symmetry being in effect). See at Green-Schwarz action – References – Supergravity equations of motion for pointers.
Scalar moduli spaces and UU-duality
The compact exceptional Lie groups form a series
E 8,E 7,E 6
  E_8, E_7, E_6


which is usefully thought of to continue as
E 5:=Spin(10),E 4:=SU(5),E 3:=SU(3)×SU(2).
  E_5 := Spin(10), E_4 := SU(5), E_3 := SU(3) \times SU(2)
  \,.


Supergravity theories are controled by the corresponding split real forms
E 8(8),E 7(7),E 6(6)
  E_{8(8)}, E_{7(7)}, E_{6(6)}


E 5(5):=Spin(5,5),E 4(4):=SL(5,ℝ),E 3(3):=SL(3,ℝ)×SL(2,ℝ).
  E_{5(5)} := Spin(5,5), E_{4(4)} := SL(5, \mathbb{R}), 
  E_{3(3)} := SL(3, \mathbb{R}) \times SL(2, \mathbb{R})
  \,.


For instance the scalar fields in the field supermultiplet of 3≤d≤113 \leq d \leq 11-dimensional supergravity have moduli spaces parameterized by the homogeneous spaces
E n(n)/K n
  E_{n(n)}/ K_n


for
n=11−d,
  n = 11 - d
  \,,


where K nK_n is the maximal compact subgroup of E n(n)E_{n(n)}:
K 8≃Spin(16),K 7≃SU(8),K 6≃Sp(4)
  K_8 \simeq Spin(16), K_7 \simeq SU(8), K_6 \simeq Sp(4)


K 5≃Spin(5)×Spin(5),K 4≃Spin(5),K 3≃SU(2)×SO(2).
  K_5 \simeq Spin(5) \times Spin(5), 
  K_4 \simeq Spin(5),
  K_3 \simeq SU(2) \times SO(2)
  \,.


Therefore E n(n)E_{n(n)} acts as a global symmetry on the supergravity fields.
This is no longer quite true for their UV-completion by the corresponding compactifications of string theory (e.g. type II string theory for type II supergravity, etc.). Instead, on these a discrete subgroup
E n(n)(ℤ)↪E n(n)
  E_{n(n)}(\mathbb{Z}) \hookrightarrow E_{n(n)}


acts as global symmetry. This is called the U-duality group of the supergravity theory (see there for more).
It has been argued that this pattern should continue in some way further to the remaining values 0≤d<30 \leq d \lt 3, with “Kac-Moody groups” corresponding to the Kac-Moody algebras
𝔢 9,𝔢 10,𝔢 11.
  \mathfrak{e}_9, \mathfrak{e}_10, \mathfrak{e}_{11}
  \,.


Continuing in the other direction to d=10d = 10 (n=1n = 1) connects to the T-duality group O(d,d,ℤ)O(d,d,\mathbb{Z}) of type II string theory.

Generally in a context of Kaluza-Klein compactification a dilaton is a field on a lower-dimensional spacetime which is a component of the field of gravity on a higher dimensional spacetime, in that it is part of the metric of the fiber-spaces on which the KK-compactification takes place. Specifically for KK-compactification on a circle fiber “the dilaton” (or “radion”) is the lowest Fourier mode of the metric of the circle, hence is the length (circumference) (or radius, up to a factor) of the circle fiber.
The subtlety in Kaluza-Klein theory is that the dilaton should have small but approximately constant value in order to yields effective field theory gravity coupled to gauge theory in lower dimensions from pure gravity in higher dimensions. This is the problem of moduli stabilization.
Specifically in string theory, together with the field of gravity and the Kalb?Ramond field?, the dilaton field is one of the three massless bosonic fields that appears in effective background quantum field theories. For type IIA string theory this may be interpreted as the Kaluza-Klein dilaton in the above sense, arising from 11-dimensional supergravity (M-theory) compactified on a circle. Similarly for heterotic string theory and Horava-Witten theory.

A black hole is a spacetime that solves Einstein equations of general relativity characterized by the fact that it possesses an event horizon hypersurface (or several of them) which has a number of special characteristics, for example that light cannot escape from the space confined by the horizon hypersurface due to gravitational effects. Much of the theoretical considerations are about the entropy of black holes (cf. Bekenstein-Hawking entropy) and the information paradox.
Black holes are considered theoretically for gravitational theories in various number dd of dimension. For d≥5d \geq 5 a black hole spacetime may have nontrivial topology, e.g. black rings are possible.
Topology
Hawking’s Theorem of Black Hole topology asserts that the in case of d=4d = 4 asymptotically flat stationary black holes satisfying the suitable dominant energy condition, the cross sections of the event horizon are spherical.
Galloway and Schoen extended this theorem to higher dimensions; they showed that the cross sections of event horizon (stationary case) and the outer (apparent) horizon (general case) are of Yamabe type.

Ordinary classical mechanics of point particles may be regarded as the theory of action functionals on mapping spaces of maps from the real line to some space.
In classical field theory one instead studies functionals on mapping spaces on higher dimensional domains.
Classical gauge theory
Of particular interest are classical field theories that are gauge theories. A powerful formalism for handling these is provided by BV theory, which effectively realizes spaces of classical fields as ∞-Lie algebroids. BV-formalism can be understood as a means to capture a classical gauge field theory in such a way that it lends itself to quantization. (See below)
Classical mechanics is that part of classical physics dealing with the deterministic physics of point particles and rigid bodies; often the systems with the infinitely many degrees of freedom are also included (like infinite arrays of particles and their continuous limits like classical mechanics of strings, membranes, elastic media and of classical fields). For the continuous systems, the equations of motion can often be explained by the partial differential equations, describing classical physical fields of quantities (typically smooth possibly vector valued functions on manifolds), including background fields like metric; the latter (sub)area is the classical field theory, but it is often studied separately from the classical mechanics of the finite systems of particles; especially if non-classical features or interpretations are involved (e.g. supersymmetry, or unusual case of non-variational equations of motion etc.). In Hamiltonian reduction, due to conservation laws, many systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, reduce to the finite ones.
Nondissipative systems with finitely many degrees of freedom may be described geometrically using symplectic manifolds, or more generally Poisson manifolds; the later may also sometimes appear as reductions of the systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom.
Classical mechanics of a system of point particles and rigid bodies is usually divided into statics, kinematics and dynamics. Statics studies the balance of forces in a system which does not move, or in a stationary flow. Kinematics studies the relation between position, velocity and acceleration of bodies in a mechanical system, without reference to the causes of motion. Dynamics studies motion with reference to the causes of motion and interaction between bodies and its manifestation via (quantified) forces, energy and mass assigned to bodies in motion and interaction.
For a theoretical classical mechanics one often starts with a concrete system of bodies with pulleys, strings, spins, external and internal forces, and dissipative sinks and sources (e.g. friction forces), which are then analysed to get the configuration or phase space of the system, the equations of motion and possibly to determine some special observables of interest. Once abstracted that way, the rest of the study is a rather special case of the theory of dynamical systems, which itself studies general (either deterministic or stochastic) spatially-parametrized systems in a (discrete or continuous) time evolution.
A terminological and scope discussion is archived here.
An oscillation is a periodic motion of a physical system, i.e. as a function of time, the position of the system of particles expressed as a coordinate in a configuration space depends as t↦x(t)t\mapsto x(t) where x(t)=x(t+I)x(t) = x(t+I) where II is a constant called the period of the motion. The motion can pertain to a system of particles, to the coordinates determining the position of a rigid body or can express the magnitude of some physical quantity like pressure which evolves in time. In a mechanical system, the point in which the potential energy is minimal is called the equlibrium position; the relative position with respect to the equilibrium position is called the elongation. The maximal elongation is usually called the amplitude of oscillation.
A wave is the (result of) propagation of oscillations through an extended medium. Examples of extended media are a liquid, the vacuum (where physical fields can propagate, for example the electromagnetic field) or a discrete grid of interacting particles. Many partial differential equations for the mechanics of extended objects have wave solutions. Waves are typically viewed via quantity called amplitude which describes the relative position of each particle in a continuum system from its equilibrium position (this conflicts a bit with the terminology on oscillations, where the amplitude would be the maximnal one). The amplitude depends both on the time and the position in space. Most typical wave propagation is of the form A(x,t)=f(x−vt)A(x,t) = f(x-vt) where xx is the position, vv is the speed of propagation (which may depend on the direction of propagation, and for inhomogeneous systems on the coordinate) and tt is the time. Partial differential equations (PDE) which have wave solutions are typically parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs. Here wave solutions are recognized by their form (variations of the formula f(x−vt)f(x-vt) from above). Wave solutions can add up together linearly or not; in both cases the phenomenon is called superposition. Finite superpositions have many typical features (e.g. Lissajous figures). The superposition can stretch over infinite families of waves, then the sum passes into the integral and many periodic modes add up to something what is not periodic whatsoever, and may be even localized. One then talks about a wave packet. A wave packet can from far away look like a point particle. Wave packets can decay (damp) quickly as they propagate and in nonlinear situations can be unstable under collisions with other waves. In simple linear cases, the individual cases in the wave packet correspond to elements of a basis in a Hilbert space of functions, then the expression of a wave packet in terms of basic waves (say plane waves) amount to a case of Fourier mode expansion.
In some special circumstances, the waves can preserve their features in nonlinear situations even asymptotically after collisions, in that case we talk about solitons. Solitons and multisolitons are especially well-known in gauge theories (including the 4d case localized in time, so called instantons) and in many integrable systems like the sine-Gordon equation, KdV and the nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The inverse scattering method in those cases can be interpreted as the existence of a certain nonlinear analogue of the Fourier transform (the spectral transform) for the nonlinear wave solutions.
The quantum mechanics, when described mathematically via the solutions of a time-dependent Schroedinger equation, is a wave mechanics where the modulus square of the amplitude is interpreted as the density of probability to find the particle in the corresponding position. Linear superposition is thus one of the basic features of quantum mechanics.
Optics is the study of propagation of light, i.e. of electromagnetic waves, especially in dependence of the ambient medium, of light reflection etc.
In the limiting case of essentially plane waves (light rays) one speaks of geometrical optics.
It is practically impossible to model a macroscopic physical system in terms of the microscopic kinematical and dynamical variables of all its particles. Thus one makes a hierarchical reduction in which this complexity is reduced to a small number of collective variables. The theoretical framework for such reductions for systems is statistical mechanics or statistical physics.
One special case of hierarchical reduction is the limit of large volumes #VV, in which the number of particles (of each species) per volume, N/VN/V, stays constant. This is called the thermodynamic limit in statistical physics. Under some standard assumptions like homogeneity (spacial and possibly directional) and stability (no transitory effects), there is a small number of collective variables characterizing the system. Such a description can be (and historically was) postulated as an independent self-consistent phenomenological theory even without going into the details of statistical mechanics; such a description is called equilibrium thermodynamics, which is believed to be deducible from statistical mechanics, as has been partially proved for some classes of systems. Sometimes transitional finite-time phenomena are described either statistically by studying stochastic processes or by a more elaborate hierarchical form of thermodynamics, so-called nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
One of the basic characteristics of a thermodynamical system is its temperature, which has no analogue in fundamental non-statistical physics. Other common thermodynamical variables include pressure, volume, entropy, enthalpy etc.
While classical mechanics considers deterministic evolution of particles and fields, quantum physics follows nondeterministic evolution where the probability of various outcomes of measurement may be predicted from the state in a Hilbert space representing the possible reality: that state undergoes a unitary evolution, what means that the generator of the evolution is −1\sqrt{-1} times a Hermitean operator called the quantum Hamiltonian or the Hamiltonian operator of the system. The theoretical framework for describing this precisely is the quantum mechanics. It involves a constant of nature, Planck constant hh; some quantum systems with spatial interpretation in the limit h→0h\to 0 lead to classical mechanical systems (not all: some phenomena including non-integer spin are purely quantum mechanical, but the properties depending on their existence survive in the “classical” limit); in limited generality, one can motivate and find the nonfunctorial procedure to single out a right inverse to taking this classical limit under the name quantization.
While quantum mechanics may be formulated for a wide range of physical systems, interpreted as particles, extended particles and fields, the quantum mechanics of fields is often called the quantum field theory and the quantum mechanics of systems of a fixed finite number of particles is often viewed as the quantum mechanics in a narrow sense.
nPOV
Mathematically, despite the basic formalism of quantum mechanics which is sound and clear, there are two big areas which are yet not clear. One is to understand quantization, in all cases – of particles, fields, strings and so on. The second and possibly more central to nLab is a problem how to define rigorously a wide range of quantum field theories and some related quantum mechanical systems like the hypothetical superstring theory. Regarding that this is a central goal, we also put emphasis on the interpretation of quantum mechanics via the picture which is a special case of a FQFT, and where the time evolution functorially leads to evolution operators.
We discuss some basic notions of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanical systems
Recall the notion of a classical mechanical system: the formal dual of a real commutative Poisson algebra.

Definition
A quantum mechanical system is a star algebra (A,(−) *)(A, (-)^\ast) over the complex numbers. The category of of quantum mechanical systems is the opposite category of *\ast-algebras:
QuantMechSys:=*Alg ℂ op.
  QuantMechSys := {\ast}Alg_{\mathbb{C}}^{op}
  \,.



Remark
It makes sense to think of this as a deformed version of a real Poisson algebra as follows:


the Poisson-Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra corresponds to the commutator of the *\ast-algebra:
[a,b]:=ab−ba,
  [a,b] := a b - b a
  \,,



the commutative algebra structure of the Poisson algebra coresponds to the Jordan algebra structure of the *\ast-algebra, with commutative (but non-associative!) product
(a,b):=ab+ba.
  (a,b) := a b + b a
  \,.



With this interpretation the derivation-property of the Poisson bracket over the other product is preserved: for all a,b,c∈Aa,b,c \in A we have
[a,(b,c)]=([a,b],c)+(b,[a,c]).
  [a,(b,c)] = ([a,b],c) + (b,[a,c])
  \,.


We thus may regard a non-commutative star-algebra as a non-associative Poisson algebra : a Jordan-Lie algebra. See there for more details.

Observables and states

Definition
Given a quantum mechanical system in terms of a star algebra AA, we say


an observable is an element a∈Aa \in A such that a *=aa^\ast = a;


a state is a linear function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is positive in the sense that for all a∈Aa \in A we have ρ(aa *)≥0∈ℝ↪ℂ\rho(a a^\ast) \geq 0 \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}.




Remark
One can formalize the idea that a quantum mechanical system is like a deformed classical mechanical system as follows:
To every  *{}^\ast-algebra AA is associated its poset of commutative subalgebras Com(A)Com(A). Then the corresponding quantum mechanical system is a classical mechanical system internal to the sheaf topos Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)):


The *\ast-algebra canonically induces a commuative algebra A̲∈Sh(Com(A))\underline A \in Sh(Com(A));


the (classical) states of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) are in natural bijection with the quantum states externally on AA;


the (classical) observables of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) correspond to the external quantum observables on AA.


(…details…)

One also says that the internal classical mechanical system (Sh(Com(A)),A̲)(Sh(Com(A)), \underline{A}) is the “Bohrification” of the external quantum system AA. See there for more details.
Spaces of states
Given a *\ast-algebra AA together with a state ρ\rho on it, the GNS construction provides an inner product space H ρH_\rho together with an action of AA on H ρH_\rho and a vector Ω=(ρ)\Omega = \sqrt(\rho) – the vacuum vector? – such that for all a∈Aa \in A the value of the state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} is obtained by applying aa to ρ\sqrt{\rho} and then taking the inner product with ρ\sqrt \rho:
ρ(A)=⟨ρ,aρ⟩.
  \rho(A) = \langle \sqrt\rho, a \sqrt \rho\rangle
  \,.


If the star algebra AA happens to be a C-star algebra, then this inner product space is naturally a Hilbert space.
Historically and still often in the literature, such a Hilbert space is taken as a fundamental input of the definition of quantum systems.
Traditionally, Dirac‘s “bra-ket” notation is used to represent vectors in such Hilbert spaces of states, where |ψ⟩|\psi\rangle represents a state and ⟨ψ|\langle\psi| represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.
In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators ρ\rho, state evolution as maps of the form ρ↦U †ρU\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U for unitary maps UU, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM’s). There is a natural embedding of pure states into the space of density matrices: |ψ⟩↦|ψ⟩⟨ψ||\psi\rangle \mapsto |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|. So, one way to think of mixed states is a probabilistic mixture of pure states.
ρ=∑ ia i|ψ i⟩⟨ψ i| \rho = \sum_i a_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| 
Composite systems are formed by taking the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. If a pure state |Ψ⟩∈H 1⊗H 2|\Psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2 can be written as |ψ 1⟩⊗|ψ 2⟩|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle for |ψ i⟩∈H i|\psi_i\rangle \in H_i it is said to be separable. If no such |ψ i⟩|\psi_i\rangle exist, |Ψ⟩|\Psi\rangle is said to be entangled. If a mixed state is separable if it is the sum of separable pure states. Otherwise, it is entangled.
Flows and time evolution
As for classical mechanics, 1-parameter families of flows in a quantum mechanical system are induced from observables a∈Aa \in A by
ddλb λ=1iℏ[b λ,a].
  \frac{d}{d \lambda} b_\lambda = \frac{1}{i \hbar}[b_\lambda, a]
  \,.


In a non-relativistic system one specifies an observable HH – called the Hamiltonian – whose flow represents the time evolution of the system. (This is the Heisenberg picture.)
We comment on how to interpret this from the point of view of FQFT:
Quantum mechanics of point particles may be understood as a special case of the formalism of quantum field theory. It is interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical mechanics of point particles. Of course, we can take a configuration space of a system of particles looking like the configuration space of a single particle in a higher dimensional manifold.
Remark: related query on the relation between QFT and quantum mechanics (of particles and in general) can be found here.
One may usefully think of the quantum mechanics of a point particle propagating on a manifold XX as being (0+1)(0+1)-dimensional quantum field theory:
the fields of this system are maps Σ→X\Sigma \to X where Σ∈RiemBord 1\Sigma \in Riem Bord_1 are 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold cobordisms. These are the trajectories of the particle.
After quantization this yields a 1-dimensional FQFT given by a functor
U(−):RiemBord 1→Hilb
  U(-) : Riem Bord_1 \to Hilb


from cobordisms to Hilbert spaces (or some other flavor of vector spaces) that assigns


to the point the space of states ℋ\mathcal{H}, typically the space of L 2L_2-sections (with respect to a Riemannian metric on XX) of the background gauge field on XX under which the particle in question is charged


to the cobordism of Riemannian length tt the operator
U(t):=exp(tiℏH):ℋ→ℋ,
  U(t) := \exp\left(\frac{t}{i \hbar } H \right)
  : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
  \,,


where HH is the Hamiltonian operator, typically of the form H=∇ †∘∇H = \nabla^\dagger \circ \nabla  for ∇\nabla the covariant derivative of the given background gauge field.


Such a setup describes the quantum mechanics of a particle that feels forces of backgound gravity encoded in the Riemannian metric on XX and forces of background gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) encoded in the covariant derivative ∇\nabla.
(This is the Schrödinger picture.)
Quantum subsystems

Definition
For 𝒜\mathcal{A} an algebra describing a quantum system, def. , a subsystem is a subalgebra (a subobject) B↪𝒜B \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}.
Two subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A} are called independent subsystems if the linear map
B 1⊗B 2→𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \to \mathcal{A}

(b 1,b 2)↦b 1⋅b 2  
  (b_1, b_2) \mapsto b_1 \cdot b_2


from the tensor product of algebras (the composite system) factors as an isomorphism
B 1⊗B 2→≃B 1∨B 2↪𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B_1 \vee B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}


through the algebra B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that is generated by B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 inside 𝒜\mathcal{A} (the smallest subalgebra containing both).

See for instance (BrunettiFredenhagen, section 5.2.2).

Definition
Given two independent subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}, and two states ρ 1:B 1→ℂ\rho_1 : B_1 \to \mathbb{C} and ρ 2:B 2→ℂ\rho_2 : B_2 \to \mathbb{C}, then the corresponding product state ρ 1⊗ρ 2\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 is defined to be
(ρ 1⊗ρ 2):(b 1,b 2)↦ρ 1(b 1)ρ 2(b 2).
  (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) : 
  (b_1 , b_2) \mapsto \rho_1(b_1) \rho_2(b_2)
  \,.



Definition
There exist states on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that are not (convex combinations of) product states. This phenomenon is called entanglement.

Central aspects of quantum mechanics with finite-dimensional spaces of quantum states — such as tensor products of qbit states of relevance in quantum information theory and quantum computation — follow from the formal properties of the category FinHilb of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These properties are axiomatized by saying that FinHilb is an example of a †-compact category.
Conversely, much of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics and quantum computation can be formulated in any †-compact category, and general reasoning about †-compact categories themselves yields results about quantum mechanics and quantum computation.
A transparent string diagram calculus in †-compact categories as exposed in (Coecke, Kindergarten quantum mechanics) provides an intuitive and powerful tool for reasoning in †\dagger-compact categories.
Quantum information refers to data that can be physically stored in a quantum system.
Quantum information theory is the study of how such information can be encoded, measured, and manipulated. A notable sub-field is quantum computation, a term often used synonymously with quantum information theory, which studies protocols and algorithms that use quantum systems to perform computations.
Categorical quantum information refers to a program in which the cogent aspects of Hilbert space-based quantum information theory are abstracted to the level of symmetric monoidal categories.
Given a Poisson manifold (X,{−,−})(X, \{-,-\}) and a vector field v∈Γ(TX)v \in \Gamma(T X) , a Hamiltonian for vv is a smooth function h v∈C ∞(X)h_v \in C^\infty(X) such that {h v,−}\{h_v,-\} is the derivation corresponding to vv.
Conversely, one says that vv is the Hamiltonian vector field of h vh_v.
In quantum mechanics a density matrix is a linear endomorphism of a Hilbert space of pure quantum states that represents a statistical ensemble of quantum states, hence states which are not necessarily pure states but mixed states.
The space of density matrices inside all suitable endomorphisms is called the Bloch region.
In quantum mechanics, the Kochen-Specker theorem – developed in 1967 by Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker – is a no-go theorem that places limits on the types of hidden variable theories that may be used to explain the (apparent) probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics in a causal way. It roughly asserts that it is impossible to assign values to all physical observables while simultaneously preserving the functional relations between them. It is a complement to Bell's theorem, developed by John Bell in 1964, and is related to Gleason's theorem, proven by (Gleason (1957)) (who incidentally is the person who communicated the original Kochen-Specker paper to the Journal of Mathematics and Mechanics ). Later in (Butterfield-Hamilton-Isham 98) it was observed that the Kochen-Specker theorem is equivalent to the statement that the spectral presheaf has no global elements, which led to the proposal that the phase space in quantum mechanics is naturally to be understood as a (ringed) topos, the “Bohr topos”.
Bell’s theorem is the collective name for a family of results, all showing the impossibility of a Local Realistic (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such, it is a form of a no-go theorem and is related to


the Kochen-Specker theorem and


Gleason's theorem.


Original derivation

The following tries to be a fairly verbatim recap of the argument in Bell 1964. For a streamlined statement and proof see here at Bell's inequality.

Let us denote the result A of a measurement that is determined by a unit vector, a→\vec{a}, and some parameter λ\lambda as A(a→,λ)=±1A(\vec{a},\lambda)=\pm 1 where we further suppose that the outcome of the measurement is either +1 or -1. Likewise, we may do the same for the result B of a second measurement, i.e. B(b→,λ)B(\vec{b},\lambda). We further make the vital assumption that the result B does not depend on a→\vec{a} and likewise A does not depend on b→\vec{b}.
Before proceeding, we should note that λ\lambda here plays the role of a “hidden” parameter or variable. We say it is “hidden” because its precise nature is not known. However, it is still a very real parameter with a probability distribution ρ(λ)\rho(\lambda). The expectation value of the product of the two measurements is
P(a→,b→)=∫dλρ(λ)A(a→,λ)B(b→,λ).
  P(\vec{a},\vec{b})=\int d\lambda\rho(\lambda)A(\vec{a},\lambda)B(\vec{b},\lambda).


Because ρ\rho is a normalized probability distribution,
∫dλρ(λ)=1
  \int d\lambda \rho(\lambda) = 1


and because A(a→,λ)=±1A(\vec{a},\lambda)=\pm 1 and B(b→,λ)=±1B(\vec{b},\lambda)=\pm 1, P cannot be less than -1. It can be equal to -1 at a→=b→\vec{a}=\vec{b} only if A(a→,λ)=±1=−B(a→,λ)=±1A(\vec{a},\lambda)=\pm 1 = -B(\vec{a},\lambda)=\pm 1 except at a set of points λ\lambda of zero probability. Thus we can write (1) as
P(a→,b→)=−∫dλρ(λ)A(a→,λ)A(b→,λ).
  P(\vec{a},\vec{b})=-\int d\lambda\rho(\lambda)A(\vec{a},\lambda)A(\vec{b},\lambda).


If we introduce a third unit vector c→\vec{c} we can find the difference between the correlation of a→\vec{a} to the two other unit vectors,
P(a→,b→)−P(a→,c→)=−∫dλρ(λ)[A(a→,λ)A(b→,λ)−A(a→,λ)A(c→,λ)].
  P(\vec{a},\vec{b})-P(\vec{a},\vec{c})=-\int d\lambda\rho(\lambda)[A(\vec{a},\lambda)A(\vec{b},\lambda)-A(\vec{a},\lambda)A(\vec{c},\lambda)].


Rearranging this we may write (3) as
P(a→,b→)−P(a→,c→)=−∫dλρ(λ)A(a→,λ)A(b→,λ)[A(b→,λ)A(c→,λ)−1].
  P(\vec{a},\vec{b})-P(\vec{a},\vec{c})=-\int d\lambda\rho(\lambda)A(\vec{a},\lambda)A(\vec{b},\lambda)[A(\vec{b},\lambda)A(\vec{c},\lambda)-1].


Given the limitations we have placed on the value of A, we may write
|P(a→,b→)−P(a→,c→)|≤∫dλρ(λ)[1−A(b→,λ)A(c→,λ)].
  |P(\vec{a},\vec{b})-P(\vec{a},\vec{c})| \le \int d\lambda\rho(\lambda)[1-A(\vec{b},\lambda)A(\vec{c},\lambda)].


But the second term on the right is simply P(b→,c→)P(\vec{b},\vec{c}) and thus
1+P(b→,c→)≥|P(a→,b→)−P(a→,c→)|
  1 + P(\vec{b},\vec{c}) \ge |P(\vec{a},\vec{b})-P(\vec{a},\vec{c})|


which is the original form of Bell’s inequality. Note that this may be written in terms of correlation coefficients,
1+C(b,c)≥|C(a,b)−C(a,c)|
  1 + C(b,c) \ge |C(a,b)-C(a,c)|


where a, b, and c are now settings on the measurement apparatus.
Quantum mechanical violations
The original derivation of Bell’s inequalities involved the use of a Stern-Gerlach device that measures spin along an axis. Suppose σ 1\sigma_{1} and σ 2\sigma_{2} are spins. The result, A, of measuring σ 1⋅a→\sigma_{1}\cdot\vec{a} is then interpreted as being entirely determined by a→\vec{a} and λ\lambda. Likewise for B and σ 2⋅b→\sigma_{2}\cdot\vec{b}. It is also important to remember that the result B does not depend on a→\vec{a} and likewise A does not depend on b→\vec{b}.
For a singlet state (that is a state with total spin of zero), the quantum mechanical expectation value of measurements along two different axes (see the Wigner derivation below for a more intuitive explanation of the physical nature of this) is
⟨σ 1⋅a→,σ 2⋅b→⟩=−a→⋅b→.
  \langle\sigma_{1}\cdot\vec{a},\sigma_{2}\cdot\vec{b}\rangle = - \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}.


In theory this ought to equal P(a→,b→)P(\vec{a},\vec{b}) but in practice it does not. It is important to remember that we are using classical reasoning throughout our derivations of the various forms of Bell’s inequalities.
The setup envisioned here consists of pairs of spin-1/2 particles produced in singlet states that then each pass through separate Stern-Gerlach (SG) devices. Since they are in singlet states, if we measured the first particle of a pair to be aligned with a given axis, say a→\vec{a}, then the second should be measured to be anti-aligned with that same axis, giving a total spin of zero.
In practice we are dealing with beams of particles and thus we can never be absolutely certain that correlated pairs are measured simultaneously and so we ultimately are making statistical predictions. Nevertheless, in a given sample consisting of a large-enough number of randomly distributed spin-1/2 particles, we can be certain that, for example, a definite number are aligned with an axis a→\vec{a} while a definite number are aligned with an axis b→\vec{b}.
Now take an individual particle and suppose that, for this particle, if we measured σ⋅a→\sigma\cdot\vec{a} we would obtain a +1 with certainty (meaning it is aligned with a→\vec{a}) but if we instead chose to measure σ⋅b→\sigma\cdot\vec{b} we would obtain a -1 with certainty (meaning it is anti-aligned with b→\vec{b}). Notationally we refer to such a particle as belonging to type (a→+,b→−)(\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-). Clearly for a given pair of particles in a singlet state, if particle 1 is of type (a→+,b→−)(\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-), then particle 2 must be of type (a→−,b→+)(\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+).
Locality
For beams of correlated particles measuring along only two axes, we should expect to get a roughly evenly balanced distribution of types as follows:
 Particle 1    Particle 2  (a→+,b→−) ↔ (a→−,b→+) (a→+,b→+) ↔ (a→−,b→−) (a→−,b→−) ↔ (a→+,b→+) (a→−,b→+) ↔ (a→+,b→−)
\array{
\text{ Particle 1 } & & \text{ Particle 2 } \\
(\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-) & \leftrightarrow & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+) \\
(\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+) & \leftrightarrow & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-) \\
(\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-) & \leftrightarrow & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+) \\
(\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+) & \leftrightarrow & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-)
}


There is a very important assumption implied here. Suppose a particular pair belongs to the first grouping, that is if an observer A decides to measure the spin along a→\vec{a} for particle 1, he or she necessarily obtains a plus sign (corresponding to it being aligned with a→\vec{a}) regardless of any measurement observer B may make on particle 2. This is the principle of locality: A’s result is predetermined independently of B’s choice of what to measure.
Wigner’s derivation
Now suppose we introduce a third axis, c→\vec{c}, so that we can have, for example, particles of type (a→+,b→+,c→−)(\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+,\vec{c}-) corresponding to being aligned if measured on a→\vec{a} and b→\vec{b} and anti-aligned on c→\vec{c}. Further let us “count” the pairs that fall into the various groupings and label the populations as follows:
 Population   Particle 1   Particle 2  N 1 (a→+,b→+,c→+) (a→−,b→−,c→−) N 2 (a→+,b→+,c→−) (a→−,b→−,c→+) N 3 (a→+,b→−,c→+) (a→−,b→+,c→−) N 4 (a→+,b→−,c→−) (a→−,b→+,c→+) N 5 (a→−,b→+,c→+) (a→+,b→−,c→−) N 6 (a→−,b→+,c→−) (a→+,b→−,c→+) N 7 (a→−,b→−,c→+) (a→+,b→+,c→−) N 8 (a→−,b→−,c→−) (a→+,b→+,c→+)
\array{
\text{ Population } & \text{ Particle 1 } & \text{ Particle 2 } \\
N_{1} & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+, \vec{c}+) & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-,\vec{c}-) \\
N_{2} & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+, \vec{c}-) & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-,\vec{c}+) \\
N_{3} & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-, \vec{c}+) & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+,\vec{c}-) \\
N_{4} & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-, \vec{c}-) & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+,\vec{c}+) \\
N_{5} & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+, \vec{c}+) & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-,\vec{c}-) \\
N_{6} & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}+, \vec{c}-) & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}-,\vec{c}+) \\
N_{7} & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-, \vec{c}+) & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+,\vec{c}-) \\
N_{8} & (\vec{a}-,\vec{b}-, \vec{c}-) & (\vec{a}+,\vec{b}+,\vec{c}+)
}


Let’s suppose that observer A finds particle 1 is aligned with a→\vec{a}, i.e. a→+\vec{a}+, and that observer B finds particle 2 is aligned with b→\vec{b}, i.e. b→+\vec{b}+. From the above table it is clear that the pair belong to either population 3 or 4. Note that because N iN_{i} is positive semi-definite we must be able to construct relations like, for instance,
N 3+N 4≤(N 3+N 7)+(N 4+N 2).
N_{3} + N_{4} \le (N_{3} + N_{7}) + (N_{4} + N_{2}).


Now let P(a→+;b→+)P(\vec{a}+;\vec{b}+) be the probability that, in a random selection, A finds particle 1 to be a→+\vec{a}+ and B finds particle 2 to be b→+\vec{b}+. In terms of populations, we have
P(a→+;b→+)=(N 3+N 4)∑ i 8N i.
  P(\vec{a}+;\vec{b}+) = \frac{(N_{3} + N_{4})}{\sum_{i}^{8}N_{i}}.


Similarly we have
P(a→+;c→+)=(N 2+N 4)∑ i 8N i
  P(\vec{a}+;\vec{c}+) = \frac{(N_{2} + N_{4})}{\sum_{i}^{8}N_{i}}


and
P(c→+;b→+)=(N 3+N 7)∑ i 8N i.
  P(\vec{c}+;\vec{b}+) = \frac{(N_{3} + N_{7})}{\sum_{i}^{8}N_{i}}.


The positivity condition (9) then becomes
P(a→+;b→+)≤P(a→+;c→+)+P(c→+;b→+).
P(\vec{a}+;\vec{b}+) \le P(\vec{a}+;\vec{c}+) + P(\vec{c}+;\vec{b}+).


This is Wigner’s form of Bell’s inequality.
Violations and geometry
As we mentioned before, we have used purely classical reasoning to derive the two forms of Bell’s inequality that we have thusfar encountered. Recall that the context within which the above were derived was the Stern-Gerlach experiment are we are measuring along axes of the magnetic field. As such, there are angles between these various axes. Thus the quantum mechanically-derived probabilities corresponding to (10), (11), and (12) are
P(a→+;b→+)=12sin 2(θ ab2),
  P(\vec{a}+;\vec{b}+) = \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{ab}}{2}\right),


P(a→+;c→+)=12sin 2(θ ac2),
  P(\vec{a}+;\vec{c}+) = \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{ac}}{2}\right),


and
P(c→+;b→+)=12sin 2(θ cb2),
  P(\vec{c}+;\vec{b}+) = \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{cb}}{2}\right),


respectively. Bell’s inequality, (13), then becomes
12sin 2(θ ab2)≤12sin 2(θ ac2)+12sin 2(θ cb2).
  \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{ab}}{2}\right) \le \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{ac}}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}sin^{2}\left(\frac{\theta_{cb}}{2}\right).


From a geometric point of view, this inequality is not always possible. For example, suppose, for simplicity that a→\vec{a}, b→\vec{b}, and c→\vec{c} lie in a plane and suppose that c→\vec{c} bisects a→\vec{a} and b→\vec{b}, i.e.
θ ab=2θ  and  θ ac=θ cb=θ.
\array{
  \theta_{ab} = 2\theta & \text{ and } & \theta_{ac}=\theta_{cb}=\theta.
}


Then (14) is violated for 0<θ<π20 \lt \theta \lt \frac{\pi}{2}. For example, if θ=π4\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}, (14) would become 0.500≤0.2920.500 \le 0.292 which is absurd!
General
The classical Gleason theorem says that a state on the C*-algebra ℬ(ℋ)\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H}) of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space is uniquely described by the values it takes on the orthogonal projections 𝒫\mathcal{P}, if the dimension of the Hilbert space ℋ\mathcal{H} is not 2.
In other words: every quasi-state is already a state if dim(H)>2dim(H) \gt 2.
It is possible to extend the theorem to certain types of von Neumann algebras (e.g. obviously factors of type I 2I_2 have to be excluded).
Gleason’s theorem is also valid for real and quaternionic Hilbert spaces as proved by Varadarajan in 1968. A gap of that proof has been fixed in 2018 by V.Moretti and M.Oppio.
Implications for Quantum Logic
Roughly, Gleason’s theorem says that “a quantum state is completely determined by only knowing the answers to all of the possible yes/no questions”.
By quantization is meant some process that


reads in a system of classical mechanics, or rather of prequantum data in the form of an Lagrangian/action functional and or a phase space equipped with symplectic structure


and returns a corresponding system of quantum mechanics.


Motivation from classical mechanics and Lie theory
We indicate here a systematic motivation of quantization by looking at classical mechanics formalized as symplectic geometry from the point of view of Lie theory (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13, Nuiten 13).
\,
Quantization of course was and is motivated by experiment, hence by observation of the observable universe: it just so happens that quantum mechanics and quantum field theory correctly account for experimental observations where classical mechanics and classical field theory gives no answer or incorrect answers. A historically important example is the phenomenon called the “ultraviolet catastrophe”, a paradox predicted by classical statistical mechanics which is not observed in nature, and which is corrected by quantum mechanics.
But one may also ask, independently of experimental input, if there are good formal mathematical reasons and motivations to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. Could one have been led to quantum mechanics by just pondering the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics? (Hence more precisely: is there a natural Synthetic Quantum Field Theory?)
The following spells out an argument to this effect. It will work for readers with a background in modern mathematics, notably in Lie theory, and with an understanding of the formalization of classical/prequantum mechanics in terms of symplectic geometry.
So to briefly recall, a system of classical mechanics/prequantum mechanics is a phase space, formalized as a symplectic manifold (X,ω)(X, \omega). A symplectic manifold is in particular a Poisson manifold, which means that the algebra of functions on phase space XX, hence the algebra of classical observables, is canonically equipped with a compatible Lie bracket: the Poisson bracket. This Lie bracket is what controls dynamics in classical mechanics. For instance if H∈C ∞(X)H \in C^\infty(X) is the function on phase space which is interpreted as assigning to each configuration of the system its energy – the Hamiltonian function – then the Poisson bracket with HH yields the infinitesimal time evolution of the system: the differential equation famous as Hamilton's equations.
Something to take notice of here is the infinitesimal nature of the Poisson bracket. Generally, whenever one has a Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, then it is to be regarded as the infinitesimal approximation to a globally defined object, the corresponding Lie group (or generally smooth group) GG. One also says that GG is a Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} and that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is the Lie differentiation of GG.
Therefore a natural question to ask is: Since the observables in classical mechanics form a Lie algebra under Poisson bracket, what then is the corresponding Lie group?
The answer to this is of course “well known” in the literature, in the sense that there are relevant monographs which state the answer. But, maybe surprisingly, the answer to this question is not (at time of this writing) a widely advertized fact that has found its way into the basic educational textbooks. The answer is that this Lie group which integrates the Poisson bracket is the “quantomorphism group”, an object that seamlessly leads to the quantum mechanics of the system.
Before we spell this out in more detail, we need a brief technical aside: of course Lie integration is not quite unique. There may be different global Lie group objects with the same Lie algebra.
The simplest example of this is already one of central importance for the issue of quantization, namely, the Lie integration of the abelian line Lie algebra ℝ\mathbb{R}. This has essentially two different Lie groups associated with it: the simply connected translation group, which is just ℝ\mathbb{R} itself again, equipped with its canonical additive abelian group structure, and the discrete quotient of this by the group of integers, which is the circle group
U(1)=ℝ/ℤ.
  U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


Notice that it is the discrete and hence “quantized” nature of the integers that makes the real line become a circle here. This is not entirely a coincidence of terminology, but can be traced back to the heart of what is “quantized” about quantum mechanics.
Namely, one finds that the Poisson bracket Lie algebra 𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)\mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) of the classical observables on phase space is (for XX a connected manifold) a Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra 𝔥𝔞𝔪(X)\mathfrak{ham}(X) of Hamiltonian vector fields on XX by the line Lie algebra:
ℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X).
  \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X)
  \,.


This means that under Lie integration the Poisson bracket turns into an central extension of the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of (X,ω)(X,\omega). And either it is the fairly trivial non-compact extension by ℝ\mathbb{R}, or it is the interesting central extension by the circle group U(1)U(1). For this non-trivial Lie integration to exist, (X,ω)(X,\omega) needs to satisfy a quantization condition which says that it admits a prequantum line bundle. If so, then this U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group Ham(X,ω)Ham(X,\omega) of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms exists and is called… the quantomorphism group QuantMorph(X,ω)QuantMorph(X,\omega):
U(1)⟶QuantMorph(X,ω)⟶Ham(X,ω).
  U(1) \longrightarrow QuantMorph(X,\omega) \longrightarrow Ham(X,\omega)
  \,.


While important, for some reason this group is not very well known, which is striking because it contains a small subgroup which is famous in quantum mechanics: the Heisenberg group.
More precisely, whenever (X,ω)(X,\omega) itself has a compatible group structure, notably if (X,ω)(X,\omega) is just a symplectic vector space (regarded as a group under addition of vectors), then we may ask for the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which covers the (left) action of phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega) on itself. This is the corresponding Heisenberg group Heis(X,ω)Heis(X,\omega), which in turn is a U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group XX itself:
U(1)⟶Heis(X,ω)⟶X.
  U(1) \longrightarrow Heis(X,\omega) \longrightarrow X
  \,.


At this point it is worth pausing for a second to note how the hallmark of quantum mechanics has appeared as if out of nowhere simply by applying Lie integration to the Lie algebraic structures in classical mechanics:
if we think of Lie integrating ℝ\mathbb{R} to the interesting circle group U(1)U(1) instead of to the uninteresting translation group ℝ\mathbb{R}, then the name of its canonical basis element 1∈ℝ1 \in \mathbb{R} is canonically “ii”, the imaginary unit. Therefore one often writes the above central extension instead as follows:
iℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X,ω)
  i \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X,\omega)


in order to amplify this. But now consider the simple special case where (X,ω)=(ℝ 2,dp∧dq)(X,\omega) = (\mathbb{R}^2, d p \wedge d q) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space which is for instance the phase space of the particle propagating on the line. Then a canonical set of generators for the corresponding Poisson bracket Lie algebra consists of the linear functions pp and qq of classical mechanics textbook fame, together with the constant function. Under the above Lie theoretic identification, this constant function is the canonical basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R}, hence purely Lie theoretically it is to be called “ii”.
With this notation then the Poisson bracket, written in the form that makes its Lie integration manifest, indeed reads
[q,p]=i.
  [q,p] = i
  \,.


Since the choice of basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R} is arbitrary, we may rescale here the ii by any non-vanishing real number without changing this statement. If we write “ℏ\hbar” for this element, then the Poisson bracket instead reads
[q,p]=iℏ.
  [q,p] = i \hbar
  \,.


This is of course the hallmark equation for quantum physics, if we interpret ℏ\hbar here indeed as Planck's constant. We see it arises here merely by considering the non-trivial (the interesting, the non-simply connected) Lie integration of the Poisson bracket.
This is only the beginning of the story of quantization, naturally understood and indeed “derived” from applying Lie theory to classical mechanics. From here the story continues. It is called the story of geometric quantization. We close this motivation section here by some brief outlook.
The quantomorphism group which is the non-trivial Lie integration of the Poisson bracket is naturally constructed as follows: given the symplectic form ω\omega, it is natural to ask if it is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)U(1)-principal connection ∇\nabla on complex line bundle LL over XX (this is directly analogous to Dirac charge quantization when instead of a symplectic form on phase space we consider the the field strength 2-form of electromagnetism on spacetime). If so, such a connection (L,∇)(L, \nabla) is called a prequantum line bundle of the phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega). The quantomorphism group is simply the automorphism group of the prequantum line bundle, covering diffeomorphisms of the phase space (the Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms mentioned above).
As such, the quantomorphism group naturally acts on the space of sections of LL. Such a section is like a wavefunction, except that it depends on all of phase space, instead of just on the “canonical coordinates”. For purely abstract mathematical reasons (which we won’t discuss here, but see at motivic quantization for more) it is indeed natural to choose a “polarization” of phase space into canonical coordinates and canonical momenta and consider only those sections of the prequantum line bundle which depend only on the former. These are the actual wavefunctions of quantum mechanics, hence the quantum states. And the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which preserves these polarized sections is the group of exponentiated quantum observables. For instance in the simple case mentioned before where (X,ω)(X,\omega) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space, this is the Heisenberg group with its famous action by multiplication and differentiation operators on the space of complex-valued functions on the real line.
Quantization of field theory
An interesting subclass of quantum field theories, especially of perturbative quantum field theories, is thought to arise from prequantum field theory via a process of quantization. This process reads in certain – usually differential geometric – data (Lagrangian field theory), interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some physical system, and spits out the perturbative quantum field theory that encodes the time evolution of this system.
For more on this see at Wick algebra and causal perturbation theory.
Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as “classical physics”. The true dynamics in turn is “quantum physics”.
In view of this, quantization is often understood as a right inverse to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its classical limit. As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists. Additional structures sometimes make it unique.

These traditional formulations are geared towards mechanics (as opposed to field theory). Even in that restricted application, it seems that a more comprehensive understanding is still missing

The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of quantization.
(Gukov-Witten 08, p.4)

In the context of field theory the conceptual issues become even more severe. For example the class of field theories called Yang-Mills theory is a core ingredient in the standard model of particle physics but the quantization of Yang-Mills theory (see there for more) poses famous open problems – of which of course that there isn’t yet a comprehensive theory of what this even means is not the least.
Geometric quantization is one formalization of the notion of quantization of a classical mechanical system/classical field theory to a quantum mechanical system/quantum field theory. In comparison to deformation quantization it focuses on spaces of states, hence on the Schrödinger picture of quantum mechanics.
Ingredients
With a symplectic manifold regarded as a classical mechanical system, geometric quantization produces quantization of this to a quantum mechanical system by


realize the symplectic form as the curvature of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection (which requires the form to have integral periods): called the prequantum circle bundle;


choose a polarization – a splitting of the abstract phase space into “coordinates” and “momenta”;


and then form


a Hilbert space of states as the space of sections of the associated line bundle which depend only on the “coordinates” (not on the “momenta”);


associate with every function on the symplectic manifold – every Hamiltonian – a linear operator on this Hilbert space.


History and variants
The approach is due to Alexandre Kirillov (“orbit method”), Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau. See the References below. It is closely related to Berezin quantization? and the subject of coherent states.

(Souriau 74, fig 1)
In a long term project Alan Weinstein and many of his students have followed the idea that the true story behind geometric quantization crucially involves symplectic Lie groupoids: higher symplectic geometry. See geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids for more on this.
More generally, there is higher geometric quantization.
Overview

This overview is taken from (Baez).

Geometric quantization is a tool for understanding the relation between classical physics and quantum physics. Here’s a brief sketch of how it goes.


We start with a classical phase space: mathematically, this is a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega.


Then we do prequantization: this gives us a Hermitian line bundle LL over XX, equipped with a U(1)U(1) connection DD whose curvature equals iωi \omega. LL is called the prequantum line bundle.
Warning: we can only do this step if ω\omega satisfies the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition, which says that ω/2π\omega/2\pi defines an integral cohomology class. If this condition holds, LL and DD are determined up to isomorphism, but not canonically.


The Hilbert space H 0H_0 of square-integrable sections of LL is called the prequantum Hilbert space. This is not yet the Hilbert space of our quantized theory – it’s too big. But it’s a good step in the right direction. In particular, we can prequantize classical observables: there’s a map sending any smooth function on XX to an operator on H 0H_0. This map takes Poisson brackets to commutators, just as one would hope. The formula for this map involves the connection DD.


To cut down the prequantum Hilbert space, we need to choose a polarization, say PP. What’s this? Well, for each point x∈Xx \in X, a polarization picks out a certain subspace P xP_x of the complexified tangent space at xx. We define the quantum Hilbert space, HH, to be the space of all square-integrable sections of LL that give zero when we take their covariant derivative at any point xx in the direction of any vector in P xP_x. The quantum Hilbert space is a subspace of the prequantum Hilbert space.
Warning: for PP to be a polarization, there are some crucial technical conditions we impose on the subspaces P xP_x. First, they must be isotropic: the complexified symplectic form ω\omega must vanish on them. Second, they must be Lagrangian: they must be maximal isotropic subspaces. Third, they must vary smoothly with xx. And fourth, they must be integrable.


The easiest sort of polarization to understand is a real polarization. This is where the subspaces P xP_x come from subspaces of the tangent space by complexification. It boils down to this: a real polarization is an integrable distribution PP on the classical phase space where each space P xP_x is Lagrangian subspace of the tangent space T xXT_x X.


To understand this rigamarole, one must study examples! First, it’s good to understand how good old Schrödinger quantization fits into this framework. Remember, in Schrödinger quantization we take our classical phase space XX to be the cotangent bundle T *MT^* M of a manifold MM called the classical configuration space. We then let our quantum Hilbert space be the space of all square-integrable functions on MM.
Modulo some technical trickery, we get this example when we run the above machinery and use a certain god-given real polarization on X=T *MX = T^*M, namely the one given by the vertical vectors.


It’s also good to study the Bargmann–Segal representation, which we get by taking X=ℂ nX = \mathbb{C}^n with its god-given symplectic structure (the imaginary part of the inner product) and using the god-given Kähler polarization. When we do this, our quantum Hilbert space consists of analytic functions on ℂ n\mathbb{C}^n which are square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure centered at the origin.


The next step is to quantize classical observables, turning them into linear operators on the quantum Hilbert space HH. Unfortunately, we can’t quantize all such observables while still sending Poisson brackets to commutators, as we did at the prequantum level. So at this point things get trickier and my brief outline will stop. Ultimately, the reason for this problem is that quantization is not a functor from the category of symplectic manifolds to the category of Hilbert spaces – but for that one needs to learn a bit about category theory.


Basic Jargon
Here are some definitions of important terms. Unfortunately they are defined using other terms that you might not understand. If you are really mystified, you need to read some books on differential geometry and the math of classical mechanics before proceeding.


complexification: We can tensor a real vector space with the complex numbers and get a complex vector space; this process is called complexification. For example, we can complexify the tangent space at some point of a manifold, which amounts to forming the space of complex linear combinations of tangent vectors at that point.


distribution: The word “distribution” means many different things in mathematics, but here’s one: a “distribution” VV on a manifold XX is a choice of a subspace V xV_x of each tangent space T pXT_p X, where the choice depends smoothly on xx.


Hamiltonian vector field: Given a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega, any smooth function f:X→ℝf: X \to \mathbb{R} can be thought of as a “Hamiltonian”, meaning physically that we think of it as the energy function and let it give rise to a flow on XX describing the time evolution of states. Mathematically speaking, this flow is generated by a vector field v(f)v(f) called the “Hamiltonian vector field” associated to ff. It is the unique vector field such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-, v(f)) = d f


In other words, for any vector field uu on XX we have
ω(u,v(f))=df(u)=uf
  \omega(u,v(f)) = d f(u) = u f


The vector field v(f)v(f) is guaranteed to exist by the fact that ω\omega is nondegenerate.


integrable distribution: A distribution of subspaces of the tangent bundle on a smooth manifold XX is “integrable” if at least locally, there is a foliation of XX by submanifolds such that V xV_x is the tangent space of the submanifold containing the point xx.


integral cohomology class: Any closed differential p-form on a smooth manifold MM defines an element of the ppth de Rham cohomology of MM. This is a finite-dimensional vector space, and it contains a lattice called the ppth integral cohomology group of MM. We say a cohomology class is integral if it lies in this lattice. Most notably, if you take any U(1)U(1) connection on any Hermitian line bundle over MM, its curvature 22-form will define an integral cohomology class once you divide it by 2πi2 \pi i. This cohomology class is called the first Chern class, and it serves to determine the line bundle up to isomorphism.


Poisson brackets: Given a symplectic structure on a manifold MM and given two smooth functions on that manifold, say ff and gg, there’s a trick for getting a new smooth function {f,g}\{f,g\} on the manifold, called the Poisson bracket of ff and gg.
This trick works as follows: given any smooth function ff we can take its differential dfd f, which is a 11-form. Then there is a unique vector field v(f)v(f), the Hamiltonian vector field associated to ff, such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-,v(f)) = d f


Using this we define
{f,g}=ω(v(f),v(g))
   \{f,g\} = \omega(v(f),v(g))
 

It’s easy to check that we also have {f,g}=dg(v(f))=v(f)g\{f,g\} = d g(v(f)) = v(f) g. So {f,g}\{f,g\} says how much gg changes as we differentiate it in the direction of the Hamiltonian vector field generated by ff.
In the familiar case where MM is ℝ 2n\mathbb{R}^{2n} with momentum and position coordinates p ip_i, q iq_i, the Poisson brackets of ff and gg work out to be
{f,g}=∑ idfdp idgdq i−dfdq idgdp i
   \{f,g\} = \sum_i \frac{d f}{d p_i} \frac{d g}{d q_i} - \frac{d f}{d q_i}\frac{d g}{d p_i}
 


square-integrable sections: We can define an inner product on the sections of a Hermitian line bundle over a manifold XX with a symplectic structure. The symplectic structure defines a volume form which lets us do the necessary integral. A section whose inner product with itself is finite is said to be square-integrable. Such sections form a Hilbert space H 0H_0 called the “prequantum Hilbert space”. It is a kind of preliminary version of the Hilbert space we get when we quantize the classical system whose phase space is XX.


symplectic structure: A symplectic structure on a manifold MM is a closed 22-form ω\omega which is nondegenerate in the sense that for any nonzero tangent vector uu at any point of MM, there is a tangent vector uu at that point for which w(u,v)w(u,v) is nonzero.


U(1)U(1) connection: The group U(1)U(1) is the group of unit complex numbers. Given a complex line bundle LL with an inner product on each fiber L xL_x, a U(1)U(1) connection on LL is a connection such that parallel translation preserves the inner product.


vertical vectors: Given a bundle EE over a manifold MM, we say a tangent vector to some point of EE is vertical if it projects to zero down on MM.


Geometric quantization involves two steps


Geometric prequantization


Geometric quantization proper.


Geometric prequantization
Prequantum line bundle
Given the symplectic form ω\omega, a prequantum circle bundle for it is a circle bundle with connection whose curvature is ω\omega.
In other words, prequantization is a lift of ω\omega through the curvature-exact sequence of ordinary differential cohomology (see there).
The multiple of the Chern class of this line bundle is identified with the inverse Planck constant.
Prequantum states
A prequantum state is a section of the prequantum bundle.
This becomes a quantum state or wavefunction if polarized (…).
Prequantum operators
Let ∇:X→BU(1) conn\nabla : X \to \mathbf{B} U(1)_{conn} be a prequantum line bundle E→XE \to X with connection for ω\omega. Write Γ X(E)\Gamma_X(E) for its space of smooth sections, the prequantum space of states.

Definition
(prequantum operators)
For f∈C ∞(X,ℂ)f \in C^\infty(X, \mathbb{C}) a function on phase space, the corresponding quantum operator is the linear map
f^:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)
  \hat f \colon \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)


given by
(1)ψ↦−i∇ v fψ+f⋅ψ,
  
  \psi \mapsto -i \nabla_{v_f} \psi + f \cdot \psi
  \,,


where


v fv_f is the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to ff;


∇ v f:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)\nabla_{v_f} : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the covariant derivative of sections along v fv_f for the given choice of prequantum connection;


f⋅(−):Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)f \cdot (-) : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the operation of degreewise multiplication pf sections.




Remark
(origin of the formulas for prequantum operators)+
The formula (1) may look a bit mysterious on first sight. The correction term to the covariant derivative appearing in this formula is ultimately due to the fact that with vv the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to a Hamiltonian H vH_v via
ι vω=dH v
  \iota_v \omega = d H_v


then the Lie derivative of θ\theta (the symplectic potentiation, related by dθ=ωd \theta = \omega) is
ℒ vθ=dH˜ v
  \mathcal{L}_v \theta = d \tilde H_v


for
H˜ v=H v+ι vθ.
  \tilde H_v = H_v + \iota_v \theta
  \,.


Here the second term on the right is what yields the covariant derivative in (1), while the first summand is the correction term in (1).
A derivation of these formulas from first principles is given in (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13a, example 3.2.3 and remark 3.3.16).

Geometric quantization
Given a prequantum bundle as above, the actual step of genuine geometric quantization consists first of forming half its space of sections in a certain sense. Physically this means passing to the space of wavefunctions that depend only on canonical positions but not on canonical momenta. Second, subgroups of the group of (exponentiated) prequantum operators are made to descend to this space of quantum states, these are the quantum operators or quantum observables.
Quantum states
Historically, the traditional way to formalize the formation of the space of quantum states is as a 3-step process


choose a Polarization;


choose a Metaplectic correction;


form the induced space of quantum states as the space of polarized sections of the prequantum line bundle tensored a certain half-form bundle.


This we discuss at

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections

This traditional route via polarizations and metaplectic corrections has the disadvantage that mathematically it is not a very natural operation. However, under mild conditions it turns out to be equivalent to the following mathematically very natural construction


choose a KU-orientation, hence a spin^c structure of XX compatible with the given prequantum bundle;


take the space of quantum states to be the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point, hence the index of the spin^c Dirac operator twisted by the prequantum line bundle.


This general geometric quantization by push-forward is discussed below at

Quantum space of states as index of a Dirac operator.

In the special case that the prequantum line bundle admits a Kähler polarization this push-forward quantization has a direct expression in terms of the complex abelian sheaf cohomology and of the Dolbeault operator of the prequantum holomorphic line bundle. Now the choice of metaplectic correction is precisely a spin structure (a “Theta characteristic”) and the index is now that of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator which is equivalently just the Euler characteristic of the holomorphic abelian sheaf cohomology of the prequantum line bundle. This complex Dolbeault quantization case we discuss in

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology

and

Quantum state space as index of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections
For (X,ω)(X, \omega) a symplectic manifold, choose a Kähler polarization, hence an involutive Lagrangian subbundle 𝒫⊂T 𝒞X\mathcal{P} \subset T_{\mathcal{C}} X such that 𝒫∩𝒫¯=0\mathcal{P} \cap \overline{\mathcal{P}} = 0. Choose moreover a metaplectic correction of 𝒫\mathcal{P}. This defines the half-density bundle Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} along 𝒫\mathcal{P}.
Let now (L,∇)(L,\nabla) be a prequantum line bundle for (X,ω)(X,\omega).

Definition
The space of quantum states of the prequantum bundle defined by the choice of Kähler polarization 𝒫\mathcal{P} and metaplectic correction Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} is the space of sections of the tensor product L⊗Ω𝒫L \otimes \sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} which are covariant derivative covariantly constant with respect to ∇\nabla along 𝒫¯\overline{\mathcal{P}} and square integrable with respect to the induced integration over X/𝒫¯X/\overline{\mathcal{P}}:
ℋ pol:L 2({ψ∈Γ(L⊗Ω𝒫)|∇ 𝒫¯ψ=0}).
  \mathcal{H}_{pol}
  \colon
  L^2
  \left(
  \left\{
   \psi \in \Gamma(L \otimes \sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}})
   \;|\;
   \nabla_{\overline{\mathcal{P}}} \psi = 0
  \right\}
  \right)
  \,.


For instance (Bates-Weinstein, def. 7.17).

Remark
In the case of Kähler polarization it is useful to write Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0} for the canonical line bundle of the polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} for the corresponding choice of metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology
Let (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a compact topological space symplectic manifold, L ωL_\omega a prequantum line bundle, 𝒫\mathcal{P} a Kähler polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} a metaplectic correction.

Definition
The corresponding Euler quantum Hilbert space is the virtual vector space
ℋ Euler≔⨁ k=0 n(−1) kH 0,k(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0),
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \coloneqq
  \bigoplus_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k \, H^{0,k}(X,L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}})
  \,,


which is the alternating direct sum of the Dolbeault cohomology space of XX with coefficients in the tensor product L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the prequantum line bundle with the metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.


Remark
The Kodaira vanishing theorem asserts that if L ωΩ n,0 −1L_\omega \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1} is a positive line bundle then all the higher cohomology groups in the above expression vanish. Therefore in this case the definition coincides with that via polarizations in def.  above.
(L ω⊗Ω n,0 −1positive)⇒(ℋ pol≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(
    L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1}
    \;
    positive
  \right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left(
    \mathcal{H}_{pol} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


Quantum state space as index of Dolbeault-Dirac operator
Suppose again that (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is equipped with a Kähler polarization.
We need the following general fact on spin structures over Kähler manifolds.

Proposition
A choice of spin structure on the Kähler manifold XX (of real dimension 2n2n) is equivalently a choice of square root (“Theta characteristic”) Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the canonical line bundle Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0}.
Given such a choice, there is a natural isomorphism between the spinor bundle S XS_X and the (anti-)holomorphic form bundle tensored by this square root
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0.
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
 \,.


Finally, the corresponding Dirac operator is the Dolbeault-Dirac operator ∂¯+∂¯ *\overline{\partial} + \overline{\partial}^\ast.

See at spin structure – Over a Kähler manifold.

Remark
It follows that the Dirac operator on XX which is twisted by the connection ∇\nabla on the prequantum holomorphic line bundle L ωL_\omega is of the form
∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *:Ω 0,even/odd(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0)→Ω 0,odd/even(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0).
  \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}^\ast_\nabla
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^{0,even/odd}\left(X, \;L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \to 
  \Omega^{0,odd/even}\left(X, \; L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \,.


Observe how from the point of view of just the Dolbeault operator, this is twisting not just by the prequantum line bundle itself but by the metaplectically corrected prequantum line bundle L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}, while from the point of view of the Dirac operator it is just twisting by L ωL_\omega, since tensoring with the square root line bundle Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} induces the isomorphism between the antiholomorphic differential form bundle and the actual spinor bundle over the Kähler manifold.


Definition
The Dolbeault-Dirac space of quantum states of (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is the index of the L ωL_\omega-twisted Dolbeault-Dirac operator (the Todd genus)
ℋ DolbDir≔index(∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *).
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDir} 
    \coloneqq
  index( \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}_\nabla^\ast )
  \,.



Remark
This definition agrees with that by abelian sheaf cohomology in def. 
ℋ Euler≃ℋ DolbDirac.
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac}
  \,.



Remark
What before in the quantization prescription by polarization and by abelian sheaf cohomology was the “metaplectic correction” introduced “by hand” is now naturally part of the isomorphism of prop.  which identifies the Dirac operator with the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state spaces as index of the Spin cSpin^c-Dirac operator
Finally we come to the true definition of geometric quantization, the most general and at the same time most natural one which contains the above as special cases.
The actual definition is def.  below. Here we lead up to it by spelling out the ingredients.
We need the following general facts about spin^c Dirac operators.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the spin^c-Lie group Spin c(n)Spin^c(n) is equivalently


the tensor product of the ordinary spin group Spin(n)Spin(n) with the circle group over the group of order 2
Spin c≃Spin(n)×ℤ 2U(1)
  Spin^c \simeq Spin(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1)



the loop space object
Spin c≃ΩBSpin c
  Spin^c \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B} Spin^c


of the homotopy fiber product of the universal smooth second Stiefel-Whitney class and the mod-2 reduction of the universal first Chern class in smooth infinity-groupoids:
BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ ⇙ ≃ ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod \, 2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.



Here the top horizontal map is called the universal determinant line bundle map.

See at spin^c group for more details.

Remark
It follows that if we represent elements of Spin c(n)≃SO(n)×ℤ 2U(1)Spin^c(n) \simeq SO(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1) as equivalence classes of pairs (g,c)(g,c), then the determinant line bundle map of def.  is given by
det:(g,c)↦2c,
  det \;\colon \; (g,c) \mapsto 2c
  \,,


where on the right we write the group operation in the abelian group U(1)U(1) additively.
This factor of 2 on the right is crucial in all of the following.


Definition
Let XX be an oriented smooth manifold. A smooth spin^c structure on XX is a lift τ^ X\hat \tau_X of the classifying map τ X:X→BSO(n)\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B} SO(n) of its tangent bundle through the left vertical map in def. 
  BSpin c(n)   τ^ X↗ ↓ X →τ X BSO(n).
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}SO(n)
  }
  \,.



Remark
In words this says that a spin^c structure on an oriented manifold XX is a choice of circle group-principal bundle or equivalenty of hermitian complex line bundle such that its first Chern class modulo 2 equals the second Stiefel-Whitney class w 2w_2 of XX. If this second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes (as an element in H 2(X,ℤ 2)H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)) this means that XX has a genuine spin structure. So in other words whenever the determinant line bundle of a spin^c structure (in the sens of def. ) has a first Chern class that is divisible by 2, then there is an actual spin^c structure.
We can formalize this statement as follows: there is a commuting square of the form
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →((2⋅)∘p 2 BU(1) ↓  ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}( Spin(n) \times U(1) ) &\stackrel{((2 \cdot)\circ p_2}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}U(1)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod\, 2}}
     \\
     \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}^2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }


similar to the one in def.  but crucially different in that here we have just the cartesian product of Spin(n)Spin(n) with U(1)U(1) in the top left. In the standard presentation of these objects this diagram commutes on the nose (filled by a canonical homotopy) simply because both ways to go from the top left to the bottom right hit 0∈ℤ 20 \in \mathbb{Z}_2: the left-bottom one because BSpin(n)\mathbf{B}Spin(n) is essentially by definition such that the second SW class trivializes on it, and the top-right one because first multiplying by 2 and then reducing mod 2 is 0.
Since the diagram commutes, the universal property of the above homotopy pullback says that there is a canonically induced map
(p 1,p 2):Spin(n)×U(1)→Spin c(n).
  (p_1, p_2) \;\colon\; Spin(n) \times U(1) \to Spin^c(n)
  \,.


Of course this is just the evident quotient projection which on elements is simply the identity
(g,c)↦(g,c),
  (g,c) \mapsto (g,c)
  \,,


only that on the right we regard the pair (g,c)(g,c) as a placeholder for its equivalence class in the tensor product over ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2.
Moreover, the universal property of the homotopy pullback says that every spin^c structure τ^ c\hat \tau_c whose underlying determinant line bundle is such that its first Chern class is divisible by 2 actually factors through this map, hence that it is just the product of an ordinary SpinSpin-principal bundle with a circle bundle.
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →p 2 BU(1)  (p 1,p 2)↓  ↓ B(2⋅) BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ (pb) ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}(Spin(n) \times U(1)) &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(p_1,p_2)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathbf{B}(2 \cdot)}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c_1\,mod\,2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.


This is the crucial relation by which the K-theoretic quantization will harmonize with the above Euler- and Dolbeault- quantization, discussed below.


Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} an even number, write
Δ n≃ℂ 2 n/2
  \Delta_n \simeq \mathbb{C}^{2^{n/2}}


for the canonical complex spin representation, which decomposes into two chiral irreducible representations
Δ n≃Δ n +⊕Δ n −.
  \Delta_n \simeq \Delta_n^+ \oplus \Delta_n^-
  \,.


Then the canonical spin^c-representation
ρ:Spin c(n)×Δ n→Δ n
  \rho \colon Spin^c(n) \times \Delta_n \to \Delta_n


is the one given in the components of remark  by
((g,c),ψ)↦(g(ψ))⋅c
  ((g,c), \psi) \mapsto (g(\psi)) \cdot c


(first act with the spin-component in the usual way and then multiply by c∈U(1)↪ℂc \in U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}).

As discussed at representation we may think of this as a morphism of smooth groupoids (stacks) of the form
ρ:BSpin c(n)→ℂMod≃ℂVect.
  \rho \colon \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n) \to \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Mod} \simeq \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.



Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X:X→BSpin c(n)\hat \tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n), def. , the associated spinor bundle is the one modulated by
S c:X→τ^ XBSpin c(n)→ρℂVect.
  S^c
  \colon
  X \stackrel{\hat \tau_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n)
  \stackrel{\rho}{\to} \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.


Crucial for the comparison of the K-theoretic quantization to be defined in a moment and the above Euler/Dolbeault quantization is the following:

Remark
By remark  it follows that in the case that the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure is divisible by 2, hence in the case that c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2∈H 2(X,ℤ 2)c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \in H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2), then the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle of def.  is just the tensor product of the ordinary underlying spinor bundle with half the determinant line bundle:
(c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2)⇒(S c≃S⊗det(τ^ X)).
  \left( c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(S^c \simeq S \otimes \sqrt{det(\hat \tau_X)}\right)
  \,.


Let now (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a (pre-)symplectic manifold and let (L ω,∇)(L_{\omega}, \nabla) be a prequantum line bundle.

Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X\hat \tau_X on XX whose underlying determinant line bundle coincides, up to equivalence, with (L ω) ⊗ 2(L_\omega)^{\otimes^2}, then the spin^c quantization of this prequantum data is the index of the corresponding spin^c Dirac operator D cD_{\mathbf{c}}:
ℋ K≔index(D c).
  \mathcal{H}_{K} \coloneqq index(D_{\mathbf{c}})
  \,.



Remark
This is equivalently the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point.
Moreover, on cocycles this push-forward is expressed by the traditional construction of Hilbert spaces of quantum states:
let XX be a manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric, a spinor bundle and a Dirac operator D:Γ(S)→Γ(S)D \colon \Gamma(S) \to \Gamma(S). Then the corresponding K-homology cycle is:

Remark
This definition does not assume any choice of polarization, nor any choice of complex structure etc. On the other hand, every choice of almost complex structure (hence in particular of Kähler polarization) does induce a spin^c structure, as discussed there. See also (Borthwick-Uribe 96).

So then we can compare:

Proposition
If a choice of Kähler polarization exists on the compact prequantum geometry (X,L ω)(X,L_\omega), then the K-theoretic quantization of def.  coincides with the Dolbeault-Dirac quantization of def.  and hence, by remark , with the Euler-characteristic definition, def. , so that all the respectives spaces of quantum states agree:
((X,ω)Kaehler)⇒(ℋ K≃ℋ DolbDirac≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(\left(X,\omega\right) \; Kaehler\right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
  \mathcal{H}_K 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac} 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


This is to some extent discussed for instance in (Hochs 08, lemma 3.32, Paradan 09, prop. 2.2).

Proof
Let Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} be a choice of square root (Theta characteristic) of the canonical line bundle, which according to  is a choice of spin structure in the Kähler manifold. Then by that same proposition the corresponding spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}


and so the corresponding L ωL_\omega-twisted spinor bundle is
S⊗L ω ≃(Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0)⊗L ω  ≃Ω 0,•⊗(Ω n,0⊗L ω),
  \begin{aligned}
   S \otimes L_\omega & \simeq
   \left(\Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
    \otimes L_\omega
    \\
    & \simeq
   \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \left(\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
    \otimes L_\omega\right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,


where we have re-bracheted just for emphasis of how the metaplectic correction appears as part of the spinor bundle.
At the same time, by remark  we have that under this assumption that an actual spin structure exists, the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S c≃S⊗L ω.
  S^c \simeq S \otimes L_\omega
  \,.


So the two spinor bundles agree. It is now sufficient to observe that under this identification both the Dolbeault-Dirac operator as well as the spin^c Dirac operator have the same symbol to conclude that they have the same index.


Remark
The assumption in the above that we do have a spin structure is only for comparison with the Euler-/ Dolbeault-quantization. It is not necessary for the K-theoretic geometric quantization by spin^c structure.
In the general case the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure may not admit a square root. (Its failure of having a square root will be compensated precisely by the failure of there being a genuine spin structure.) Still, by the above discussion the index of the corresponding spin^c structure is like a quantization of a would-be square root of the determinant line bundle in this case.

Quantum operators / observables
Given a Hamiltonian action on the symplectic manifold by a Lie group GG, we can apply the above K-theoretic quantization by push-foward in GG-equivariant K-theory, to
K G(*)≃K(*//G)≃R(G)
  K_G(\ast) \simeq K(\ast//G) \simeq R(G)


This is the representation ring of GG and hence yields not just a Hilbert space, but a Hilbert space equipped with a GG-action. This is the action by quantum operators, quantizing the GG-actions. Generalized orientation theory give the necessary condition for this quantization to exist: XX needs to be oriented not just in K-theory (spin^c structure) but in GG-equivariant K-theory (equivariant spin^c structure).
So the geometric quantization of observables is essentially what mathematically is known as Dirac induction.

Broadly, by deformation quantization one means notions of quantization of Poisson manifolds (X,{−,−})\big(X, \{-,-\}\big) in terms of families of non-commutative algebras A ℏA_{\hbar} parameterized by specific admissible (formal) values of Planck's constant ℏ\hbar including ℏ=0\hbar = 0, where A 0=C ∞(X)A_0 = C^\infty(X) is the ordinary commutative algebra of functions on the underlying smooth manifold. The idea is that A ℏA_{\hbar} is the algebra of observables of the corresponding quantum system at that value of ℏ\hbar, arising from “deforming” the commutative product of A 0A_0 in a way that increases with ℏ\hbar and is infinitesimally controlled by the given Poisson bracket {−,−}\{-,-\}.
Deformation quantization is often taken by default to refer to the historically first notion of

formal deformation quantization,

where ℏ\hbar is just a formal variable (i.e. an infinitesimal, but not an actual number) and the underlying vector space of all algebras in question is that of formal power series in ℏ\hbar.
One might naively imagine that the formal power series appearing in formal deformation quantization have a finite radius of convergence ϵ∈ℝ +\epsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+ thus yielding actual (non-formal) deformation quantizations for ℏ<ϵ\hbar \lt \epsilon, but in practice this happens rarely (see reference here). Indeed, geometric quantization makes manifest that prequantization conditions typically force admissible values of 


ℏ

\hbar

 to form a discrete subspace of ℝ +\mathbb{R}_+ with only an accumulation point at ℏ=0\hbar = 0 (namely, in geometric quantization the inverse 1/ℏ1/\hbar is typically constrained to come in integral multiples).
Therefore, beyond formal deformation quantization there are notions of

strict deformation quantizations

where ℏ\hbar is allowed to take discrete positive real values with an accumulation point at ℏ=0\hbar = 0, and where to each such value is associated an actual C*-algebra-of observables.
In its focus on algebras of observables the notion of deformation quantization is roughly dual to geometric quantization, which primarily constructs the spaces of quantum states. In special sitations both notions are compatible, but in general there is a large amount of ambiguity in quantization, between but also within the different approaches.
The notion of path integral originates in and is mainly used in the context of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, where it is a certain operation supposed to model the notion of quantization.
The idea is that the quantum propagator – in FQFT the value of the functor U:Cob→VectU : Cob \to Vect on a certain cobordism – is given by an integral kernel U:ψ↦∫K(−,y)ψ(y)dμU : \psi \mapsto \int K(-,y) \psi(y) d\mu where K(x,y)K(x,y) is something like the integral of the exponentiated action functional SS over all field configurations ϕ\phi with prescribed boundary data xx and yy. Formally one writes
K(x,y)=∫exp(iS(ϕ))Dϕ
  K(x,y) = \int \exp(i S(\phi))\; D\phi 


and calls this the path integral. Here the expression DϕD \phi is supposed to allude to a measure integral on the space of all ϕ\phi. The main problem with the path integral idea is that it is typically unclear what this measure should be, or, worse, it is typically clear that no suitable such measure does exist.
The name path integral originates from the special case where the system is the sigma model describing a particle on a target space manifold XX. In this case a field configuration ϕ\phi is a path ϕ:[0,1]→X\phi : [0,1] \to X in XX, hence the integral over all field configurations is an integral over all paths.
The idea of the path integral famously goes back to Richard Feynman, who motivated the idea in quantum mechanics. In that context the notion can typically be made precise and shown to be equivalent to various other quantization prescriptions.
The central impact of the idea of the path integral however is in its application to quantum field theory, where it is often taken in the physics literature as the definition of what the quantum field theory encoded by an action functional should be, disregarding the fact that in these contexts it is typically quite unclear what the path integral actually means, precisely.
Notably the Feynman perturbation series summing over Feynman graphs is motivated as one way to make sense of the path integral in quantum field theory and in practice usually serves as a definition of the perturbative path integral.
Quantum field theory is the general framework for the description of the fundamental processes in physics as understood today. These are carried by configurations of fields under the generalized rules of quantum mechanics, therefore the name. Notably the standard model of particle physics is a quantum field theory and has been the main motivation for the development of the concept in general.
Historically quantum field theory grew out of attempts to combine classical field theory in the context of special relativity with quantum mechanics. While some aspects of it are understood in exceeding detail, the overall picture of what quantum field theory actually is used to be quite mysterious. There are two main approaches for axiomatizing and formalizing the notion:


algebraic quantum field theory: AQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of operator algebras “of observables” to patches of spacetime;


functorial quantum field theory: FQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of spaces of quantum states to patches of codimension 1, and of maps between spaces of states – the time evolution operator – to cobordisms between such patches.


Both these approaches try to capture the notion of a full quantum field theory. On the other hand, much activity in physics is concerned with perturbative quantum field theory. This is a priori to be thought of as an approximation to a full quantum field theory akin to the approximation of a function by its Taylor series, but not the least because it is often the only available technique, the tools of perturbative quantum field theory are to some extent also taken as a definition of quantum field theory.
The gap for instance between the formal study of the AQFT axioms and physics as done in practice by physicists had to a large extent been due to the fact that AQFT had little to say about perturbative quantum field theory. But recently this has been changing. See perturbative quantum field theory for more.
Recent times have seen major progress in understanding these axiomatizations and connecting them to the structures studied in physics (see the references below), but still the number of interesting phenomena in quantum field theory that physicists handle semi-rigorously and that are waiting for a fully formal understanding is large.
Algebraic Quantum Field Theory or Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory or AQFT for short is a formalization of quantum field theory (and specifically full, hence non-perturbative quantum field theory) that axiomatizes the assignment of algebras of observables to patches of parameter space (spacetime, worldvolume) that one expects a quantum field theory to provide.
As such, the approach of AQFT is roughly dual to that of FQFT, where instead spaces of states are assigned to boundaries of cobordisms and propagation maps between state spaces to cobordisms themselves.
One may roughly think of AQFT as being a formalization of what in basic quantum mechanics textbooks is called the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. On the other hand FQFT axiomatizes the Schrödinger picture .
The axioms of traditional AQFT encode the properties of a local net of observables and are called the Haag-Kastler axioms. They are one of the oldest systems of axioms that seriously attempt to put quantum field theory on a solid conceptual footing.
From the nPOV we may think of a local net as a co-flabby copresheaf of algebras on spacetime which satisfies a certain locality axiom with respect to the Lorentzian structure of spacetime:

locality: algebras assigned to spacelike separated regions commute with each other when embedded into any joint superalgebra.

This is traditionally formulated (implicitly) as a structure in ordinary category theory. More recently, with the proof of the cobordism hypothesis and the corresponding (∞,n)-category-formulation of FQFT also higher categorical versions of systems of local algebras of observables are being put forward and studied. Three structures are curently being studied, that are all conceptually very similar and similar to the Haag-Kastler axioms:


factorization algebras


topological chiral homology


blob homology.


Initially, all three of these encoded what in physics are called Euclidean quantum field theories, whereas only the notion of local net incorporated the fact that the underlying spacetime of a quantum field theory is a smooth Lorentzian space. Recent developments in the formalism of factorization algebras have extended their theory to globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds.
In the context of the Haag-Kastler axioms there is a precise theorem, the Osterwalder-Schrader theorem, relating the Euclidean to the Lorentzian formulation: this is the operation known as Wick rotation.

The Wightman axioms are an attempt to axiomatize and thus formalize the notion of a quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime (relativistic quantum field theory) in the sense of AQFT, i.e. in terms of the assignment of field quantum observables to points or subsets of spacetime (operator-valued distributions).
They serve as the basis of what is known as constructive quantum field theory which seeks to provide a mathematically sound framework for quantum theory over the Minkowski space background of special relativity. Arthur Wightman first formulated them in the 1950s but they were not published until 1964 after advances in scattering theory confirmed their applicability.
The Wightman axioms served to establish rigorously several basic structural properties of quantum field theories on Minkowski spacetime, such as the spin-statistics theorem or the Osterwalder–Schrader theorem relating Lorenzian and Euclidean quantum field theories (“Wick rotation”).
They were later further abstracted to the Haag-Kastler axioms that characterize local nets of operator algebras and serve as the basis for algebraic quantum field theory. See there for further details.

Wikipedia on the Wightman axioms

The Wightman Reconstruction Theorem
The vacuum expectation values (n-point functions) of the theory are all (tempered, by the axioms) distributions of the form
⟨0|ϕ i 1(f 1)…ϕ i n(f n)|0⟩ 
\langle0| \phi_{i_1}(f_{1})\ldots\phi_{i_n}(f_{n})|0\rangle 


The term “distribution” is used interchangably with “function” and “value” in the physics literature. The Wightman reconstruction theorem states properties that a set of tempered distributions {𝒲 n|n∈N}\{\mathcal{W}^n | n \in \N \} need to have to be the set of vacuum expectation values of a Wightman theory, and all such Wightman theories are then unitarily equivalent. …to be continued…
Equivalence to Euclidean Field Theory
See Osterwalder–Schrader theorem
Equivalence to the Haag–Kastler Axioms
See Haag–Kastler axioms. Since both the Wightman and the Haag-Kastler approach try to formulate an axiomatic approach to quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, the natural question to ask is what is their relationship? Three possible answers come to mind:


They are equivalent.


One contains the other, i.e. one set of axioms implies the other.


At least one is wrong (from the physical viewpoint).


Unfortunatly the situation does not seem to be as clear as this list suggests. The current state of the affair seems to be that

“the Haag-Kastler approach is more convenient, because it deals with algebras of bounded operators, while Wightman fields are allowed to generate unbounded operators”

and

“a Wightman field theory is equivalent to a Haag-Kastler theory, if some mild additional assumptions are made”.

Tim van Beek: The two statemants above are a condensate of diverse papers I read, any input about the true state of the art would be most welcome. My educated guess is that the “mildness” of the assumptions indicates the fact that all physically realistic models are supposed to satisfy these.

Should it be bounded or unbounded operators/observables?


Pro: Some observables do not have an upper bound, e.g. you can always increase the impulse of an electron, no matter how big that already is (in theory).


Contra: A detector has an upper bound for every observable it can detect, and that is what is actually measured in an experiment. The situation of the pro-bullet won’t arise because we measure observables in bounded regions of spacetime, and the energy contained in a bounded region is always finite (we are excluding artifacts like black holes from our consideration, of course).


Contra to even asking the question: Theories of bounded and unbounded operators/observables are physically equivalent modulo mathematical subtleties, meaning they produce the same numbers that can be compared to experiments.


One simple situation where the construction of a Haag-Kastler net out of Wightman fields is straight forward is this: Suppose that all smeared field operators of the Wightman theory are essentially self adjoint for real test functions and commute strongly (their spectral projections commute) if the test functions have space-like separated support. Then we can define local algebras by ℳ(𝒪):={F(Ψ(f))|f\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) := \{F(\Psi(f)) | f is a real test function with support contained in 𝒪\mathcal{O} and F is a bounded Borel measurable function on R}\R \}.
(Our assumptions allow us to use the Borel functional calculus).
The Haag–Kastler axioms (Haag-Kastler 64) (sometimes also called Araki–Haag–Kastler axioms) try to capture in a mathematically precise way the notion of quantum field theory (QFT), by axiomatizing how its algebras of quantum observables should depend on spacetime regions, namely as local nets of observables.
The main point of these axioms is to say that


to every causally closed subset 𝒪⊂X\mathcal{O} \subset X of spacetime XX there is associated a C*-algebra 𝒜(𝒪)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O});


for every inclusion 𝒪 1↪𝒪 2\mathcal{O}_1 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_2 of such spacetime regions there is a corresponding inclusion 𝒜(𝒪 1)↪𝒜(𝒪 2)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_1) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_2)


such that this respects composition of inclusions (hence such that 𝒜\mathcal{A} is a functor from the poset of causally closed subsets to C*-algebras)


(causal locality) and such that whenever 𝒪 1,𝒪 2⊂𝒪⊂X\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2 \subset \mathcal{O} \subset X are spacelike separated, then the elements of the corresponding algebras of observables (graded-)commute with each other:
[𝒜(𝒪 1),𝒜(𝒪 2)]=t0AAAA∈𝒜(𝒪).
  [\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_1), \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_2)]
  = t
  0
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O})
  \,.



Moreover one wants these assignments to behave well with spacetime symmetry.
The formulation of quantum field theory via these axioms has come to be known as algebraic quantum field theory or AQFT, for short. There are various further axioms in the list such as the time slice axiom. The precise details of the list of axioms is in flux as the theory develops.
The Haag-Kastler axioms in their original form aim for the description of non-perturbative quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime. They could be used to give rigorous proof of structural statements of QFT such as the spin-statistics theorem or the PCT theorem, but examples of interacting field theories in dimensions ≥4\geq 4 are missing.
There are however variants:

In perturbative AQFT one drops the requirement of C*-algebras and instead considers just formal power series algebras (in Planck's constant ℏ\hbar) in order to describe perturbative quantum field theory and connect to the traditional construction of pQFTs via the Feynman perturbation series.

The observation that causal perturbation theory yields quantum observables that satisfy the Haag-Kastler axioms, except that C*-algebras are replaced by formal power series algebras, is due to (Il’in-Slavnov 78, Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, Brunetti-Dütsch-Fredenhagen 09). See at S-Matrix – Causal Locality and Quantum Observables.


In locally covariant perturbative AQFT one generalizes from Minkowski spacetime to more general globally hyperbolic spacetimes in order to describe QFT on curved spacetimes.


In homotopical AQFT one consider homotopical algebras and commutativity only up to coherent homotopy in order to discuss gauge theory with non-trivial topological (instanton) sectors.


Terminology
The approch to quantum field theory based on these axioms is often called AQFT : either for axiomatic quantum field theory (since it was among the first attempts to put the edifice of QFT on solid axiomatic grounds) or algebraic quantum field theory (since it amplifies the algebras of local observables over the spaces of states). Neither of these terms is very descriptive. First there is another, dual, axiomatization which does axiomatize the propagation of states – see FQFT – which, second, is also “algebraic” in some sense, even though algebras of observables to not appear directly.
Another common term for these axioms is local quantum field theory (see the title of the standard textbook (Haag)) since, as becomes clear below, they are focused on encoding the locality properties of QFT in terms of the algebras of observables. However, also the core aspect of extended FQFT is all about the notion of locality of QFT.
Therefore neither of the traditional terms for QFT as axiomatized by Haag-Kastler is truly descriptive in that it genuinely distinguishes from the other, the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization by FQFT. What does distinguish the two approaches may be characterized in traditional terminology of quantum theory as follows (Schreiber, SatiSchreiber):


FQFT axiomatizes the Schrödinger picture of QFT, which encodes the propagation of states through spacetimes;


AQFT axiomatizes the Heisenberg picture of QFT, which encodes the way that observables depend on spacetime.


Motivation
A central difference between the Haag-Kastler axioms and traditionally more widespread formulations of QFT (usually far from being formalized in any way) is the emphasis of the algebra of observables of a QFT (Heisenberg picture) and the de-emphasis of the (Hilbert) spaces of states (Schrödinger picture). This emphasis receives motivation from the the fact that many technical problems of QFT simply disappear when one is not trying to form its spaces of states, while at the same time no real information about the theory is lost.
Examples of technical problems that formulation in terms of spaces of states bring with them are the following:


In quantum field theory as opposed to quantum mechanics, the Stone-von Neumann theorem fails, making the unitary representation of the Heisenberg group on the spaces of states non-unique, hence requiring an explicit choice of representation. There is no generally good theory available for how to make this choice.


More seriously, Haag's theorem says that at a crucial step in perturbation theory where one wants to pass from the representation “free fields” to that of “interacting fields”, the two representations are necessarily inequivalent, contrary to what is (silently or explicitly) assumed in much traditional QFT literature (see EarmanFraser).


In the renormalization or perturbation theory the formulation in terms of states brings with it infrared problems that are simply absent when formulating renormalization just in terms of observables (DuetschFredenhagen).


Structural theorems
It is possible to prove both a spin-statistics theorem and a PCT theorem in the Haag-Kastler approach. The mathematically precise, model independent statements and their proofs are considered to be a major breakthrough of the theory.
Relation to Wightman axioms
Unlike the Wightman axioms, the Haag–Kastler axioms do not need the notion of “field”: the fields in the Wightman axioms are – from the Haag–Kastler point of view – only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.
An operator algebra is any subalgebra of the algebra of continuous linear operators on a topological vector space, with composition as the multiplication. In most cases, the space is a separable Hilbert space, and most attention historically has been paid to algebras of bounded linear operators. The operator algebras themselves are often equipped with their own topologies (e.g. norm topology, weak topology, weak*^* topology and so on) and sometimes involution. C *C^*-algebras are (in the complex case) norm-closed complex **-subalgebras? of the algebra of the bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. They can be however characterized structurally as a **-representation of a Banach algebra with involution satisfying some compatibility conditions; the latter could be called abstract C *C^*-algebras (or sometimes B *B^*-algebras). Every commutative unital C *C^*-algebra can be realized as an algebra of functions on a Hausdorff compact space, which is obtained as its Gel'fand spectrum.
Special class of C *C^*-algebras are von Neumann or W *W^*-algebras (see wikipedia), which are (in the complex case) weakly closed (closed in the weak topology) **-subalgebras of the algebra of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. In structural theory, an important role among von Neumann algebras is played by so-called factors, characterized by the property that their center is trivial (11-dimensional, consisting of “scalars”).
Operator algebras play major roles in functional analysis, representation theory, noncommutative geometry and quantum field theory.
In quantum field theory (or classical field theory) a causally local net of observables is a system (a co-presheaf) of algebras of observables assigned to regions of spacetime, such that this satisfies a few basic properties, such as notably causal locality, saying that observables whose spacetime support is spacelike-separated (graded-)commute with each other (Poisson-commute, in the case of classical field theory).
(Beware that the meaning of “net” here is vaguely similar to, but different from, the concept of net (as in: generalized sequences of points) as used in topology. Better terminology might be “causally local system of spacetime-localized observables”. But “local net” is traditional and has become standard.)
In the context of algebraic quantum field theory the structure of the local net of quantum observables is used as the very axiomatization of what a quantum field theory actually is (“Haag-Kastler axioms”). This may be thought of as a formalization of a spacetime-localized form of the Heisenberg picture of quantum physics (or rather the interaction picture in the case of perturbative AQFT); as opposed to the formalization of the Schrödinger picture in FQFT, where instead the state-propagation is used as the basic axiom.
Traditionally local nets of observables are assumed to take values in C*-algebras, but the basic form of the axioms does not actually refer to topological structure on the algebras, and makes sense more generally.
In particular in perturbative quantum field theory made precise via causal perturbation theory, the algebras of quantum observables are taken to be formal power series algebras (reflecting the infinitesimal nature of perturbation theory) and one derives from causal additivity of the S-matrix that the perturbative quantum observables form a local net of formal power series algebras (see at S-matrix – Causal locality and Quantum observables). Accordingly, this infinitesimal/perturbative version of AQFT is called perturbative AQFT.
Other variants may be considered. For AQFT on curved spacetimes one generalizes from observables associated with regions of Minkowski spacetime to observables associated with more general globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Combining this with perturbation theory is then called locally covariant perturbative AQFT.
Moreover, if gauge theory with nontrivial global gauge field configurations is to be considered (instantons) then one may show that one needs to consider some kind of homotopy theoretic local nets of homotopical algebras. See at homotopical algebraic quantum field theory.
In the literature there is a certain variance and flexibility of what precisely the axioms on a local net of observables are, though the core aspects are always the same: it is a copresheaf of (C-star algebra s) on pieces of spacetime such that algebras assigned to causally disconnected regions commute inside the algebra assigned to any joint neighbourhood.
Historically this was first formulated for Minkowski spacetime only, where it is known as the Haag-Kastler axioms. Later it was pointed out (BrunettiFredenhagen) that the axioms easily and usefully generalize to arbitrary spacetimes.
We give the modern general formulation first, and then comment on its restriction to special situations.

(causal locality) whenever X 1∐X 2↪XX_1 \coprod X_2 \hookrightarrow X is a causal embedding, def. , we have that 𝒜(X 1)⊂𝒜(X)\mathcal{A}(X_1) \subset \mathcal{A}(X) commutes with 𝒜(X 2)⊂𝒜(X)\mathcal{A}(X_2) \subset \mathcal{A}(X).



Remark
The locality axiom encodes the the physical property known as Einstein-causality or micro-causality, which states that physical effects do not propagate faster that the speed of light.


Remark
Many auxiliary operators in quantum field theory do not satisfy causal locality: for instance operators associate to currents in gauge theory. The idea is that those operators that actually do qualify as observables do satisfy the axiom, however, i.e. in particular those that are gauge invariant.

Extra axioms
Einstein locality
Commutativity of spacelike separated observables can be argued to capture only part of causal locality.
A natural stronger requirement is that spacelike separated regions of spacetime are literally independent quantum subsystems of any larger region. By the formalization of independent subsystem in quantum mechanics this means the following:

Definition
A local net 𝒜\mathcal{A} satisfies Einstein locality if for every causal embedding X 1∐X 2→XX_1 \coprod X_2 \to X the subsystems
𝒜(X 1)↪𝒜(X)
  \mathcal{A}(X_1) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(X)


and
𝒜(X 2)↪𝒜(X)
  \mathcal{A}(X_2) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(X)


are independent in that the algebra 𝒜(X 1)∨𝒜(X 2)∈𝒜(X)\mathcal{A}(X_1) \vee \mathcal{A}(X_2) \in \mathcal{A}(X) which they generate is isomorphic to the tensor product 𝒜(X 1)⊗𝒜(X 2)\mathcal{A}(X_1) \otimes \mathcal{A}(X_2).

This appears as (BrunettiFredenhagen, 5.3.1, axiom 4).

Remark
A local net is Einstein local precisely if it is a monoidal functor
𝒜:(LorSp,∐)→(Alg,⊗).
  \mathcal{A} : (LorSp, \coprod) \to (Alg, \otimes)
  \,.


This appears as (BrunettiFredenhagen, 5.3.1, theorem 1).

Remark
Einstein locality implies causal locality, but is stronger.


Remark
Other properties implied by Einstein locality are sometimes extracted as separate axioms. For instance the condition that for X 1∐X 2→XX_1 \coprod X_2 \to X a causal embedding, we have
𝒜(X 1)∩𝒜(X 2)=ℂ.
  \mathcal{A}(X_1) \cap \mathcal{A}(X_2) = \mathbb{C}
  \,.


Strong locality
In (Nuiten 11) the following variant of causal locality was considered and shown to be equivalent to a descent condition for the system of Bohr toposes associated with a local net of observables

Definition
(strong causal locality?)
A net of observables is strongly (causally) local? if it is microlocal (i.e. causally local) in that algebras A 1=A(O 1)A_1 = A(O_1) and A 2=A(O 2)A_2 = A(O_2) associated with spacelike separated regions commute with each other, and in addition for all commutative subalgebras C 1⊂A 1C_1 \subset A_1 and C 2⊂A 2C_2 \subset A_2 the algebra C 1∨C 2⊂A(O 1∨O 2)C_1 \vee C_2 \subset A(O_1 \vee O_2) satisfies


(C 1∨C 2)∩A 1=C 1(C_1 \vee C_2) \cap A_1 = C_1


(C 1∨C 2)∩A 2=C 2(C_1 \vee C_2) \cap A_2 = C_2.



This is (Nuiten 11, def. 14).

Remark
It is clear that Einstein locality implies strong locality, def. 
Einsteinlocality⇒Stronglocality.
   Einstein\;locality \;\;\Rightarrow  \;\; Strong\;locality
  \,.


In fact strong locality is strictly weaker than Einstein locality in that there are strongly locally embedded subalgebras which are not Einstein locally embedded. More discussion of this is in (Wolters 13, section 6.3.3).

Time-slice axiom

Definition
A local net is said to satisfy the time slice axiom if whenever
i:X 1→X 2
  i : X_1 \to X_2


is a causal embedding of globally hyperbolic spacetimes such that X 1X_1 contains a Cauchy surface of X 2X_2, then
𝒜(i):𝒜(X 1)→≃𝒜(X 2)
  \mathcal{A}(i) : \mathcal{A}(X_1) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   \mathcal{A}(X_2)


is an isomorphism.

Relation to spectral triples
Superconformal nets encoding 2d SCFTs may be related to local nets of spectral triples (CHKL 09) (an incarnation of “2-spectral triples”, see there for more).
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is a theorem about local nets in the Haag-Kastler approach to quantum field theory. It states that for certain nets the set of vectors ℳ(𝒪)Ω\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) \Omega (local algebra of a bounded open set applied to the vacuum vector, see Haag-Kastler vacuum representation for definitions and details) is dense in the given state space, a Hilbert space ℋ\mathcal{H}.
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem can be proven to be valid in the Haag-Kastler vacuum representation, but the statement itself is sometimes used as an axiom and called the Reeh-Schlieder property in this case.
The Reeh-Schlieder theorem is of central importance for the mathematical structure theory of the Haag-Kastler approach. The physical interpretation is counterintuitive and therefore to a certain degree controversial: Intuitively one might expect that for a localized observable A∈ℳ(𝒪)A \in \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) the vector AΩA \Omega should be localized in 𝒪\mathcal{O}, that is the state should look like the vacuum in the causal complement of 𝒪\mathcal{O}. But the Reeh-Schlieder theorem says that every, arbitrary state can be approximated by states of the kind AΩA \Omega. This shows that the concept of localized states is nontrivial in AQFT and needs to be handled with care.
Complementary statements about the asymptotic “vacuum-like appearance” of localized observables exist, too, and are commonly called cluster theorem?s.
In other parts of the physics literature, notably in the context of CFT, the Reeh-Schlieder property is also called the state-operator correspondence. See also the remark in (Schroer, footnote 14, page 34).
All necessary definitions can be found at Haag-Kastler vacuum representation.
The Osterwalder-Schrader theorem (Osterwalder-Schrader 73) states precise conditions under which Wick rotation between relativistic field theory and Euclidean field theory works.
Rough idea: The Wightman axioms describe how the algebra of observables of a quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime is generated by quantum fields. The Wightman reconstruction theorem asserts that knowing all correlation functions of all fields in the vacuum state is equivalent to knowing the quantum fields. The Osterwalder–Schrader theorem states conditions that correlation functions on Euclidean spacetime have to satisfy to be equivalent to the correlation functions of a Wightman QFT on Minkowski spacetime.
In this sense the Osterwalder–Schrader theorem states and proves conditions that assure that the Wick rotation is a well defined isomorphism of quantum field theories on Minkowski and on Euclidean spacetime.
This page is about PCT theorems in quantum field theory. PCT stands for parity, charge and time-reversal symmetry (warning: the order of the letters P, C and T varies, some authors use CPT, for example). The laws of nature as described by quantum field theorys are believed to be invariant if one simultaneously reverses the arrow of time, conjugates all charges and reverses all chiral properties. PCT theorems try to make this belief precise by defining the appropriate operators and showing that certain expressions remain constant. Both the statements and the proofs depend on the framework for quantum field theory one uses.
Being “invariant” means that every process that can be observerd in our universe can be observed identically in the “mirror” universe, that is there is no experiment in our universe that cannot be duplicated in the mirror universe.
For some time physicists believed that subsets of the PCT symmetry are respected by nature, but today there are counterexamples known for every subset, for example:


The weak force? violates parity symmetry.


Charge symmetry would violate the observation that the universe consists mostly of matter and not of matter and antimatter.


For CP symmetry violation see Wikipedia: CP violation


All known physical laws are time symmetric, but since PCT symmetry is believed to hold and CP symmetry does not hold, there has to be a process that breaks T symmetry. As of today there is no consenus about what that process may be (there are good reasons to believe that it has nothing to do with the second law of thermodynamics).


Definition in the Wightman approach
The PCT theorem for Wightman fields (see Wightman axioms) was proved by Res Jost, see references.
This proof clarified the different conditions one has to impose, these are:


Covariance of the theory under the (connected part of the) Poincare group.


Positivity of the energy.


There are only fields, which transform with respect to finite dimensional representations of the Lorentz group. (Transformation of the index space.)


Locality, which means that for spacelike distances the Bose fields commute with all other fields and the Fermi fields anticommute with each other.


The Minkowski space has even dimensions.


To every field in the theory appears its conjugate complex partner.


Definition in the Haag-Kastler approach
Let ℳ(𝒥)\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{J}) be a Haag-Kastler net on Minkowski spacetime.

Definition
A PCT operator Θ\Theta on the local net is an anti-linear automorphism, that is for every local algebra ℳ(𝒪)\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}), elements A,B∈ℳ(𝒪)A, B \in \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) and λ∈ℂ\lambda \in \mathbb{C} we have the relations


Θ(AB)=Θ(A)Θ(B)\Theta(A B) = \Theta(A) \Theta(B);


Θ(λA)=λ¯Θ(A)\Theta(\lambda A) = \overline \lambda \Theta(A);


Θ(ℳ(𝒪))=ℳ(−𝒪)\Theta(\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O})) = \mathcal{M}(-\mathcal{O});


such that for (Λ,a)↦U(Λ,a)(\Lambda,a) \mapsto U(\Lambda, a) the given representation of the Poincare group on ℳ\mathcal{M} we have


ΘU(Λ,a)A=U(Λ,−a)ΘA\Theta U(\Lambda, a) A = U(\Lambda, -a) \Theta A;


Θ\Theta transforms every charge sector into its conjugate sector.



A PCT theorem in this context is a theorem that states sufficient conditions such that a PCT operator Θ\Theta exists.

In the Haag-Kastler approach to quantum field theory the central object is a local net of operator algebras. The modular theory says that the local algebras have an associated modular group and a modular conjugation (see modular theory). The result of Bisognano-Wichmann that this page is about, describes the relation of these to the Poincare group.
…
This page is about the modular theory introduced by Tomita for von Neumann-algebras. It is important both for the structure theory of von Neumann-algebras and in the Haag-Kastler approach to AQFT, one important example is the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. It is often called Tomita-Takesaki theory, because the first presentation beyond a preprint is due to Masamichi Takesaki.
In quantum field theory on Minkowski space all fields must transform according to a definite (finite dimensional) representation of the universal cover of the Poincare group, which determines the spin of each field. From the representation theory of the Poincare group it is known that the spin ss is a number s=n2s = \frac{n}{2} with n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}.
On the other hand, if we take fields to be pointwise localized in the sense of the Wightman axioms, then the locality axiom (also known as Einstein microcausality ) says that spacelike separated field operators either commute or anticommute: Two Fermionic fields anticommute, two Bosonic fields commute, a Fermionic and a Bosonic field commute.
The spin-statistics theorem states that fields with integer spin ss (n is even) are Bosonic fields, fields with half-integer spin (n is uneven) are Fermionic fields. A better name for the theorem would therefore be spin- commutation theorem, the name spin- statistics theorem stems from the fact that Bosons (the particles associated to Bosonic fields) are social, multiple particles can exist in the same quantum state, while Fermions are not social: The Pauli exclusion principle says maximally one Fermion can exist in a given quantum state. This leads to different partition functions in statistical mechanics of systems consisting of Bosons only and of Fermions only, hence the name.
The statement and proof of the theorem depend on the framework for quantum field theory that is used, therefore there are, strictly speaking, several versions of the spin-statistics theorem, but the physical interpretation is always the same.
A boson is a particle/quantum field that obeys Bose-Einstein statistics?. By the spin-statistics theorem, this is the same thing as a particle whose spin is an integer. Compare fermion.
A fermion is a particle/quantum field that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics? (Pauli exclusion principle). By the spin-statistics theorem, this is the same thing as a particle whose spin is half an integer but not itself an integer.
In the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology fermions are the matter constituents of the observable universe, as opposed to bosons, which are the quanta of force gauge fields.
The formalization of fermions is in supergeometry: fermion fields are sections of spinor bundles with odd-degree fibers in supergeometry. This is exhibited by what is called Fermi-Dirac statistics? and the Pauli exclusion principle.
An (oriented) cobordism Σ\Sigma from an (oriented) smooth manifold X inX_{in} to an (oriented) smooth manifold X outX_{out} is a smooth manifold with boundary such that its boundary is the disjoint union
∂Σ≃X in∐X out
  \partial \Sigma \simeq X_{in} \coprod X_{out}


with induced orientation agreeing with the given one on X inX_{in} and being the opposite of that of X outX_{out} (Thom 54, Chapter IV, p. 64). Hence by labelling disjoint components of the boundary of any manifold with boundary Σ\Sigma as either “incoming” or “outgoing”, then Σ\Sigma becomes a cobordism from its incoming to its outgoing boundary components.
(While X in∐X outX_{in} \coprod X_{out} is the boundary of Σ\Sigma, conversely Σ\Sigma is the “co-boundary” of X in∐X outX_{in}\coprod X_{out}. This is part of the reason for the “co-” in “cobordism”, but sometimes one just says bordism. The difference is more pronounced when distinguishing between bordism homology theory and cobordism cohomology theory.)
With a few technical conditions on the boundary inclusions added, then (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional manifolds with diffeomorphism classes of nn-dimensional cobordisms between them form a category (a category of cobordisms) whose objects are the manifolds, whose morphisms are the cobordisms, and whose composition operation is the operation of gluing two cobordisms along a common boundary component. Such a category of cobordisms Bord nBord_n of some dimension nn is naturally a symmetric monoidal category Bord n ⊔Bord_n^{\sqcup} with the tensor product being the disjoint union ⊔\sqcup of manifolds.
The connected components in this category are called cobordism classes of manifolds. Under cartesian product and disjoint union, these form what is called the cobordism ring in the given dimension. The study of these classes, hence of manifolds “up to cobordisms”, is a central topic in algebraic topology.
A central insight connecting algebraic topology with mathematical physics is that a strong monoidal functor on a category of cobordisms with values in something like the category Vect (with its standard tensor product of modules) may be thought of as a formalized incarnation of what in physics is called a topological quantum field theory
Z:Bord n ⊔⟶Vect ⊗.
  Z \colon Bord_n^\sqcup \longrightarrow Vect^\otimes
  \,.


Here one thinks of a cobordism Σ\Sigma as a piece of spacetime (or worldvolume) of dimension nn, and of the (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional manifolds that this goes between as a piece of space (or brane). A functor ZZ as above is then thought of as sending each (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional space XX to its space of quantum states Z(X)Z(X) and each spacetime Σ\Sigma between X inX_{in} and X outX_{out} to a linear map Z(Σ):Z(X in)⟶Z(X out)Z(\Sigma)\colon Z(X_{in}) \longrightarrow Z(X_{out}).
From the perspective of mathematics, such a functor is a way to break up diffeomorphism invariants of closed manifolds of dimension nn into pieces and being able to reconstruct them from gluing of data associated to manifolds with (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional boundary.
If one considers manifolds with corners, then there is a fairly evident extension of the concept of cobordism that allows refinement of this gluing process to extended cobordisms of any dimension kk going between extended cobordisms of dimension k−1k-1. Such extended cobordisms of maximal dimension nn form a symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-category called, naturally, the (infinity,n)-category of cobordisms. The cobordism hypothesis asserts that this is a most fundamental object in higher category theory and higher algebra, namely that it is the free symmetric monoidal (infinity,n)-category with duals. The corresponding extended concept of topological quantum field theory is accordingly called extended TQFT or similar.
Relation to Cohomotopy
The Pontrjagin-Thom isomorphism says that assigning Cohomotopy charge identifies suitable cobordism classes of submanifolds or abstract manifolds with cocycles in unstable Cohomotopy (see here) or stable Cohomotopy.
The following graphics illustrates the Cohomotopy charge map of the pair creation/annihilation cobordism for 0-dimensional submanifolds:

nn-Dimensional manifolds (possibly and usually equipped with certain structure, notably for instance with orientation, framing-structure or more general G-structure) should naturally form an (∞,n)-category of extended cobordisms whose


objects are 0-dimensional (oriented) manifolds (disjoint unions of (oriented) points);


1-morphisms are (oriented) cobordisms between disjoint unions of (oriented) points;


2-morphisms are cobordisms between 1-dimensional cobordisms


etc.


(n+1)-morphisms are diffeomorphisms between nn-dimensional cobordisms;


(n+2)-morphisms are smooth homotopies of these;


etc.


The (∞,n)(\infinity,n)-category of cobordisms is the subject of the cobordism hypothesis.
As an nn-fold complete Segal space
Here is an outline of the idea of the definition of Bord (∞,n)Bord_{(\infty,n)} as given in (Lurie) where the main point, apart from the (∞,n)-category machinery in the background, is definition 2.2.9.
The idea is to start with thinking of nn-dimensional cobordisms as forming something like an n-fold category by simply saying that the collection of composites of cobordisms is given by big cobordisms with markings on them, indicating where we think of them as being composed.
Let’s first do this for composition in one direction, as in an ordinary 1-category of nn-dimensional cobordisms.
Consider a manifold X↪V×ℝX \hookrightarrow V \times \mathbb{R} embedded in a vector space of the form V×ℝV \times \mathbb{R}. We can think of this as a manifold canonically equipped with a coordinate function ϕ:X↪V×ℝ→ℝ\phi : X \hookrightarrow V \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} that measures the “height” or maybe better the “length” of the embedded manifold.
We can pick a bunch of numbers {t j∈ℝ}\{t_j \in \mathbb{R}\} and think of these as marking a bunch of slices of XX, the preimages ϕ −1(t j)\phi^{-1}(t_j). We can think of these slices as being the (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional boundary manifolds at which a sequence of manifolds have been glued together to produce XX.

(there is an obvious picture to be drawn and uploaded here, maybe somebody finds the time and energy)

In this way an embedded manifold X↪V×ℝX \hookrightarrow V \times \mathbb{R}  and a set of kk-numbers {t i}\{t_i\} may represent an element in the space of sequences of composable cobordisms. To make this work as expected, the markings on XX may not be too irregular, so we should impose some conditions on what qualifies as a marked manifold. The precise statement is given further below.
The collection of these tuples, consisting of an embedded manifold X↪V×ℝX \hookrightarrow V \times \mathbb{R} and a collection of kk numbers {t i∈ℝ}\{t_i \in \mathbb{R}\} naturally form a simplicial set, which is like the nerve of the 1-category of nn-dimensional cobordisms under composition in one direction.
To generalize this from just a 1-categorical structure to an nn-categorical structure, we simply take a manifold XX as before, but now draw markings on it in nn transversal directions, thereby putting a kind of grid on it that subdivides the manifold into cubical slices. A manifold with such subdivision on it may then be regarded as giving an element in the space of nn-dimensional pasting diagrams in an nn-fold category.
To formalize this more general case, we embed XX not just into a V×ℝV \times \mathbb{R}, but a V×ℝ nV \times \mathbb{R}^n. This then provides us with nn different coordinate functions ϕ i:X↪V×ℝ n→p iℝ\phi_i : X \hookrightarrow V \times \mathbb{R}^n \stackrel{p_i}{\to} \mathbb{R} on XX, each running along one of the directions in which we may think of XX as having been glued from smaller manifolds.
A collection of markings indicating such gluing is now a collection of numbers {t j 1},{t j 2},⋯{t j n}\{t_j^1\}, \;\{t_j^2\}, \; \cdots \{t_j^n\}, one for each of these directions.
For each direction this yields a simplicial set of such structures, to be thought of as the nerve of the category of cobordisms under composition in one of these directions. Taken together this is an nn-fold simplicial set
Δ op×Δ op×⋯×Δ op→Set
  \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \times \cdots \times \Delta^{op}
  \to Set


which is like the nerve of an nn-fold category of cobordisms.
When suitable regularity conditions are imposed on this data, there is naturally a topology on each of these sets of embedded marked cobordisms, that makes this into an nn-fold simplicial topological space
Δ op×Δ op×⋯×Δ op→Top.
  \Delta^{op} \times \Delta^{op} \times \cdots \times \Delta^{op}
  \to Top
  \,.


To get rid of the dependence of this construction on VV, we can let VV “grow arbitrarily large” by taking the colimit of the above nn-fold cosimplicial spaces as VV ranges over the finite dimensional subspaces of ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty.
The resulting nn-fold simplicial topological space obtained by this colimit then is essentially the (∞,n)-category Bord nBord_n that we are after. It turns out that it actually is an nn-fold Segal space. We just formally complete it to an n-fold complete Segal space
Bord n:(Δ op) n→Top.
  Bord_n : (\Delta^{op})^n \to Top
  \,.


This, then, is a model for the (∞,n)-category of extended nn-dimensional cobordisms.
As a blob nn-category
There is a definition of a blob n-category of nn-cobordisms. See there for more details.
Plain cobordism hypothesis
What is known as the Cobordism Hypothesis is, in its most basic form, the conjecture that, roughly, the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms Bord n frBord_n^{fr} with framing is equivalently the free symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category with duals on a single object.
The idea is due to Baez & Dolan (1995), who stated it in the further generality of 


k

-categories (i.e. for k≤∞k \leq \infty) under the name Tangle Hypothesis (p. 23), before definitions of these higher category theoretical notions were available. The term “cobordism hypothesis” is used by Baez and Dolan only in passing and without definition (p. 25) but was popularized by Lurie (2009) who gave a detailed though still incomplete sketch of a proof by appeal to the notion of 


n

n

-fold complete Segal spaces as a geometric definition of higher categories, thereby breaking the impasse caused by previous attempts (e.g. tac:18-10) which instead tried algebraic definitions of higher categories.
Since a (framed) fully extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT) may be identified with a symmetric monoidal 


(

,

)

(\infty,n)

-functor Z:Bord n fr→𝒞 ⊗Z \colon Bord^{fr}_n \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes, the cobordism hypothesis implies (and should be implied by, via a higher Yoneda lemma) that fully extended TQFTs are entirely determined by their value on the point (the “n-vector space of states” of the theory), and conversely that fully dualizable objects in 𝒞 ⊗\mathcal{C}^{\otimes} equivalently encode such fully extended TQFTs. As such the hypothesis is actually called the “Extended TQFT Hypothesis” by Baez & Dolan (1995) (p. 28).
From the cobordism hypothesis for framing structure it follows fairly readily that the 


∞

\infty

-groupoid of fully dualizable objects in a symmetric monoidal (∞,n)(\infty,n)-category carries an action of the orthogonal group O(n)O(n) and that cobordisms with tangential G-structure for G↪O(n)G \hookrightarrow O(n) are similarly classified by the homopy fixed loci of the corresponding GG-action [Lurie (2009, Thm. 2.4.26)]. This yields the statement of the hypothesis for common notions of cobordisms, such as with orientation (SO(n)-structure), spin structure (Spin(n)-structure), etc.
The idea of the cobordism hypothesis is that:


cylinders count as trivial (identity) cobordisms between their boundary components, corresponding to how local spacetime-evolution in a topological quantum field theory is trivial (corresponding to the physics jargon that “their Hamiltonian vanishes”),


so that all the non-trivial information in cobordism and in TQFT-propagation is in the structure of handle body-attachments (in physics known as: “topology change”) which obey the zig-zag rules known from adjunctions, 2-adjunctions and their further higher dimensional analogs,


which means that the point – regarded as a 0-dimensional element of an nn-dimensional cobordism – is equipped with the structure of, first of all, a dualizable object under the relevant tensor product of cobordisms (which is disjoint union), and next that of a kk-dualizable object for all k≤nk \leq n.


Geometric cobordism hypothesis
More generally, the geometric cobordism hypothesis [Grady & Pavlov (2021)] asserts that general non-topological geometric extended functorial field theories (such as conformal field theory as well as the usual relativistic QFT on curved spacetimes) are similarly enocded by (1.) local data depending only on the notion of geometry and (2.) global topological data encoded only in higher dualizability structure.
For example, the FRS-theorem on rational 2d CFT is, at least in spirit, a realization of this idea: It states that rational 2d conformal field theories, when defined on all possible worldsheet surfaces, are fully encoded (1.) by local geometric data encoded in vertex operator algebras or conformal nets or similar and (2.) global purely topological data (a suitable Frobenius algebra object internal to the modular tensor category of representations of that vertex operator algebra/conformal net).
Conversely, the plain (topological) cobordism hypothesis is the special case of the geometric cobordism hypothesis of no geometric structure and in this sense very much captures the idea which in physics is known as “TQFTs are those QFTS without local degrees of freedom”.
In general, where the notion of extended (geometric) functorial field theory is one candidate for a definition of (non-topological) non-perturbative quantum field theory, the (geometric) cobordism hypothesis may be regarded as the first step in establishing the construction of such theories, reducing the problem entirely to the local behaviour of the theory.
Notice that the local behaviour of quantum field theory is still immensely rich: It keeps busy quantum field theorists most of whom never encounter a topological effect in their life. For example the original statement of the Wightman axioms/Haag-Kastler axioms are entirely concerned only with the local behaviour of Lorentzian QFTs (namely on Minkowski spacetime) and yet the construction of any non-trivial examples in dimensions d≥4d \geq 4 remains wide open.
In this vein, much in the spirit of Freyd’s dictum on the role of categorical algebra in general, one may read the (geometric) cobordism hypothesis as trivializing the trivial part of non-perturbative quantum field theory.
A proof of the geometric cobordism hypothesis is thus the important first step towards the currently wide-open and yet crucial problem of mathematically constructing non-perturbative quantum field theories.
Extended quantum field theory (or multi-tiered quantum field theory) is the fully local formulation of functorial quantum field theory, formulated in higher category theory
Whereas a

1-categoricalTQFT may be regarded as a rule that allows one to compute topological invariants Z(Σ)Z(\Sigma) assigned to dd-dimensional manifolds by cutting these manifolds into a sequence {Σ i}\{\Sigma_i\} of dd-dimensional composable cobordisms with (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional boundaries ∂Σ i\partial \Sigma_i, e.g. Σ=Σ 2∐ ∂Σ 1=∂Σ 2Σ 1\Sigma = \Sigma_2 \coprod_{\partial \Sigma_1 = \partial \Sigma_2} \Sigma_1, then assigning quantities Z(Σ i)Z(\Sigma_i) to each of these and then composing these quantities in some way, e.g. as Z(Σ)=Z(Σ 2)∘Z(Σ 1)Z(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma_2)\circ Z(\Sigma_1);

we have that

in extended TQFT Z(Σ)Z(\Sigma) may be computed by decomposing Σ\Sigma into dd-dimensional pieces with piecewise smooth boundaries, whose boundary strata are of arbitrary codimension kk.

For that reason extended QFT is also sometimes called local or localized QFT. In fact, the notion of locality in quantum field theory is precisely this notion of locality. And, as also discussed at FQFT, this higher dimensional version of locality is naturally encoded in terms of n-functoriality of ZZ regarded as a functor on a higher category of cobordisms.
The category of extended cobordisms
The definition of a jj-cobordism is recursive. A (j+1)(j+1)-cobordism between jj-cobordisms is a compact oriented (j+1)(j+1)-dimensional smooth manifold with corners whose the boundary is the disjoint union of the target jj-cobordism and the orientation reversal of the source jj-cobordism. (The base case of the recursion is the empty set, thought of as a (−1)(-1)-dimensional manifold.)
nCob dn Cob_d is an nn-category with smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds as objects and cobordisms of cobordisms up to nn-cobordisms, up to diffeomorphism, as morphisms.
There are various suggestions with more or less detail for a precise definition of a higher category nCob nn Cob_n of fully extended nn-dimensional cobordisms.
A very general (and very natural) one consists in taking a further step in categorification: one takes nn-cobordisms as nn-morphisms and smooth homotopy classes of diffeomorphisms beween them as (n+1)(n+1)-morphisms. Next one iterates this; see details at (∞,n)-category of cobordisms.

An nn-extended CC-valued TQFT of dimension dd is a symmetric nn-tensor functor Z:nCob d→CZ: n Cob_d \rightarrow C that maps


smooth compact oriented dd-manifolds to elements of RR


smooth compact oriented (d−1)(d-1)-manifolds to RR-modules


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−1)(d-1)-manifolds to RR-linear maps between RR-modules


smooth compact oriented (d−2)(d-2)-manifolds to RR-linear additive categories


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−2)(d-2)-manifolds to functors between RR-linear categories


etc …


smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds to RR-linear (n−1)(n-1)-categories


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds to (n−1)(n-1)-functors between RR-linear (n−1)(n-1)-categories


with compatibility conditions and gluing formulas that must be satisfied… For instance, since the functor ZZ is required to be monoidal, it sends monoidal units to monoidal units. Therefore, the dd-dimensional vacuum is mapped to the unit element of RR, the (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional vacuum to the RR-module RR, the (d−2)(d-2)-dimensional vacuum to the category of RR-modules, etc.
Here nn can range between 00 and dd. This generalizes to an arbitrary symmetric monoidal category CC as codomain category.
Construction of ETQFT’s


By generators and relations


By path integrals (this is Daniel Freed’s approach)


By modular tensor n-categories?


Classification of ETQFT’s
Assume Z:nCob d→nVect(R)Z: n Cob_d \rightarrow n Vect(R) is an extended TQFT. Since ZZ maps the (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional vacuum to RR as an RR-vector space, by functoriality ZZ is forced to map a dd-dimensional closed manifold to an element of RR. Iterating this argument, one is naturally led to conjecture that, under the correct categorical hypothesis, the behaviour of ZZ is enterely determined by its behaviour on (d−n)(d-n)-dimensional manifolds. See details at cobordism hypothesis.

What is called perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT) is quantum field theory where the interaction (between fields/particles) is treated as a tiny perturbation of the “free field theory” where no interaction is assumed to take place (“perturbation theory”). This is meant to be an approximation to the actual non-perturbative quantum field theory. However, the latter remains elusive except for toy examples of low spacetime dimension, vanishing interaction and/or topological invariance and most of the “quantum field theory” in the literature is tacitly understood to be perturbative.
 Hence pQFT studies the infinitesimal neighbourhood (also called the formal neighbourhood) of free classical field theories in the parameter space of all quantum field theories, the rest of the space being the realm of non-perturbative QFT:
Mathematically this means that the resulting quantum observables in pQFT (typically: scattering amplitudes or “S-matrices” encoded by Feynman diagrams) are formal power series in the coupling constant gg which measures the strength of the interaction (as well as in Planck's constant, which measures the general strength of quantum). This distinguishes perturbative quantum field theory from non-perturbative quantum field theory, where the algebras of quantum observables are supposed to be not formal power series algebras, but C*-algebras.



While just describing a tiny (infinitesimal) part of QFT, perturbative QFT is way better understood than full non-perturbative QFT (which remains ill-understood to the extent that it has been named a Millennium Problem), and has the reputation of still being dramatically successful in practice – though this applies to some field theories (such as QED) much more than to others (such as QCD), see below.
The key object of perturbative QFT is the perturbative scattering matrix which expresses, as a formal power series in the ratio of the coupling constant over Planck's constant, the probability amplitude of scattering processes, namely of processes where free fields in a certain state come in from the far past, interact and hence scatter off each other, and then go off in some other quantum state into the far future. The scattering cross sections thus defined are the quantities which may be directly measured in scattering experiments, such as the LHC accelerator.
The perturbative S-matrix turns out to have an expression as a sum over separate scattering amplitudes for elementary processes labeled by Feynman diagrams, each of which depicts one specific way for fields (particles) to interact with each other. That the full S-matrix is the sum over all amplitudes for all these possible scattering processes, the Feynman perturbation series, is an incarnation of the informal heuristic of the path integral and the superposition principle in quantum physics, which says that the probability amplitude for a specific outcome is the sum over the probability amplitudes of all the possible processes that can contribute to this outcome.
For all interesting interacting field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, this scattering matrix formal power series necessarily has vanishing radius of convergence (Dyson 52). If it is assumed that the formal Feynman perturbation series is the Taylor series of an actual smooth function given by the actual non-perturbative quantum field theory that is being approximated, then this means that it is at least an asymptotic series (by this example) whose first couple of terms could sum to a good approximation of the actual value to be computed. Indeed, the sum of the first few loop orders in the S-matrix for QED and QCD in the standard model of particle physics turns out to be in agreement with experiment to good precision.
(There are however known non-perturbative effects which are not captured in perturbation theory, such as confinement in QCD, supposed related to instantons in QCD. In resurgence theory one tries to identify these from the asymptotic nature of the Feynman perturbation series.)
A key step in the construction of perturbative quantum field theory is the renormalization of the point interactions. This comes about because given


a local Lagrangian density defining the nature of the fields and their interactions,


a vacuum state (generally: Hadamard state) that defines the free quantum field theory to be perturbed about


it turns out that the construction of the perturbative S-matrix (the Feynman perturbation series) still involves at each order a finite-dimensional space of choices to be made. Physically, these are the specification of further high energy interactions not seen in the original local Lagrangian density; mathematically, this is the choice of extending the time-ordered product of the interaction, which is an operator-valued distribution, to the locus of coinciding interaction points, in the sense of extensions of distributions.
Historically, perturbative quantum field theory as originally conceived informally by Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson in the 1940s, had been notorious for the mysterious conceptual nature of its mathematical principles (“divergences”). The mathematically rigorous formulation of renormalization (“removal of UV-divergences”) in perturbative quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime was established by Epstein-Glaser 73, based on Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59 and Stückelberg 51), now known as causal perturbation theory; laid out in the seminal Erice summer school proceeding (Velo-Wightman 76).
The correct definition of the adiabatic limit (“removal of IR divergencies”) was understood in Il’in-Slavnov 78 and eventually developed by Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01, Brunetti-DütschFredenhagen 09, this is now called perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. The rigorous derivation of the previously informal Feynman rules and their dimensional regularization for computation of scattering amplitudes was achieved in Keller 10 (IV.12), Dütsch-Fredenhagen-Keller-Rejzner 14. Quantization of gauge theories (Yang-Mills theory) in causal perturbation theory/perturbative AQFT was then discussed (for trivial principal bundles and restricted to gauge invariant observables) in the spirit of BRST-complex/BV-formalism in (Fredenhagen-Rejzner 11b). The generalization of all these constructions from Minkowski spacetime to perturbative quantum fields on more general spacetimes (i.e. for more general gravitational background fields such as appearing in cosmology or black hole physics) was made possible due to the identification of the proper generalization of vacuum states and their Feynman propagators to Hadamard states on globally hyperbolic spacetimes in Radzikowski 96. The resulting rigorous perturbative QFT on curved spacetimes was developed in a long series of articles by Hollands, Wald, Brunetti, Fredenhagen and others, now called locally covariant perturbative AQFT.
While this establishes a rigorous construction of perturbative quantum field theory on general gravitational backgrounds, the construction principles had remained somewhat ad-hoc: The axioms for the perturbative S-matrix (equivalently for the time-ordered products or retarded products of field operators) were well motivated by comparison with the Dyson series in quantum mechanics, by the heuristics of the path integral and not the least by their excellent confirmation by experiment, but had not been derived from first principles of quantization. Then in Dütsch Fredenhagen 01 it was observed that the Wick algebras of quantum observables in free quantum field theory are equivalently the Moyal deformation quantization of the canonical Poisson bracket (the Peierls bracket or causal propagator) on the covariant phase space of the free field theory (or rather of a choice of Hadamard state for it) and Collini 16 showed that under suitable conditions the perturbative interacting observable algebra is the Fedosov deformation quantization of covariant phase space of the interacting theory. A general argument to this extent was given in Hawkins-Rejzner 16.
This suggests that the construction of the full non-perturbative quantum field theory ought to be given by a strict deformation quantization of the covariant phase space. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in spacetime dimension ≥4\geq 4 is known. In particular the phenomenologically interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of Yang-Mills theory this open problem to go beyond perturbative quantum field theory is one of the “Millennium Problems” (see at quantization of Yang-Mills theory). For the case of quantum gravity this is possibly the 10 410^4-year problem that the field is facing. But observe that as a perturbative (effective“) quantum field theory, quantum gravity does fit into the framework of perturbative QFT, is mathematically well-defined and makes predictions, see the references there.

main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory

In quantum field theory
In quantum field theory a vacuum state is supposed to be a quantum state that expresses the absence of any particle excitations of the fields.
On Minkowski spacetime the vacuum state for a free field theory is the standard Hadamard state. On general globally hyperbolic spacetimes there are always Hadamard states, and they do play the role of the vacuum state in the construction of AQFT on curved spacetimes, see at locally covariant perturbative AQFT. Notably the choice of such a Hadamard state fixes the Feynman propagator, hence the time-ordered product of quantum observables and thus the perturbative S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points (the extension of these distributions to coinciding interaction points is the process of renormalization).
However, since on a general globally hyperbolic spacetime there is no globally well-defined concept of particles, there is in general no concept of vacuum state. But under good conditions (such as existence of suitable timelike Killing vectors) one may identify Hadamard states which deserve to be thought of as vacuum states (Brum-Fredenhagen 13).
In string theory
As mentioned above, in perturbative quantum field theory a choice of vacuum state (more generally: Hadamard state) defines the Feynman propagator, hence the time-ordered product of quantum observables and thus the perturbative S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points and extended to coincing interaction points via a choice of renormalization.
Now perturbative string theory is not a local field theory, in which the S-matrix is derived (up to choice of vacuum state and renormalization) from a local Lagrangian density, but is defined by declaring the string perturbation series (obtained by other means, namely by 2d CFT correlators) to be the scattering matrix.
Hence while a vacuum in perturbative string theory cannot be a quantum state as in local field theory (since there is a priori just no free field Wick algebra that it could be a quantum state on), it makes sense to define a vacuum of perturvative string theory to be whatever data it takes to define the stringy S-matrix, namely the string perturbation series. This datum is that of a 2d SCFT (of central charge 15).
Hence in perturbative string theory the vacua of the effective background QFT are at the same time identified with certain 2-dimensional CFTs – which for “geometric vacua” are the string sigma-models which have the given effective QFT as their second quantization.
Perturbative string theory is defined as the string perturbation series of these sigma-models about these vacua.
The moduli space of these vacua – which is hardly understood – has come to be called the landscape of string theory vacua .
While fundamental physics is at some level well described by quantum field theory, a typical Lagrangian used to define such a QFT can reasonably be expected to define only degrees of freedom and interactions that are relevant up to some given energy scale. In this perspective one speaks of the theory as being the effective quantum field theory of some – possibly known but possibly unspecified – more fundamental theory.
An example (historically the first to be successfully considered) is the Fermi theory of beta decay of hadrons: this contains interactions of four fermions at a time, for instance a process in which a neutron decays into a collection consisting of a proton, an electron and a neutrino. Later it was discovered that, more fundamentally, this is not a single reaction but is composed out of several other interactions that involve exchanges of W-bosons between these four particles. Nevertheless, Fermi’s original effective theory made very precise predictions at energy scales less than 10 MeV. The reason is that the WW-boson has mass several orders of magnitude higher than that (about 80 GeV) and was thus effectively invisible at these low energies.
The low energy expansion of any unitary, relativistic, crossing symmetric S-matrix can be described by an effective quantum field theory.
In the perspective of effective field theory notably non-renormalizable interaction Lagrangians can still make perfect sense as effective theories and give rise to well defined predictions: they can be effective approximations to renormalizable more fundamental theories. This is sometimes called a UV completion of the given effective theory.
For instance quantum gravity – which is notoriously non-renormalizable? – makes perfect sense as an effective field theory (see for instance the introduction in (Donoghue). It is in principle possible that there is some more fundamental theory with plenty of excitations at high energies that is however degreewise finite in perturbation theory, whose effective description at low energy is given by the non-renormalizable Einstein-Hilbert action. (For instance, string theory is meant to be such a theory.)
The construction of a perturbative quantum field theory from a given local Lagrangian density (rigorously via causal perturbation theory) involves ambiguities associated with the detailed nature of the quantum processes at point interactions. What is called renormalization is making a choice of fixing these ambiguities to produce a perturbative quantum field theory (Wightman et al. 76).
In causal perturbation theory the renormalization ambiguities are understood as the freedom of extending the time-ordered product of operator-valued distributions to the interaction points, in the sense of extension of distributions. The notorious “infinities that plague quantum field theory” arise only if this extension is not handled correctly and has to be fixed. Hence what historically is called “renormalization” could from a mathematical point of view just be called “normalization” (a point made vividly for instance in Scharf 95, Scharf 01).
The main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory (theorem  below) states that any two choices of such (re-)normalizations are uniquely related by a re-definition of the interaction Lagrangian density which introduces further point interactions of higher order (“counter terms”),
The extension of distributions of the time-ordered product may naturally be organized via graphs, the Feynman graphs (Garcia-Bondia & Lazzarini 00, Keller 10, chapter IV), and hence the renormalized perturbative S-matrix defining the perturbative quantum field theory is expressed as a formal power series in renormalized Feynman graphs, the Feynman perturbation series (Keller 10 (IV.12)).
Historically the Feynman perturbation series was motivated from intuition about the would-be path integral, and this is still a popular point of view, despite its lack of rigorous formulation. One may understand the axiomatics on the S-matrix in causal perturbation theory as defining the result of the path integral without actually doing an integration over field configurations.
But while path integral quantization for perturbative quantum field theory remains elusive, it has been shown that the (re-)normalized perturbative quantum field theory thus constructed via causal perturbation theory is, at least under favorable circumstances, equivalently the (Fedosov) formal deformation quantization of the covariant phase space induced by the given interacting Lagrangian density (Collini 16). This identifies the (re-)normalization freedom with the usual freedom in choosing formal deformation quantization.
This also suggest that the construction of the full non-perturbative quantum field theory ought to be given by a strict deformation quantization of the covariant phase space. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in spacetime dimension ≥4\geq 4 is known. In particular the phenomenologically interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of Yang-Mills theory this open problem is one of the “Millennium Problems” (see at quantization of Yang-Mills theory).
The following is taken from geometry of physics – A first idea of quantum field theory. See there for more backround.
In physics and specifically in field theory, the BV-BRST formalism is a tool in homological algebra, higher differential geometry and derived geometry to handle the intersection- and quotient-constructions that appear


in the construction of reduced phase spaces of Lagrangian field theories, in particular including gauge theories; (“Lagrangian BV”)


in symplectic reduction of phase spaces (“Hamiltonian BV”)


In either case the BRST-BV complex C ∞(P BV)C^\infty(P^{BV}) is a model in dg-geometry of a joint homotopy intersection and homotopy quotient, hence of an (∞,1)-colimit and (∞,1)-limit, of a space in higher differential geometry/derived geometry.
Accordingly, the BRST-BV complex is built from two main pieces:

it contains in positive degree a BRST-complex: the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the ∞-Lie algebroid which is the homotopy quotient (action Lie algebroid) of the gauge group (in Lagrangian BV) or of the group of flows generated by the constraints (in Hamiltonian BFV) – which is in general an ∞-group in either case – acting on configuration space CC;


it contains in negative degree a Koszul-Tate resolution of the critical locus of the action functional (for Lagrangian BV) or of the constraint surface (in Hamiltonian BFV).

Phenomenology is a part of theoretical physics concerned with a selection of a model (in particle physics) or parameters of a physical model for some physical process on the basis of finding consistency with diverse experimental data, but not necessarily modelling the regimes far from the situation in a considered range of experiments.
Therefore the phenomenology is not concerned with being fundamental, though it may help selecting fundamental models as well; it is interdisciplinary as it selects the models on the basis of various kinds of experimental data simulatenously; it is not concerned with models which are theoretically interesting but can not be measured or there is no concrete physical system known which behaves consistently with the model; phenomenological models are sometimes just the models of averaged or approximated level of description, even when more fundamental description is in principle known but too difficult to study or compare with the experiment.
For example, while so-called standard model of particle physics has inconsistencies if extended to very high energies (failure of the unitarity of S-matrix, problems with the cosmological constant), the model is considered to agree to large extent with a low-energy limit of a true theory. Phenomenological models have to be in accordance with basic principles of physics, like thermodynamical laws, but do not need to pretend to go to the fundamental or microscopic description. For example, the Landau-Ginzburg equations for the description of superconductors do not describe the microscopic origin of supersymmetry, but are rather phenomenological, good enough desciption for certain range of mesoscopic phenomena.
In particle physics
In particle physics phenomenology a model is the specification of a physical theory, fundamentally of a quantum field theory, that reproduces aspects phenomenology, notably the fundamental physics observed in particle accelerators?.
The standard model of particle physics is, by default, the currently best model available, given the available experimental data.
Despite the success of this model, it is conceptually unsatisfactory in many ways and it is clear that it can be a roughly accurate description of reality not high above the currently experimentally available energy-scales. Therefore phenomenologists still “build” plenty of other models that refine the standard model in one way or other, being compatible with the present data, but making various other predictions for what should be observed at higher energies.
It is generally understood that models are approximations to reality. The proverbial saying goes:

Every model is wrong. But some models are useful.

The standard model of particle physics is a model (in particle physics): a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles currently experimentally known, containing

matter: electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other fermions,

as well as three of the four fundamental forces as currently known, which, somewhat roughly, are

force: the electroweak force (including electromagnetism) and the strong nuclear force.

It is defined as a local Lagrangian field theory which is an Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory.
The main ingredient missing from the standard model is the quantum version of the field of gravity. For decades, a large part of theoretical physics has been absorbed with attempts to understand how this last of the known fundamental forces might fit into the picture.
As a quantum field theory, the standard model is in particular a Yang–Mills gauge theory with spinors in Yang–Mills theory.
Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a quantum field theory is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model.
Gauge group
The exact gauge group of the standard model is not quite the product group
U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)


of the circle group with special unitary groups, but is the quotient group

  G_{SM} 
  \;=\;
  \big(
    U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \big)
  / \mathbb{Z}_6


of that by a cyclic group ℤ 6⊂U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)\mathbb{Z}_6 \subset U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) which is the subgroup generated from an element of the form
(q 6,q 21 2,q 31 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3),
  (q_6, q_2 \mathbf{1}_2, q_3 \mathbf{1}_3) \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,,


where q n∈U(1)q_n \in U(1) denotes an nnth primitive root of unity, i.e.
(e 2πi16,e 2πi121 2,e 2πi131 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3).
  \left(
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{6}}
    \;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{2}} \mathbf{1}_2\;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{3}} \mathbf{1}_3
  \right) 
  \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,.


(See Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36 for a fairly comprehensive discussion. See also e.g. HMY 13, p. 2.)
Strikingly, this exact gauge group (1) of the standard model of particle physics happens to coincide with…


…the group
G SM≃S(U(2)×U(3))⊂SU(5)
   G_{SM} 
    \;\simeq\; 
   S\big(U(2) \times U(3)\big) 
    \;\subset\; 
   SU(5)


of determinant-1 elements in the direct product group U(2)×U(3)U(2) \times U(3), which makes manifest that the standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the simple Lie group SU(5).
This is the basis of “grand unified theories” (GUT), speculative extensions of the standard model trying to understand its gauge group as being a spontaneously broken simple Lie group-symmetry.


…the subgroup of the Jordan algebra automorphism group of the octonionic Albert algebra that “stabilizes a 4d sub-Minkowski spacetime” (see there for details).
More concretely, it is identified with the subgroup of Spin(9) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19, see also at SO(10)-GUT)


This is part of ongoing speculation that octonionic exceptional structures might be behind the standard model.

General idea
The standard model of particle physics asserts that the fundamental quantum physical fields and particles are modeled as sections of and connections on a vector bundle that is associated to a GG-principal bundle, where the Lie group GG – called the gauge group – is the product of (special) unitary groups G=SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)G = SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) (or rather a quotient of this by the cyclic group Z/6Z/6, see there) and where the representation of GG used to form the associated vector bundle looks fairly ad hoc on first sight.
A grand unified theory (“GUT” for short) in this context is an attempt to realize the standard model as sitting inside a conceptually simpler model, in particular one for which the gauge group is a bigger but simpler group G^\hat{G}, preferably a simple Lie group in the technical sense, which contains GG as a subgroup. Such a grand unified theory would be phenomenologically viable if a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking at some high energy scale – the “GUT scale” – would reduce the model back to the standard model of particle physics without adding spurious extra effects that would not be in agreement with existing observations in experiment.
The terminology “grand unified” here refers to the fact that such a single simple group G^\hat{G} would unify the fundamental forces of electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force in a way that generalizes the way in which the electroweak field already unifies the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism, and electromagnetism already unifies, as the word says, electricity and magnetism.
Since no GUT model has been fully validated yet (but see for instance Fong-Meloni 14), GUTs are models “beyond the standard model”. Often quantum physics “beyond the standard model” is expected to also say something sensible about quantum gravity and hence unify not just the three gauge forces but also the fourth known fundamental force, which is gravity. Models that aim to do all of this would then “unify” the entire content of the standard model of particle physics plus the standard model of cosmology, hence “everything that is known about fundamental physics” to date. Therefore such theories are then sometimes called a theory of everything.
(Here it is important to remember the context, both “grand unified” and “of everything” refers to aspects of presently available models of fundamental physics, and not to deeper philosophical questions of ontology.)

The SU(5)SU(5)-GUT (Georgi-Glashow)
The argument for the hypothesis of “grand unification” is fairly compelling if one asks for simple algebraic structures in the technical sense (simple Lie groups and their irreducible representations):
The exact gauge group of the standard model of particle physics is really a quotient group
G SM=(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6,
  G_{SM}
  \;=\; 
  \big( U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) \big) / \mathbb{Z}_6
  \,,


where the cyclic group ℤ 6\mathbb{Z}_6 acts freely, hence exhibiting a subtle global twist in the gauge structure. This seemingly ad hoc group turns out to be isomorphic to the subgroup
S(U(2)×U(3))⏟≃(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6⊂SU(5)
  \underset{
    \simeq \big( U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) \big) / \mathbb{Z}_6  }{
  \underbrace{
    S \big( U(2) \times U(3)\big)
  }}
  \;\subset\;
  SU(5)


of SU(5) (see Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36). The latter happens to be a simple Lie group, thus exhibiting the exact standard model Lie group as being “simply” a “(2+3)-breaking” of a simple Lie group.
Moreover, the gauge group-representation V SMV_{SM} that captures one generation of fundamental particles of the standard model of particle physics, which looks fairly ad hoc as a representation of G SMG_{SM} (e.g. Baez-Huerta 09, table 1), but as a representation of SU(5)SU(5) it is simply
V SM≃Λℂ 5
  V_{SM} \simeq \Lambda \mathbb{C}^5


(see Baez-Huerta 09, p. 36-41).
This leads to the SU(5)SU(5)-GUT due to Georgi-Glashow 74
D-Series GUTs
The Spin(10)Spin(10)-GUT (known as “SO(10)SO(10)”)
There is a further inclusion SU(5)↪SU(5) \hookrightarrow  Spin(10) into the spin group in 10 (Euclidean) dimensions (still a simple Lie group), and one generation of fundamental particles regarded as an SU(5)SU(5)-representation Λℂ 5\Lambda \mathbb{C}^5 as above extends to a spin representation (see Baez-Huerta 09, theorem 2). This has the aesthetically pleasing effect that under this identification the 1-generation rep V SMV_{SM} is now identified as
V SM≃16⊕16¯
  V_{SM} \;\simeq\; \mathbf{16} \oplus \overline{\mathbf{16}}


namely as the direct sum of the two (complex) irreducible representations of Spin(10), together being the Dirac representation of Spin(10).
The exact gauge group of the standard model of particle physics (see there) is isomorphic to the subgroup of Spin(9) ⊂\subset Spin(10) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19).
Again, this means that under the embedding of the gauge group G SMG_{SM} all the way into the simple Lie group Spin(10), its ingredients become simpler, not just in a naive sense, but in the technical mathematical sense of simple algebraic objects.

E-series GUTs
The most studied choices of GUT-groups GG are SU(5), Spin(10) (in the physics literature often referred to as SO(10)) and E6 (review includes Witten 86, sections 1 and 2).
It so happens that, mathematically, the sequence SU(5), Spin(10), E6 naturally continues (each step by consecutively adding a node to the Dynkin diagrams) with the exceptional Lie groups E7, E8 that naturally appear in heterotic string phenomenology (exposition is in Witten 02a) and conjecturally further via the U-duality Kac-Moody groups E9, E10, E11 that are being argued to underly M-theory. In the context of F-theory model building, also properties of the observes Yukawa couplings may point to exceptional GUT groups (Zoccarato 14, slide 11, Vafa 15, slide 11).

Relation to proton decay
Many GUT models imply that the proton – which in the standard model of particle physics is a stable bound state (of quarks) – is in fact unstable, albeit with an extremely long mean liftetime, and hence may decay (e.g. KM 14). Experimental searches for such proton decay (see there for more) put strong bounds on this effect and hence heavily constrain or rule out many GUT models.
But in recent years it is claimed that there are in fact realistic SU(5)SU(5) GUT models that do not imply any proton decay, quite generically so for MSSM-models (Mütter-Ratz-Vaudrvange 16), but also for non-supersymmetric models ( Fornal-Grinstein 17, Fornal-Grinstein 18, in particular in gauge-Higgs grand unification such as Spin(11)- (“SO(11)”-) and Spin(12)- (“SO(12)”-) models: (Hosotani-Yamatsu 15, Furui-Hosotani-Yamatsu 16, Sec. 2.6 Hosotani 17, Section 6).
Relation to neutrino masses
The high energy scale required by a seesaw mechanism to produce the experimentally observer neutrino masses happens to be about the conventional GUT scale, for review see for instance (Mohapatra 06).

I also noted at the same time that interactions between a pair of lepton doublets and a pair of scalar doublets can generate a neutrino mass, which is suppressed only by a factor M −1M^{-1}, and that therefore with a reasonable estimate of MM could produce observable neutrino oscillations. The subsequent confirmation of neutrino oscillations lends support to the view of the Standard Model as an effective field theory, with M somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 16GeV10^{16} GeV. (Weinberg 09, p. 15)

Detailed matching of parameters of non-supersymmetric Spin(10)Spin(10)-GUT to neutrino masses is discussed in Ohlsson-Pernow 19
Relation to leptoquarks
Generically, GUT-theories predict the existence of leptoquarks (Murayama-Yanagida 92), possibly related to the apparently observed

Occurrence in string phenomenology
Discussion of string phenomenology of intersecting D-brane models KK-compactified with non-geometric fibers such that the would-be string sigma-models with these target spaces are in fact Gepner models (in the sense of Spectral Standard Model and String Compactifications) is in (Dijkstra-Huiszoon-Schellekens 04a, Dijkstra-Huiszoon-Schellekens 04b):




A plot of standard model-like coupling constants in a computer scan of Gepner model-KK-compactification of intersecting D-brane models according to Dijkstra-Huiszoon-Schellekens 04b.
The blue dot indicates the couplings in SU(5)SU(5)-GUT theory. The faint lines are NOT drawn by hand, but reflect increased density of Gepner models as seen by the computer scan.

In particle physics the letters MSSM are an abbreviation for “minimally supersymmetric standard model”: an extension of the standard model of particle physics to a model (in particle phyiscs) with a minimum amount of extra global supersymmetry.
In quantum field theory scattering amplitudes are the probability amplitudes for processes of scattering of fundamental particles (or fundamental strings etc.) off each other. The collection of scattering amplitudes forms the S-matrix. In perturbative quantum field theory its contributions may be labeled by Feynman diagrams, whence it is also called the Feynman perturbation series.
Of particular interest are vacuum amplitudes which are scattering amplitudes “where nothing external scatters” hence for no incoming and no outgoing states. The 1-loop vacuum amplitudes are regularized traces over Feynman propagators. These are the incarnations of zeta functions, L-functions and eta functions in physics.
A method for computing scattering amplitudes in QFT and in string theory.
In perturbative quantum field theory the KLT relations (Kawai-Lewellen-Tye 86) express tree level scattering amplitudes in (super-)gravity equivalently as squares of scattering amplitudes in (super-)Yang-Mills theory.
These relations are manifest in perturbative string theory-UV-completions of Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, where they were originally found and from which the QFT relations have been deduced: in string theory the graviton is an excitation of the closed string and the gluon of the open string. But cylinder-shaped worldvolume may be read in two different ways: either as a closed string propagator or as an open string vacuum diagram. This open/closed string duality of string scattering amplitudes yields the KLT relations.
Moreover, a color-kinematics duality suggest that these relations extend from tree level to all loop order.
Its classical field theory counterpart is named classical double copy.
In physics, universality is a term which means the following:

Under the proper conditions, different systems can exhibit the same behaviour, as measured by quantitative indices, if they meet the same qualitative criteria. Sets of systems which are equivalent in this manner are known as universality classes.

If we have some complicated phenomenon we can’t understand directly, and we figure out (or make a good stab at guessing) the universality class to which it belongs, we can make testable predictions about the complicated thing by working with a simpler member of that universality class. Membership in a universality class depends on properties like how many spatial dimensions a system lives in, symmetries and the like. People have identified universality classes, with varying degrees of rigour. Lots of them have names, sometimes even with dashes inside; the ones we understand less well and aren’t so familiar with get abstruse symbols for labels instead. A non-exhaustive tabulation of these labels might look something like this:

The general concept of renormalization is really important here. The universality classes we understand best correspond to fixed points of renormalization-group transforms.
The first column, “stable distributions”, basically comes from the central limit theorem and the ways in which the conditions necessary for it to apply can fail to obtain. The middle column with all the funny symbols comes from Élie Cartan‘s classification of symmetric spaces. The 2D part of the equilibrium statistical systems can be given a taxonomy based on the ADE classification of Dynkin diagrams and conformal field theories. As Cardy (2010) writes,

[T]he study of the representation theory of the Virasoro algebra gives a way of classifying all possible CFTs and thereby universality classes in 2d. The breakthrough in this direction came following the seminal 1984 paper of Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov (BPZ) in which they showed that, for certain special rational values of c<1c \lt 1, the CFT closes with only a finite number of representations of the Virasoro algebra, and, for, these cases, all the critical exponent?s and multi-point correlation functions are calculable. Shortly thereafter Friedan, Qiu and Shenker showed that unitary CFTs (corresponding to local, positive definite Boltzmann weights) are a subset of this list, with c=1−6/m(m+1)c = 1 - 6/m(m + 1) and mm an integer ≥3\geq 3. This gives rise to what might be termed the ‘conformal periodic table’. The first few examples may be identified with well-known universality classes. The ‘hydrogen atom’ of CFT is the scaling limit of the critical Ising model, ‘helium’ is the tricritical Ising model, and so on. Note, however, that at the next value of c=4/5c = 4/5 two possible ‘isotopes’ arise. In the second, corresponding to the critical 3-state Potts model, not all the scaling dimensions allowed by BPZ in fact occur, but some of those that do actually appear twice. In fact the constraint of unitarity is not sufficient to determine exactly which representations actually occur in a given CFT. The answer to this is provided by demanding consistency of the theory on a torus, by interchanging the interpretations of space and imaginary time []. For the torus, this is a modular transformation, and the requirement of modular invariance has become another powerful tool in classifying CFTs, completely solved in the case c<1c \lt 1 by Cappelli, Itzykson and Zuber.

Some relationships between columns can be identified. For example, dynamical surface growth and random matrix theory are, unexpectedly, linked: the eigenvalue distributions of the Gaussian Unitary? and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles? show up as surface heights in Kardar-Parisi-Zhang phenomena. See (Takeuchi et al.).
There are at least two things that are called quantum anomalies in the context of quantum field theory


anomalous action functional: the action functional (in path integral quantization) is not a globally well defined function, but instead a section of a line bundle on configuration space;


anomalous symmetry (gauge anomaly): a symmetry of the action functional does not extend to a symmetry of the exponentiated action times the path integral measure; or equivalently the action of a group on classical phase space is not preserved by deformation quantization.


Anomalous action functional
There are two major kinds of action functionals that may be anomalous in that they are not actually functions/functionals on the configuration space of fields, but just sections of some line bundle:


theories with fermions (see e.g. spinors in Yang-Mills theory) whose action functional is given by a Dirac operator, or else other fields whose action functional is given by a Fredholm operator.


gauge theories with higher degree gauge fields (differential cocycles of higher degree.)


Fermionic anomalies
The path integral for a quantum field theory with fermions can be decomposed into a fermionic path integral (see there for more details) over the fermionic fields followed by that over the bosonic fields. The former, a Berezin integral, is typically well defined for a fixed configuration of the bosonic fields, but does not produce a well defined function on the space of all bosonic fields: but a twisted function, a section of some line bundle called a determinant line bundle or, in 8k+28k+2 dimensions, its square root, the Pfaffian line bundle.
So to even start making sense of the remaining path integral over the bosonic degree of freedom, this determinant line bundle or the corresponding Pfaffian line bundle has to be trivializable. Its non-trivializability is the fermionic anomaly .
More in detail (Freed 86), the path integral over an Lagrangian of the form (ϕ¯,Dϕ)(\overline \phi, D \phi) for
D:V⟶W
  D \;\colon\; V \longrightarrow W


a Fredholm operator computes the determinant of that operator. Formally this is a section of the determinant line bundle over the remaining fields
(detV) *⊗(detW)≃(detkerD) *⊗(detcokerD),
  (det V)^\ast \otimes (det W)
  \simeq
  (det ker D)^\ast \otimes (det coker D)
  \,,


where the left hand side makes sense and the equivalence holds for VV and WW finite dimensional, and where the right hand side is the definition of the expression for general Fredholm operators. ((Freed 86, 1.))
In more detail this determinant line bundle also carries a connection on a bundle. To make the formal path integral, which is a section of this bundle, into an actual function, one this bundle with connection needs to be trivializable and trivialized. The obstruction to this is the anomaly.
Higher gauge-theoretic anomalies
For the moment see Green-Schwarz mechanism for more.
Anomalous symmetry

under construction

Let
S:C→ℝ
  S : C \to \mathbb{R}


be a (well defined) action functional. Write PP for its resolved covariant phase space in dg-geometry and
S BV:P→ℝ
  S^{BV} : P \to \mathbb{R}


for the BV-action functional, both as given by BRST-BV formalism.
If the action functional is local (comes from a Lagrangian on a jet bundle) the covariant phase space PP a priori only carries a presymplectic structure. But by BV-theory there exists an equivalent (homotopical) derived action functional S Ψ BV:P→ℝS_\Psi^{BV} : P \to \mathbb{R} such that S Ψ BVS_\Psi^{BV} does induce a genuine symplectic structure on the derived space PP.
For ordinary Poisson manifolds and hence symplectic manifolds Maxim Kontsevich‘s theorem says that their deformation quantization always exist. But if SS is the action functional of a gauge theory then PP is in general a nontrivial derived infinity-Lie algebroid (its function algebra has “ghosts” and “ghosts of ghost”: the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra generators) and the theorem does not apply. Instead, the quantization of the derived symplectic space PP exists only if the first and second infinity-Lie algebroid cohomology of PP vanishes:
These two cohomology groups
Anom gauge=H 1(CE(P))⊕H 2(CE(P))
 Anom_{gauge} = H^1(CE(P)) \oplus H^2(CE(P))


are called the gauge anomaly of the system. Only if they vanish does the quantization of the gauge theory encoded by SS exist.
More concretely, the function algebra on PP is a graded-commutative dg-algebra equipped with a graded Poisson bracket {−,−} BV\{-,-\}_{BV} and an element Q∈C ∞(P)Q \in C^\infty(P) (the BV-BRST charge) whose Hamiltonian vector field is the derivation that is the differential of the dg-algebra C ∞(X)C^\infty(X). If the gauge anomaly does not vanish, then, while the deformation quantization of the graded algebra C ∞(P)C^\infty(P) to a non commutative graded algebra with commutator [−,−][-,-] will exist, it may happen that the image SS of QQ under the quantization no longer satisfies the quantum master equation [S,S]=ℏΔS[S,S] = \hbar \Delta S.
Therefore the derivation [S,−][S,-] will not define a quantized differential and therefore the quantization of the graded-commutative dg-algebra C ∞(P)C^\infty(P) will only be a noncommutative algebra, not a non-commutative dg-algebra, hence will not be functions on a non-commutative space in derived geometry.
A Green-Schwarz mechanism (named after Michael Green and John Schwarz) is a modification of an action functional of a quantum field theory involving higher gauge fields that makes a quantum anomaly of the original action functional disappear.
More in detail:


An action functional in path integral quantization is said to be anomalous if it is only locally identified with a function on the configuration space of fields, but is globally instead a section of a line bundle (usually equipped with connection).


Given two anomalous action functionals in this sense, it may happen that while the two corresponding line bundles on configuration space are each nontrivial, their tensor product becomes trivializable. In this case one can consider the non-anomalous action function given by the sum of the two anomalous action functionals. This is what is called anomaly cancellation of one piece of an action functional against another.


The two main sources of examples for action functionals that are anomalous are


the standard fermionic action functional? (see there for details) for chiral fermions

this is a section of the Pfaffian line bundle for the Dirac operator



the action functional for differential cocycles (higher connection, higher gauge theory) in the presence of electric and magnetic charges:

this is a section of the transgression of the line bundle arising as the cup product of the electric and magnetic differential cocycles.





A Green–Schwarz mechanism is the addition of an action functional for higher differential cocycles with magnetic charges such that their quantum anomaly cancels a given Pfaffian line bundle: so it is a choice of by itself ill-defined action functional for higher gauge theory that cancels the ill-definedness of an action functional for chiral fermions.
In the more strict and original sense of the word, the Green–Schwarz mechanism is the application of this procedure in the theory called heterotic supergravity: there it so happens that the Pfaffian line bundle of the fermionic action has as Chern class the transgression of a degree-12 class in ordinary differential cohomology that factorizes as I 8∧I 4I_8 \wedge I_4. Since heterotic supergravity contains a higher gauge field that couples to strings, this is precisely of the form J electric∧J magneticJ_{electric} \wedge J_{magnetic} that the anomaly for the corresponding higher gauge theory in the presence of magnetic charges gives rise to. So the original Green–Schwarz anomaly cancellation mechanism consist of modifying the “naive” action functional for heterotic supergravity by adding the contribution that corresponds to adding a magnetic current of the form
j B:=I 4.
  j_B := I_4
  \,.


In quantum field theory
In quantum field theory an instanton is a field configuration with a “topological twist”: not in the connected component of the trivial field configurations. Specifically for gauge fields which mathematically are represented by principal connections, an instanton is a nontrivial underlying principal bundle (or similarly non-trivial associated vector bundle).
The term derives from the special case of instantons on a sphere but modeled as field configurations on a Euclidean space constrained to vanish asymptotically. These look like solutions localized in spacetime: “at an instant”.
Instantons enter the axial anomaly/chiral anomaly in the standard model of particle physics which is thought to be a source of baryogenesis in the early universe. Generally the QCD vacuum state is argued to consist of a superposition of all possible instanton sectors, see at QCD instanton.
In string theory
More generally, in string theory a brane which wraps a completely spacelike cycle in target space is called an instanton, since the worldvolume of such a brane is localized in the time-direction of target space. Under passing to the effective quantum field theory of the string theory, this reproduces many instantons in the sense of quantum field theory above.
For ConfConf a configuration space and
S:Conf→ℝ
  S : Conf \to \mathbb{R}


an action functional that is invariant under a group GG of symmetries acting on ConfConf, in that
∀g∈G,ϕ∈Conf:S(g(ϕ))=S(ϕ)
  \forall g \in G, \phi \in Conf : \,\,\, S(g(\phi)) = S(\phi)


a solution ϕ 0\phi_0 to the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion is said to exhibit spontaneously broken symmetry if it is not a fixed-point of that group action: if there is g∈Gg \in G such that g(ϕ 0)≠ϕ 0g(\phi_0) \neq \phi_0.
The “breaking” refers to the fact that the group no longer acts. It is called “spontaneous” because one imagines that by a physical process the theory “finds” one of its solutions. This comes from the class of examples where a statistical system is first considered at high temperature and then cooled down. At some point it will “spontaneously” freeze in one allowed configuration. A standard example is a ferromagnet?: at high temperature its magnetization? vanishes, while at very low temperature it spontaneously finds a direction of magnetization, thus “breaking” rotational symmetry.
One calls the subgroup G ϕ 0⊂GG_{\phi_0} \subset G that fixes the given configuration ϕ 0\phi_0 the unbroken symmetry group .
In the context of the quantum field theory arising by quantization of this action functional one considers the given classical solution ϕ 0\phi_0 as a background about which to consider perturbations of the remaining effective quantum field theory.
The fields in this effective QFT are then small excitations δϕ\delta \phi around the given ϕ 0\phi_0. Since the original symmetry group still acts on the full fields ϕ 0+δϕ\phi_0 + \delta \phi, the remaining symmetry group of the effective field theory is G ϕ 0G_{\phi_0}, whose elements gg send
g:(ϕ 0+δϕ)↦g(ϕ 0)+g(δϕ)=ϕ 0+gδϕ.
  g : (\phi_0 + \delta \phi) \mapsto g(\phi_0) + g(\delta \phi)
  = \phi_0 + g \delta \phi
 \,.


Since in the effective theory around ϕ 0\phi_0 the vacuum state where all the δϕ\delta \phi have no excitations (or rather: are in their ground state) corresponds to ϕ 0\phi_0 itself one says in this context that a quantum theory exhibits spontaneouly broken symmetry if its vacuum state is not invariant under the pertinent symmetries .

Kaluza-Klein mechanism

weak gravity conjecture


The Kaluza-Klein mechanism, named after Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein, is the observation that pure gravity on a product spacetime X×FX \times F with fixed metric g Fg_F on FF looks on XX, as an effective field theory, like gravity coupled to Yang-Mills theory – Einstein-Yang-Mills theory – for gauge group GG the Lie group of isometries of (F,g F)(F,g_F). In particular for F=S 1F = S^1 the circle, it yields electromagnetism coupled to gravity (a “graviphoton” field, but in addition also a dilaton) – Einstein-Maxwell theory.
When applied to supergravity then this mechanism produces not just force fields but also fermionic matter in the resulting effective field theory, hence yields Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dirac theory, see the examples below at KK-reduction of 11d Supergravity. As such the KK-mechanism is not unlike the idea of geometrodynamics, according to which fundamentally there is only dynamical spacetime geometry in the form of gravity with all matter and other forces being special incarnations of this.
Since in general relativity also the size and shape of the fiber FF is dynamical, generically effective field theories arising from KK-compactification contain spurious fields parameterizing the geometry of FF. In the simplest case this is just the dilaton, encoding the total volume of FF, more generally these fields are often called the moduli fields. Since these moduli fields are not observed in experiment, naive KK-models are generically phenomenologically unviable. However, in variants of gravity such as higher dimensional supergravity there are possibilities for the moduli to obtain masses and hence for the KK-models to become viable after all. This is the problem of moduli stabilization.
The mechanism
More precisely, the Einstein-Hilbert action functional on pseudo-Riemannian metrics on a product spacetime X×FX \times F
g X×F↦S EH(g X×F)≔∫ X×FR(g X×F)dvol(g X×F)
  g_{X \times F}
   \;\mapsto\; 
   S_{EH}(g_{X \times F})
   \;\coloneqq\; 
   \int_{X \times F} R(g_{X \times F}) \, dvol(g_{X \times F})


when restricted to pseudo-Riemannian metrics of the special form
(g X×F KK(x,f))∈Sym 2(Γ(T *X×F))=(g F(f) A a(x)k a A a(x)k a g X(x)),
  \left(g^{KK}_{X \times F} \left(x,f\right) \right)
   \;\in \;
  Sym^2\left(\Gamma\left(T^* X \times F\right)\right) 
   \;=\;
   \left(
    \array{
      g_F(f) & A^a(x)k_a
      \\
      A^a(x) k_a & g_X(x)
    }
  \right)
  \,,


where {k a∈Γ(TF)}\{k_a \in \Gamma(T F)\} are a basis for the Killing vector fields of (F,g F)(F,g_F), is equivalently rewritten as
S EH(g X×F KK)=S EH(g X)+S YM(A)+S mod(g F),
  S_{EH}\left(g^KK_{X \times F}\right) 
   = 
  S_{EH}\left(g_X\right) + S_{YM}(A) + S_{mod}\left(g_F\right)
  \,,


where


the first term is the EH action of g Xg_X on XX


and the second term is the action functional of Yang-Mills theory for the connection Lie algebra-valued 1-form AA with values in the Lie algebra of the isometry Lie group GG of (F,g F)(F,g_F);


and finally the last term is regarded as a functional on the moduli space of this ansatz: the moduli space of Riemannian metrics on the fiber.


More generally, one observes that the infinitesimal transformation of metrics g X×Fg_{X \times F} of the above form under diffeomorphisms generated by a Killing vector field (x,f)↦λ a(x)k a(f) (x,f) \mapsto \lambda^a(x) k_a(f) is given on the AA-component as follows:
ddϵA=d Xλ a+[λ,A].
  \frac{d}{d \epsilon} A  = d_X \lambda^a + [\lambda,A]  
  \,.


This is the infinitesimal form of a gauge transformation: an isomorphism in the groupoid of Lie algebra-valued forms. This means than every functional (g X×F)↦S(g X×F)(g_{X \times F}) \mapsto S(g_{X\times F}) that is invariant under diffeomorphisms will restrict on metrics of the above form to something that looks like an action functional for a gauge theory of the gauge field AA.
Moreover, all this of course remains true if the product X×FX \times F – which we may think of as the trivial FF-fiber bundle over XX – is generalized to any associated bundle E→XE \to X with fiber FF, associated to a GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X (hence such that E=P× GFE = P \times_G F), in which case the above decomposition of the metric applies locally.
Then one finds that the KK-mechanics indeed not only reproduces gauge fields and their correct dynamics from pure gravity in higher dimensions, but also the forces which they exert on test particles. For instance the trajectory of a charged particle subject to the Lorentz force exerted by an electromagnetic field in dd-dimensional spacetime is in fact a geodesic in the field of pure gravity of the total space of the corresponding KK-un-compactified circle principal bundle. See (Bleecker 81) or (Bartlett 13) for a pedagogical discussion of this effect.
A pseudo-Riemannian manifold of this form (E,g E KK)\left(E, g^KK_{E}\right) for fixed moduli g Fg_F is called a Kaluza-Klein compactification of the spacetime EE. One also speaks of the effective spacetime XX as being obtained by dimensional reduction from the spacetime EE.
(Beware that the term “compactification” here is vaguely related to but rather different from the use of the term in mathematics, as in one-point compactification etc.).
Its application in theoretical physics
Various evident generalizations of this ansatz can and are being considered.
Most notably for actual model building in physics it is of interest to consider the case where g Xg_{X} and AA are not necessarily constant along the fiber FF. Typically in applications these fields are expanded in terms of Fourier modes on FF. The coefficients of the higher modes appear as massive fields in the effective KK-action functional. They are called the higher Kaluza-Klein modes . These masses are inversely proportional to the metric volume of FF. For physical model building this volume is therefore chosen to be very small, such that it implies that the model does not predict the observation of the quanta of these massive modes in existing accelerator experiments (such as the LHC).
On the other hand, the extra moduli fields g Fg_F do not acquire effective masses on XX this way. Therefore models in plain Kaluza-Klein theory are trivially ruled out by experiment: for any choice of FF they predicts the observation on XX of these massless moduli fields, which however are not being seen in actual accelerator experiments.
Therefore if in a model for fundamental physics the Kaluza-Klein mechanism is invoked as a way to explain the existence of the standard model of particle physics in Yang-Mills theory from pure gravity, then the setup needs to be further generalized: other ingredients of the model need to be introduced that serve to equip the moduli fields with an effective potential with a positive minimum, such that these fields to acquire an effective mass on XX.
In physics model building the problem of constructing such a more general KK-model is called the moduli stabilization problem . (See also at landscape of string theory vacua.)
Formalization
KK-compactification along trivial fibrations is closely related to forming mapping stacks: if Fields n\mathbf{Fields}_n is the moduli stack of fields for an nn-dimensional field theory (see at prequantum field theory for more on this), then for Σ k\Sigma_{k} a kk-dimensional manifold with k<nk \lt n the mapping stack
Fields n−k≔[Σ k,Fields]
  \mathbf{Fields}_{n-k} \coloneqq [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{Fields}]


may be thought of as the moduli stack of fields for an (n−k)(n-k)-dimensional field theory. By the definition universal property of the mapping stack, this lower dimensional field theory is then such that a field configuration over an (n−k)(n-k)-dimensional spacetime X n−kX_{n-k}
ϕ:X n−k⟶Fields n−k
  \phi \colon X_{n-k} \longrightarrow \mathbf{Fields}_{n-k}


is equivalently a field configuration of the nn-dimensional field theory
X n−k×Σ k⟶Fields n
  X_{n-k} \times \Sigma_k \longrightarrow \mathbf{Fields}_n


on the product space X n−k×Σ kX_{n-k}\times \Sigma_k (the trivial Σ k\Sigma_{k}-fiber bundle over X n−kX_{n-k}).
Traditionally KK-reduction is understood as retaining only parts of Fields n−k\mathbf{Fields}_{n-k} (the “0-modes” of fields on Σ k\Sigma_k only) but of course one may consider arbitrary corrections to this picture and eventually retain the full information.
One example of KK-reduction where the full mapping stack appears is the reduction of topologically twisted N=4 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory on a complex curve CC as it appears in the explanation of geometric Langlands duality as a special case of S-duality (Witten 08, section 6). Here Fields 4=BG conn\mathbf{Fields}_4 = \mathbf{B}G_{\mathrm{conn}} is the universal moduli stack of GG-principal connections (or rther that of GG-Higgs bundles).
Models of theoretical physics are often given in the form of differential equations. Informally, integrability is the property of a concrete model which enables one to solve these equations in a closed form, or in terms of quadratures (expressions in terms of ordinary integrals).
The Kyōto school of mathematical physics (Jimbo, Miwa, Sato etc.) in mid 1970-s discovered a nontrivial connection between the theory of isomonodromic deformations of differential equations (and closely related integrable systems) and the theory of a special class of quantum field theories (whose construction heavily relies upon Clifford algebras and Clifford groups?). This subject lives under the title holonomic quantum fields. The work is also relevant to the study of Painlevé transcendents.

Through recent study of the problems in mathematical physics, a deep, unexpected link has emerged: a link between the monodromy preserving deformation theory for linear (ordinary and partial) differential equations, and a class of quantum field operators ([1][2] [3]). The aim of this article is to give an overview to the present stage of development in the theory (see also [4]).
The fruit of the above link is multifold. On the one hand it enables one to compute exactly the nn point correlation functions of the field in question in a closed form, using solutions to certain non-linear differential equations of specific type (such as the Painlevé equations). On the other hand it provides an effective new tool of describing the deformation theory by means of quantum field operators. Thus it stands as a good example of the fact that not only the pure mathematics is applied to physical problems but also the converse is true.

A topological quantum field theory is a quantum field theory which – as a functorial quantum field theory – is a functor on a flavor of the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms Bord n SBord_n^S, where the n-morphisms are cobordisms without any non-topological further structure SS – for instance no Riemannian metric structure – but possibly some “topological structure”, such as Spin structure or similar.
For more on the general idea and its development, see FQFT and extended topological quantum field theory.

Remark
Often topological quantum field theories are just called topological field theories and accordingly the abbreviation TQFT is reduced to TFT. Strictly speaking this is a misnomer, which is however convenient and very common. It should be noted, however, that TQFTs may have classical counterparts which would better deserve to be called TFTs. But they are not usually.

level (Chern-Simons theory)

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory in dimension nn is the topological sigma-model quantum field theory whose target space is the classifying space of a discrete group and whose background gauge field is a circle n-bundle with connection on BG\mathbf{B}G (necessarily flat) which is equivalently a cocycle in the group cohomology of GG with coefficients in the circle group.
Viewed in a broader context and generalizing: Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is the ∞-Chern-Simons theory induced from a characteristic class c:BG→B nU(1)\mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) on a discrete ∞-groupoid BG:=DiscBG\mathbf{B}G := Disc B G. If GG here is an ordinary discrete group this is traditional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, if GG is a discrete 2-group and the background field is a circle 4-bundle, then this is called the Yetter model.
This are the first two steps in filtering of target spaces by homotopy type truncation of ∞-Chern-Simons theory with discrete target spaces.
Concise survey of the ingredients
We may think of this as describing the quantum mechanics of an (n−1)(n-1)-brane with nn-dimensional worldvolume Σ\Sigma propagating on BGB G and being charged under a higher analog of the electromagnetic field:
a field configuration over Σ\Sigma (a Σ\Sigma-shaped trajectory) is a morphism ϕ:Σ→BG\phi : \Sigma \to \mathbf{B}G, hence equivalently a GG-principal bundle on Σ\Sigma. The configuration space of fields over Σ\Sigma is the groupoid of GG-principal bundles over Σ\Sigma.
The background gauge field is a morphism α:BG→B nU(1)\alpha : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) – hence a characteristic class for GG: a cocycle of degree nn in the group cohomology of GG.
The value of the Lagrangian L(ϕ)L(\phi) on a field configuration ϕ\phi is the characteristic class of this bundle with respect to the universal characteristic class of the given circle n-bundle:
L:(Σ→ϕBG)↦(α(ϕ):Σ→ϕBG→αB nU(1)).
  L : (\Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbf{B}G)
  \mapsto
  (\alpha(\phi) : \Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} \mathbf{B}G \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} \mathbf{B}^n U(1)).


This is the classical field theory input of the model. The extended quantum field theory defined by this is supposed to be a rule that assigns space of states to lower dimensional pieces of Σ\Sigma and to nn-dimensional Σ\Sigmas a propagator.
The space of states assigned to a Σ\Sigma of dimension n−kn-k for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} is the k-groupoid of sections of the higher line bundle associated to the circle (n-k)-bundle τ Σα\tau_\Sigma \alpha obtained by transgression of α\alpha to the mapping space H(Σ,BG)\mathbf{H}(\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G).
The propagator on Σ\Sigma of dimension nn is given by the path integral computed with measure the groupoid cardinality of BG\mathbf{B}G and integral kernel given by the action functional
exp(iS(−)):GBund(Σ)→U(1)
  \exp(i S(-)) : G Bund(\Sigma) \to U(1)


that sends a field ϕ\phi to the evaluation of α(ϕ)\alpha(\phi) on the fundamental class of Σ\Sigma
exp(iS(ϕ))=∫ Σα(ϕ).
  \exp(i S(\phi)) = \int_\Sigma \alpha(\phi)
  \,.


Gentle exposition

level (Chern-Simons theory)

The words “Chern–Simons theory” (after Shiing-shen Chern and James Simons who have their names attached to the Chern-Simons elements and Chern-Simons forms and Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle involved) can mean various things to various people, but it generally refers to the three-dimensional topological quantum field theory whose configuration space is the space of GG-principal bundles with connection on a bundle and whose Lagrangian is given by the Chern-Simons form of such a connection (for simply connected GG), or rather, more generally, whose action functional is given by the higher holonomy of the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle.
In other words, for GG a Lie group, Chern-Simons theory is a sigma-model TQFT whose target space is the smooth moduli stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of GG-principal connections, and whose background gauge field is a circle 3-bundle with connection on BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn}. The higher Chern class/Dixmier-Douady class of this three bundle is the level of the Chern-Simons theory. For GG semisimple this is the ∞-Chern-Simons theory induced from the canonical Chern-Simons element on a semisimple Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.
For the special case that GG is a discrete group the theory reduces to the (much simpler) Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
The Chern-Simons TQFT was introduced in (Witten 1989).
Tunneling between vacua – instanton Floer homology
For gg a fixed Riemannian metric on the 3-dimensional base space Σ\Sigma, the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons theory action functional S CS:Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)→ℝS_{CS} : \Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R} with respect to the respective Hodge inner product metric on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}) characterizes Yang-Mills instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills theory on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} with metric g⊗Ig \otimes I.
This phenomenon is captured by instanton Floer homology.
As an effective background for topological string theory
In (Witten94) an argument was given that Chern-Simons theory can be understood as the effective target space string theory of the A-model or B-model TCFT. This argument has later been made more precise in the language of TCFT. See TCFT – Effective background theories for more on this.
As 3-dimensional gravity
The Chern-Simons action functional for the case that the gauge group is the Poincare group Iso(2,1)Iso(2,1) (and the invariant polynomial is taken to be the one that pairs a translation generator with a rotation generator) happens to be equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the first order formulation of gravity in 3-dimensions.
Moreover, Chern-Simons theory for the groups Iso(2,2)Iso(2,2) and Iso(3,1)Iso(3,1) is similarly equivalent to gravity with cosmological constant in 3-dimensions.
Since the quantization of Chern-Simons theory is fairly well understood, these identifications imply indeed a definition of quantum gravity in 3-dimensions.
More on this is at Chern-Simons gravity.
Beware that there is a subtlety in the definition of the configuration space: when the field of gravity is identified with an Iso(2,1)Iso(2,1)-connection then the configuration space naturally contains degenerate vielbein fields EE (notably the 0 vielbein) and hence the induced rank-2 tensor g=⟨E⊗E⟩g = \langle E \otimes E\rangle may also be degenerate. Such degenerate tensors are not technically pseudo-Riemannian metric tensors, since these are required to be non-degenerate. The genuine non-degenerate metric tensors correspond to precisely those Iso(2,1)Iso(2,1)-principal connections which are in fact (O(2,1)↪Iso(2,1))(O(2,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(2,1))-Cartan connections.
However, the quantum theory exists nicely if one allows the larger configuration space of possibly degenerate metrics exists nicely, while the constrained one does not. This may be interpreted as saying that at least for purposes of quantum gravity it is wrong require non-degenerate metric tensors.

Chern–Simons theory and modular forms
Trying to interest your number theory friends with Chern–Simons theory? How about this: the Chern–Simons path integral Z(k)Z(k) above is (in a certain precise sense) a modular form. This correspondence between the Chern–Simons quantum invariants and modular forms sheds light in both directions, and is a fascinating idea to me. The key words here (which I don’t understand) are “Eichler integral” and “mock theta function?”. See:

The Morse theory of Chern–Simons theory
In a recent talk, Witten outlined a new approach to Chern–Simons theory which perhaps gives an alternative nonperturbative definition of the path integral. Quoting from Not Even Wrong:

The main new idea that Witten was using was that the contributions of different critical points p (including complex ones), could be calculated by choosing appropriate contours 𝒞 p\mathcal{C}_p using Morse theory for the Chern–Simons functional. This sort of Morse theory involving holomorphic Morse functions gets used in mathematics in Picard-Lefshetz theory?. The contour is given by the downward flow from the critical point, and the flow equation turns out to be a variant of the self-duality equation that Witten had previously encountered in his work with Kapustin on geometric Langlands. One tricky aspect of all this is that the contours one needs to integrate over are sums of the 𝒞 p\mathcal{C}_p with integral coefficients and these coefficients jump at “Stokes curves” as one varies the parameter in one’s integral (in this case, x=k/nx=k/n, kk and nn are large). In his talk, Witten showed the answer that he gets for the case of the figure-eight knot.

For slides of Witten’s talk, click here and for video, click here. Pilfering material from the slides, the basic idea is as follows. Consider a general oscillatory integral in nn dimensions:
I(λ)=∫ ℝ nd nexp(iλf(x 1,…,x n)).
 I(\lambda) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} d^n exp(i\lambda f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)).


We want to make sense of the integral when the function ff is allowed to take on imaginary values (naively, the integral diverges). To do this, we use Morse theory: we choose as our Morse function the real part of the exponent, that is h=ℜ(iλf)h = \Re(i \lambda f). For every critical point pp of hh, the descending manifold C pC_p is an nn-cycle in the relative homology group H n(X,X ≪0)H_n (X, X_{\ll0}). (Basically this means that it’s a new “contour” for the integral). Moreover Morse theory tells us that the cycles we obtain in this way form a basis for the homology, so we can express our original cycle CC (the ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n appearing in the integral over ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n) as a linear combination of these Morse theory cycles:
C=∑ pn pC p
 C = \sum_p n_p C_p


In this way we can make sense of the integral II by {\em defining} it as the integral over these new cycles (“contours”):
I(λ)=∑ crit. pointspn pI p(λ)
 I(\lambda)  = \sum_{\text{crit. points} p} n_p I_p(\lambda)


This new definition actually converges, and makes sense. Apparantly the same technique can be used to interpret the Chern–Simons path integral in the case of complex kk. Witten argues that this viewpoint is useful if we try to interpret Chern–Simons theory as a theory of three-dimensional gravity,
Traces as a path integral?
In (Witten 89) is the observation that the “trace” occuring in the “trace of the holonomy around the knot” term in the path integral should itself be seen as a path integral. In this way one hopes to obtain a much more unified formalism. The quote is reproduced at Geometric quantization and the path integral in Chern-Simons theory.
For technical details on this see at orbit method.
Higher dimensional generalizations
One question that’s been bugging me (Ben Webster) recently is what fills in the analogy “Jones polynomial is to Chern–Simons theory as Khovanov homology is to ??”
(Urs: Answer now at Khovanov homology.)
Which is to say What 3/4-dimensional structure is Khovanov homology hinting at? I’m inclined to think there must be one, as it seems that all of the knot homologies associated by Chern–Simons theory to representations have categorifications (I have a mostly finished paper on this). Presumably these all glue together into something, possibly by a similar trick to the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction of 3-manifold invariants, but it’s not so easy for me to see how.
Realization in physical systems
Chern-Simons theory has mostly been studied as a test case example for (pre-)quantum field theories in theoretical physics and mathematics. Also in string theory it appears in various incarnations and governs the hypothetical physics of string, notably through its holographic relation to the WZW model and the higher dimensional generalizations of this.
But there are also physical systems that one can set up in a laboratory experiment which are described by at least some aspects of Chern-Simons theory at least in some limit. The most prominent such example is the quantum Hall effect system in solid state physics, which consists of electrons constrained to an effectively 2-dimensional surface and subject to perpendicular magnetic field. This system and its variant are also being proposed as supporting topological quantum computing.
The term topological conformal field theory (TCFT) is used for a linearization or stabilization of something that is like a conformal field theory (CFT) up to homotopy. It is a notion somewhere half-way between a (2-dimensional) TQFT and a CFT.

(Actually, the remnant of conformal structure here should be just an artefact of the way to parameterize the moduli space of surfaces. As the classification result by Lurie discussed below shows, TCFTs are really (∞,2)(\infty,2)-TFTs.)

This formalizes the physics notion of “the topological string”, a topologically twisted superconformal field theory, such as, notably, the A-model and the B-model. TCFTs are therefore a tool for formalizing homological mirror symmetry.
Recall that an ordinary conformal field theory (CFT) is, in FQFT-language, a symmetric monoidal functor on a category Bord 2 confBord_2^{conf} whose objects are disjoint unions of intervals and circles, and whose morphisms are Riemann surfaces with these 1d manifolds as incoming and outgoing punctures.
Since Riemann surfaces form a well-understood moduli space, one can turn this also into a Top-enriched category, i.e. an (∞,1)-category, Bord 2 conf,topBord_{2}^{conf,top} whose hom-spaces are these moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with given 1d manifolds as incoming and outgoing punctures.
A “truly topological conformal field theory” would be an (∞,1)-functor of the form
Bord 2 conf,top→∞Grpd
  Bord_2^{conf,top} \to \infty Grpd


or similar. But what is actually called a “topological conformal field theory” is the linearization or stabilization of this:
in a TCFT, this (∞,1)-category of conformal cobordisms is replaced by a stable (∞,1)-category whose hom-objects (when modeled by a dg-category) are just the homology chain complexs of the original hom-spaces.
Write Bord 2 conf,dgBord_2^{conf,dg} for the resulting symmetric monoidal dg-category of Riemann cobordisms. Then a TCFT is a an homotopy-symmetric monoidal chain complex-enriched functor
F:Bord 2 conf,dg→Ch •
  F : Bord_2^{conf,dg} \to Ch_\bullet


to the symmetric monoidal dg-category of chain complexes.
This means in particular that when two Riemann surfaces Σ 1\Sigma_1 and Σ 2\Sigma_2 are homologous as chains in the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, then the TCFT will send them to two equivalent morphisms f Σ 1f_{\Sigma_1} and f Σ 2f_{\Sigma_2} of chain complexes between the in- and the output states. The equivalence between f Σ 1f_{\Sigma_1} and f Σ 2f_{\Sigma_2}, however, is not unique neither up to equivalence. Rather, it funtorially depends on the 1-chain realizing the homology equivalence between Σ 1\Sigma_1 and Σ 2\Sigma_2 as 0-chains in the moduli space. In particular, two non-homologous 1-chains between Σ 1\Sigma_1 and Σ 2\Sigma_2 will in general lead to non-equivalent equivalences between f Σ 1f_{\Sigma_1} and f Σ 2f_{\Sigma_2}.
According to ClassTFT the original definition of the domain for TCFTs can be formulated as follows (without reference to any conformal or Riemann structure).
Definition The (∞,2)(\infty,2)-category Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 of non-compact 2-dimensional cobordism is defined as follows:


The objects of Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 are oriented 0-manifolds.


Given a pair of objects X,Y∈Bord 2 ncX, Y \in Bord^{nc}_2 , a 1-morphism from XX to YY is an oriented bordism B:X→YB : X \to Y.


Given a pair of 1-morphsims B,B′:X→YB,B' : X \to Y in Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2, a 2-morphism from BB to B′B' in Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 is an oriented bordism Σ:B→B′\Sigma: B \to B' (which is trivial along XX and YY) with the following property: every connected component of Σ\Sigma has nonempty intersection with B′B'.


Higher morphisms in Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 are given by (orientation preserving) diffeomorphisms, isotopies between diffeomorphisms, and so forth.


Then, the cobordism hypothesis-theorem for Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 becomes

Theorem
Let CC be a symmetric monoidal (∞,2)-category. Then symmetric monoidal (∞,2)-functors
Z:Bord 2 nc→C
  Z : Bord^{nc}_2 \to C


are equivalent to Calabi-Yau objects AA in CC: the functor ZZ sends the point to AA.

This is ClassTFT, theorem 4.2.11. One can “unfold” Bord 2 ncBord^{nc}_2 and the theorem above, obtaining a statement in terms of symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-categories. Actually it was the unfolded version to be proven first, (Costello 04).
in the particular case C=Ch •C=Ch_\bullet. We state it below in the general version given by Jacob Lurie in ClassTFT.

Definition
Let 𝒪𝒞\mathcal{OC} be the (infinity,1)-category of open-closed strings, described as follows:


objects are oriented 1-manifolds with boundary;


morphisms are oriented bordisms between 1-manifolds such that each connected component has non-vanishing intersection with the codomain 1-manifold;


the higher morphisms are given by orientation preserving diffeomorphisms, isotopies between these, and so forth.


Write 𝒪\mathcal{O} for the full sub-(∞,1)-category on disjoint unions of intervals (open strings sector).

This is ClassTFT, above theorem 4.2.13.

level (Chern-Simons theory)

What is called the A-model topological string is the 2-dimensional topological conformal field theory corresponding to the Calabi–Yau category called the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold (X,ω)(X,\omega). This is the Poisson sigma-model of the underlying Poisson manifold after appropriate gauge fixing (AKSZ 97, p 19). The A-model on XX is effectively the Gromov–Witten theory of XX.
The A-model arose in formal physics from considerations of superstring-propagation on Calabi-Yau spaces: it may be motivated by considering the vertex operator algebra of the 2dSCFT given by the supersymmetric sigma-model with target space XX and then deforming it such that one of the super-Virasoro generators squares to 00. The resulting “topologically twisted” algebra may then be read as being the BRST complex of a TCFT.
One can also define an A-model for Landau–Ginzburg models. The category of D-branes for the corresponding open string theory is given by the Fukaya–Seidel category.
By homological mirror symmetry, the A-model is dual to the B-model.
Lagrangian
The action functional of the A-model is that associated by AKSZ theory to a Lagrangian submanifold in a target symplectic Lie n-algebroid which is the Poisson Lie algebroid of a symplectic manifold.
See the references on Lagrangian formulation.
Boundary theory / holography
On coisotropic branes in symplectic target manifolds that arise by complexification of phase spaces, the boundary path integral of the A-model computes the quantization of that phase space. For details see

quantization via the A-model.

and

holographic principle.

Second quantization / effective background field theory
The second quantization effective background field theory defined by the perturbation series of the A-model string has been argued to be Chern-Simons theory. (Witten 92, Costello 06)
For more on this see at TCFT – Worldsheet and effective background theories. A related mechanism is that of world sheets for world sheets.

level (Chern-Simons theory)

Witten introduced two topological twists of a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model, which is a certain N=2 superconformal field theory attached to a compact Calabi-Yau variety XX. One of them is the B-model topological string; it is a 2-dimensional topological N=1 superconformal field theory. In Kontsevich’s version, instead of SCFT with Hilbert space, one assembles all the needed data in terms of Calabi-Yau A-infinity-category which is the A-infinity-category of coherent sheaves on the underlying variety. In fact only the structure of a derived category is sufficient (and usually quoted): it is now known (by the results of Dmitri Orlov and Valery Lunts) that under mild assumptions on the variety, a derived category of coherent sheaves has a unique enhancement.
The B-model arose in considerations of superstring-propagation on Calabi–Yau varieties: it may be motivated by considering the vertex operator algebra of the 2dSCFT given by the N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model with target XX and then changing the fields so that one of the super-Virasoro generators squares to 0. The resulting “topologically twisted” algebra may then be read as being the BRST complex of a TCFT.
One can also define a B-model for Landau?Ginzburg models. The category of D-branes for the string – the B-branes – is given by the category of matrix factorizations (this was proposed by Kontsevich and elaborated by Kapustin-Li; see also papers of Orlov). For the genus 0 closed string theory, see the work of Saito.
By homological mirror symmetry, the B-model is dual to the A-model.
Second quantization / effective background field theory
The second quantization effective field theory defined by the perturbation series of the B-model is supposed to be “Kodaira-Spencer gravity” / “BVOC theory” in 6d (BCOV 93, Costello-Li 12, Costello-Li 15).
For more on this see at TCFT – Worldsheet and effective background theories.
To every complex 3-dimensional Calabi-Yau variety XX are associated two similar but differing types of sigma-model N=2N=2-supersymmetric 2d CFTs. There is at least for some CY XX a map X↦X^X \mapsto \hat X which exchanges the Hodge numbers h 1,1h^{1,1} and h 1,2h^{1,2} such that SCFT A(X)SCFT_A(X) is expected to be equivalent to SCFT B(X^)SCFT_B(\hat X).
SCFT A(X)≃SCFT B(X^).
  SCFT_A(X) \simeq SCFT_B(\hat X)
  \,.


This is called mirror symmetry. At least in some cases this can be understood as a special case of T-duality (Strominger-Yau-Zaslow 96).
In this form mirror symmetry remains a conjecture, not the least because for the moment there is no complete construction of these SCFTs. But to every such SCFT(X)SCFT(X) one can associate two TCFTs, A(X)A(X) and B(X)B(X), the A-model and the B-model. These N=1N=1 supersymmetric field theories were obtained by Edward Witten using a “topological twist”. The topological A-model can be expressed in terms of symplectic geometry of a variety and the topological B-model can be expressed in terms of the algebraic geometry of a variety.
These topological theories are easier to understand and do retain a little bit of the information encoded in the full SCFTs. In terms of these the statement of mirror symmetry says that passing to mirror CYs exchanges the A-model with the BB-model and conversely:
A(X)≃B(X^),B(X)≃A(X^).
  A(X) \simeq B(\hat X),\,\,\,\,\,\,\,B(X)\simeq A(\hat X)
  \,.


By a version of the cobordism hypothesis-theorem, these TCFTs (see there) are encoded by A-∞ categories that are Calabi-Yau categories: the A-model by the Fukaya category Fuk(X)Fuk(X) of XX which can be understood as a stable (∞,1)-category representing the Lagrangian intersection theory on the underlying symplectic manifold; and the B-model by an enhancement of the derived category of coherent sheaves D ∞ b(X^)D^b_\infty(\hat X) on X^\hat X.
In terms of this data, mirror symmetry is the assertion that these A-∞ categories are equivalent and simultaneously the same under exchange X↔X^X\leftrightarrow \hat{X}:
Fuk(X)≃D ∞ b(X^),andFuk(X^)≃D ∞ b(X).
  Fuk(X) \simeq D^b_\infty(\hat{X}),
\,\,\,\, and \,\,\,\,
Fuk(\hat{X}) \simeq D^b_\infty(X).


This categorical formulation was introduced by Maxim Kontsevich in 1994 under the name homological mirror symmetry. The equivalence of the categorical expression of mirror symmetry to the SCFT formulation has been proven by Maxim Kontsevich and independently by Kevin Costello, who showed how the datum of a topological conformal field theory is equivalent to the datum of a Calabi-Yau A-∞-category(see TCFT).
The mirror symmetry conjecture roughly claims that every Calabi-Yau 3-fold has a mirror. In fact one considers (mirror symmetry for) degenerating families for Calabi-Yau 3-folds in large volume limit (which may be expressed precisely via the Gromov-Hausdorff metric). The appropriate definition of (an appropriate version of) the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold is difficult to achieve in desired generality. Invariants/tools of Fukaya category include symplectic Floer homology and Gromov-Witten invariants (building up the quantum cohomology).
Mirror symmetry is related to the T-duality on each fiber of an associated Lagrangian fibration Strominger-Yau-Zaslow 96.
Although the non-Calabi-Yau case may be of lesser interest to physics, one can still formulate some mirror symmetry statements for, for instance, Fano manifolds. The mirror to a Fano manifold is a Landau-Ginzburg model (see Hori-Vafa 00; see also work of Auroux for an explanation via the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow T-duality philosophy). Then the statements are: the A-model of the Fano (given by the Fukaya category) is equivalent to the B-model of the Landau-Ginzburg model (given by the category of matrix factorizations); and the B-model of the Fano (given by the derived category of sheaves) is equivalent to the A-model of the Landau-Ginzburg model (given by the Fukaya-Seidel category). A few of the relevant names: Kontsevich, Hori-Vafa, Auroux, Katzarkov, Orlov, Seidel, …
Relation to tropical geometry.
Close relation to tropical geometry, see e.g. Gross 11.
A (pre-)quantum field theory with defects is, roughly a field theory that assigns data not just to plain manifolds/cobordisms, but to spaces that may carry certain singularities and/or colorings. At the locus of such a singularity the bulk field theory may then undergo transitions.
Such defects are known by many names. In codimension 1 they are often called domain walls. If they are boundaries they are often called branes, the corresponding domain walls are then sometimes called bi-branes. Examples of Dimension-1 defects are Wilson lines and cosmic strings (at least in gauge theory) and dimension-0 defects are often called monopoles.
General
A plain nn-dimensional local FQFT (a bulk field theory) is a symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-functor from the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms.
Z:Bord n→𝒞 ⊗.  
  Z : Bord_n \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes
  \,.


If one replaces plain cobordisms here with cobordisms Bord n DefBord_n^{Def} “with singularities” including boundaries and corners but also partitions labeled in a certain index set DefDef, one calls a morphism
Z:Bord n Def→𝒞
  Z : Bord_n^{Def} \to \mathcal{C}


a TQFT with defects. A general formalization is in (Lurie, section 4.3), see at Cobordism theorem – For cobordisms with singuarities (boundaries/branes and defects/domain walls). See also (Davydov-Runkel-Kong and Carqueville-Runkel-Schaumann).
Such a morphism carries data as follows:


for each label in DefDef of codimension 0 there is an ordinary bulk field theory;


for each label in DefDef of codimension 1 data on how to “connect” the two TQFTs on both sides


etc.


So one may think of the codimension kk colors as defects where the TQFT that one is looking at changes its nature.
In particular, when the QFT on one side of the defect is trivial, then the defect behaves like a boundary condition for the remaining QFT. Since at least for n=2n=2 QFT such boundary conditions are also called branes, defects are also called bi-branes.
The statement of the cobordism theorem with singularities (Lurie, theorem 4.3.11) is essentially the following:
Given a symmetric monoidal (∞,n)-category 𝒞 ⊗\mathcal{C}^\otimes, then for every choice of pasting diagram of k-morphisms for all kk, there is a type of manifolds with singularity DefDef, such that Bord n DefBord_n^Def is the free symmetric monoidal (∞,n)(\infty,n)-category on this data, hence such that TFTs with defects (Bord n Def) ⊗→𝒞 ⊗(Bord_n^Def)^\otimes \to \mathcal{C}^\otimes are equivalently given by realizing such a pasting diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, where each of the given k-morphism appears as the value of a codimension (n−k)(n-k)-defect. (See also Lurie, remark 4.3.14).
Topological defects from spontaneously broken symmetry

under construction

An old notion of defects in field theory – well preceeding the above general notion in the context of FQFT – is that of topological defects in the vacuum structure of gauge theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking (such as a Higgs mechanism).
A comprehensive review in in (Vilenkin-Shellard 94. Steps towards conceptually systematizing these broken-symmetry defects and their interaction are made in Preskill-Vilenkin 92. We now discuss this may be translated to and formalized in the general FQFT definition above along the lines of (Fiorenza-Valentino, FSS).
Let GG be a Lie group, to be thought of as the (local or global) gauge group of some gauge theory. Let H↪GH \hookrightarrow G a subgroup, to be thought of as the subgroup of global symmetries preserved by some vacuum configuration (which “spontaneously breaks” the symmetry from GG to HH, the archetypical example is the Higgs mechanism).
Then the space of such vacuum configurations is the coset space G/HG/H. So given a manifold XX (spacetime), vacuum configuratons are given by functions X→G/HX \to G/H. Hence G/H 1G/H_1 is the “moduli space of vacua” or “vacuum space” in this context.
The functions X→G/HX \to G/H are to be smooth functions in the bulk of spacetime. If they are allowed to be non-smooth or even non-continuous along given strata of XX, then these are called defects in the sense of broken gauge symmetry.
In particular (with counting adapted to dimX=4dim X = 4)


if X→G/HX \to G/H is not smooth but is smooth on the pre-image of each element of π 0(G/H)\pi_0(G/H) and becomes a smooth function on X−S 1X-S_1 where S 1↪XS_1 \hookrightarrow X is a codimension-1 submanifold, then S 1S_1 is said to be a domain wall for vacuum configurations.


if X→G/HX \to G/H is not smooth but becomes smooth on X−S 2X-S_2, where S 2S_2 is a codimension-2 submanifold, then S 2S_2 is calld a cosmic string-defect of the vacuum configurations;


if X→G/HX \to G/H is not smooth but becomes smooth on X−S 3X-S_3, where S 3S_3 is a codimension-3 submanifold, then S 3S_3 is calld a monopole-defect of the vacuum configurations.



hm, need to fine-tune the technical conditions here, to make the following statement come out right…

So


domain walls can appear when π 0(G/H)\pi_0(G/H) is non-trivial;


cosmic strings can appear when π 1(G/H)\pi_1(G/H) is non-trivial;


monopoles can appear when π 2(G/H)\pi_2(G/H) is non-trivial.


Next consider a sequence of subgroups
H 2↪H 1↪H 0≔G
  H_2 \hookrightarrow H_1 \hookrightarrow H_0 \coloneqq G


to be thought of as coming from two consecutive steps of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the first one down to H 1H_1 at some energy-scale E 1E_1, and the second at some lower energy scale E 2<E 1E_2 \lt E_1.
Then we say that vacuum defects at energy E 2E_2 of codimension-kk which wind around an element π k(H 1/H 2)\pi_k(H_1/H_2) are metastable if they become unstable at energy E 1E_1, hence if their image in π k(H 0/H 2)\pi_k(H_0/H_2) is trivial.
So if we add to the singular cobordism category the kk-morphism which is the kk-dimenional unit cube with an open kk-ball removed, then the boundary field data for metastable codimension n−kn-k-defects is
[0,1] k−D k → Π(H 1/H 2) ↓ ⇙ ↓ [0,1] k → Π(H 0/H 2) → Π(H 0/H 1)
  \array{
     [0,1]^k - D^k &\to & \Pi(H_1/H_2)
     \\
     \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
     \\
     [0,1]^k &\to& \Pi(H_0/H_2) &\to& \Pi(H_0/H_1)
  }


we have a homotopy fiber sequence
Π(H 1/H 2)→Π(H 0/H 2)→Π(H 0/H 1).
  \Pi(H_1/H_2) \to \Pi(H_0/H_2) \to \Pi(H_0/H_1)
  \,.


This induces a long exact sequence of homotopy groups
⋯→π k+1(H 0/H 1)→π k(H 1/H 2)→π k(H 0/H 2)→π k(H 0/H 1)→π k−1(H 1/H 2)→⋯.
   \cdots \to \pi_{k+1}(H_0/H_1) \to \pi_k(H_1/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_1)
  \to 
  \pi_{k-1}(H_1/H_2) \to \cdots
  \,.


So for every metastable defect of codimension n−kn-k given by c∈ker(π k(H 1/H 2)→π k(H 0/H 2))c \in ker(\pi_k(H_1/H_2) \to \pi_k(H_0/H_2)) there is an element in π k+1(H 0/H 1)\pi_{k+1}(H_0/H_1) of one codimension higher. One says (Preskill-Vilenkin 92) that the codimenion (n−k)(n-k)-defect may end on that codimension (n−k−1)(n-k-1)-defect.
(…)
In order to formalize this we introduce, following the cobordism theorem with singularities, cells in Span n(H)Span_n(\mathbf{H}) which label spontaneous-symmetriy-breaking defects as well as their defects-of-defects which exhibit their decay by higher codimension defects.
Consider a span of the form
[Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)] ← [Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)] → *.
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }
  \,.


Comparing this to the span that comes from the “cap” S k−1→D k←∅S^{k-1} \to D^{k} \leftarrow \emptyset in the theory at energy level E 2E_2, which is just
[Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)] ← [Π(D k),Π(H 1/H 2)] → *
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(D^{k}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }


shows that the former models a kk-disk which is not filled with spacetime, but nevertheless closes the disk. This is the defect given as a removal of a piece of spacetime.
In order to formalize how these defects may decay at higher energy, consider next a span of field configurations of the form
[Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)] ← [Π(S k),Π(H 0/H 1)] → [*,Π(H 0/H 2)].
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(S^{k}), \Pi(H_0/H_1)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    [\ast, \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
  }
  \,.


Comparing again to the span that comes from the “cap” S k−1→D k←∅S^{k-1} \to D^{k} \leftarrow \emptyset in the theory at energy level E 2E_2, which is just
[Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)] ← [Π(D k),Π(H 1/H 2)] → *
  \array{
    [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\leftarrow&
    [\Pi(D^{k}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)]
    &\rightarrow&  
    \ast
  }


shows that the former models a kk-disk whose center point carries a singularity: the fields at the bounding S k−1S^{k-1} take values in the moduli space of the ambient theory Π(H 1/H 2)\Pi(H_1/H_2), but then at the tip of the “cap” there is a “field insertion” of a field with values in Π(H 0/H 2)\Pi(H_0/H_2). Hence this labels a defect of codimension kk.
To construct such a decay-process span that captures the above story from Preskill-Vilenkin 92, consider the following diagram:
  [Π(S k),Π(H 0/H 1)]   ↓   [Π(S k−1),ΩΠ(H 0/H 1)]  ↙  ↘ [Π(S k−1),Π(H 1/H 2)]  (pb)  [Π(D k),Π(H 0/H 2)] ≃ [*,Π(H 0/H 2)]  ↘  ↙   [Π(S k−1),Π(H 0/H 2)]
  \array{
     && [\Pi(S^{k}), \Pi(H_0/H_1)]
     \\
     && \downarrow
     \\
     && [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Omega\Pi(H_0/H_1)]
     \\
     & \swarrow && \searrow
     \\
     [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_1/H_2)] && (pb) && [\Pi(D^k), \Pi(H_0/H_2)] & \simeq & [\ast, \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
     \\
     & \searrow & & \swarrow
     \\
     && [\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Pi(H_0/H_2)]
  }


This may be read as follows:


on the far left [Π(S k),Π(H 1/H 2)][\Pi(S^k), \Pi(H_1/H_2)] is the space of fields of the ambient theory at energy scale E 2E_2 around the defect;


the bottom left map is the “fluctuation” map that sends these fields to fields at the higher energy scale E 1E_1;


the bottom right map exhibt the possible “decays”: a lift through this map takes a field configuration that winds around a kk-ball and contracts it through that kk-ball, hence going forth and back through the bottom two maps corresponds to carrying a defect over the energy barrier from E 2E_2 to E 1E_1 and there having it decay away.


these decaying configurations are therefore given by the homotopy fiber product of the bottom two functions, which is [Π(S k−1),ΩΠ(H 0/H 1)][\Pi(S^{k-1}), \Omega\Pi(H_0/H_1)], as indicated. But this space is really given by field configurations at energy scale E 1E_1 that wind around a (k+1)(k+1)-ball, as shown at the very top.


Hence the top part of this diagram is a span that exhibits a defect-of-defects which tells just the story that (Preskill-Vilenkin 92) is telling: a codimension-kk defect of the low energy theory decays at higher energy, and the decay is witnessed by the appearance of a codimension (k+1)(k+1)-defect of the high energy theory.

Recall that a TQFT is an FQFT defined on the (∞,n)(\infty,n)-category of cobordisms whose morphisms are plain cobordisms and diffeomorphisms between these.
In a conformal quantum field theory the cobordisms are equipped with a conformal structure (a Riemannian metric structure modulo pointwise rescaling): conformal cobordisms.
A conformal field theory (CFT) is accordingly a functor on such a richer category of conformal cobordisms. See the discussion at FQFT for more details.
The conformally invariant quantum field theories have fields for whom the correlation functions have a specific behaviour accounting for the conformal dimension of the fields. This kind of constraints coming from conformal invariance, leads to constraints on the possible behaviour of correlation functions; this has being formulated in 1971 by Polyakov as a conformal bootstrap program: the conformal invariance should be sufficient to classify consistent conformal QFTs directly from the analysis of symmetries, rather than computing the Feynman diagram perturbation series from some action functional; this avoids the usual problems with regularization and renormalization.
Precisely in 2-dimensions is the representation theory of the conformal group exceptionally interesting. In d>2d \gt 2, the global transformations, i.e. the elements of the conformal group, are given by the Poincare algebra, dilations and special conformal transformations. In 22 dimensions, there are additionaly infinitely many local generators of conformal transformations whose commutation relations are given by the Virasoro algebra. This circumstance enables Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov to make a breakthrough in the bootstrap program in 1984 (what also helped a 1984-1985 revolution in string theory). There are well-developed tools for handling the theory locally (conformal nets, vertex operator algebras) and at least in the rational conformal field theory case there are complete classification results for the full theories (defined on cobordisms of all genera).
For this reason often in the literature the term “CFT” often implicitly refers to 2d CFT.
22-dimensional conformal field theories have two major applications:


they describe critical phenomena on surfaces in condensed matter physics;


they are the building blocks used in string theory


In the former application it is mostly the local behaviour of the CFT that is relevant. This is encoded in vertex operator algebras.
In the string theoretic applications the extension of the local theory to a full representation of the 2d conformal cobordism category is crucial. This extension is called solving the sewing constraints .

The Wess-Zumino-Witten model (or WZW model for short, also called Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model, or short WZNW model) is a 2-dimensional sigma-model quantum field theory whose target space is a Lie group.
This may be regarded as the boundary theory of Chern-Simons theory for Lie group GG.
The vertex operator algebras corresponding to the WZW model are current algebras.
According to the classification of superconformal symmetry, there should exist superconformal field theories in 6 dimensions…

…with (2,0)(2,0)-supersymmetry, that contain a self-dual higher gauge theory whose field configurations are connections on a 2-bundle (a circle 2-bundle with connection in the abelian case).
In (Claus-Kallosh-Proeyen 97) such has been derived, in the abelian case and to low order, as the small fluctuations of the Green-Schwarz sigma-model of the M5-brane around the embedding in the asymptotic boundary of the AdS-spacetime that is the near-horizon geometry of the black M5-brane.
In accord with this the AdS7-CFT6 correspondence predicts that the nonabelian 6d theory is the corresponding theory for NN coincident M5-branes.
In the non-abelian case it is expected (Witten 07) that the compactification of such theories are at the heart of the phenomenon that leads to S-duality in super Yang-Mills theory and further to geometric Langlands duality (Witten 09).
Due to the self-duality a characterization of these theories by an action functional is subtle. Therefore more direct descriptions are still under investigation (for instance SSW11). Review includes (Moore11, Moore 12).
Geometric engineering
For geometric engineering of the 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT, see at duality between M-theory on Z2-orbifolds and type IIB string theory on K3-fibrations – Geometric engineering of 6d (2,0)-SCFT.
Holographic dual
Under AdS7/CFT6 the 6d (2,0)(2,0)-superconformal QFT is supposed to be dual to M-theory on anti de Sitter spacetime AdS 7×S 4AdS_7 \times S^4.

Solitonic 1-branes
The 5d (2,0)(2,0)-SCFT has tensionless 1-brane configurations. From the point of view of the ambient 11-dimensional supergravity these are the boundaries of M2-branes ending on the M5-branes. (GGT)
Compactification on a Riemann surface and AGT correspondence




(graphics taken from (Workshop 14))

The compactification of the 5-brane on a Riemann surface yields as worldvolume theory N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory. See at N=2 D=4 SYM – Construction by compactification of 5-branes.
The AGT correspondence relates the partition function of SU(2) n+3g−3SU(2)^{n+3g-3}-N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory obtained by compactifying the 6d6d M5-brane theory on a Riemann surface C g,nC_{g,n} of genus gg with nn punctures to 2d Liouville theory on C g,nC_{g,n}.
More generally, this kind of construction allows to describe the 6d (2,0)-theory as a “2d SCFT with values in 4d SYM”. See at AGT correspondence for more on this.
Twistor space description
Famously the solutions to self-dual Yang-Mills theory in dimension 4 can be obtained as images of degree-2 cohomology classes under the Penrose-Ward twistor transform. Since the 6d QFT on the M5-brane contains a 2-form self-dual higher gauge field it seems natural to expect that it can be described by a higher analogy of the twistor transform. For references exploring this idea see at twistor space – References – Application to the self-dual 2-form field in 6d.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
In gauge theory cocycles in differential cohomology model gauge fields.
By definition, every differential cohomology theory Γ •(−)\Gamma^\bullet(-) comes with a characteristic curvature form morphism
F:Γ¯ •(X)→Ω •(X)⊗π *Γ⊗ℝ,
  F : \bar \Gamma^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)\otimes \pi_*\Gamma \otimes \mathbb{R}
  \,,


the (generalized) Chern character.
For c∈Γ •(X)c \in \Gamma^\bullet(X) a cocycle representing a gauge field in gauge theory, its image F(c)∈Ω •(X)F(c) \in \Omega^\bullet(X) is the field strength of the gauge field. If we think of this cocycle as being (a generalization of) a connection on a bundle, this is essentially the curvature of that connection.
Often gauge fields are named after their field strength. For instance the field strength of the electromagnetic field is the 22-form F∈Ω 2(X)F \in \Omega^2(X) whose components are the electric and the magnetic fields.
In physics there are (at least) two different concepts that go by the name gauge group:


a local gauge group GG is a structure group of GG-principal bundles in the configuration space of a classical gauge theory: it acts by gauge transformations on the space of field configurations.


a global gauge group is a group of automorphisms that acts on the (local net of) observables of a quantum field theory.


Notably after quantization the gauge group in the first sense does not become a gauge group in the second sense. On the contrary, observables in quantum field theory are required not to depend on gauge transformations in the first sense, and part of what makes quantization of gauge theory nontrivial is to find among all potential candidate observables those that actually are invariant under gauge transformations, i.e. under isomorphisms of principal bundles with connection in the configuration space of the gauge theory.
Global gauge group
The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in quantum field theory, where the gauge group of a physical system is the group of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable physical effects. In this sense, nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of gauge theories.
In AQFT gauge groups are introduced via a net of C-star-systems.
Local gauge groups
In Yang-Mills theory and other gauge theories the gauge groups is the structure group GG of the GG-principal bundle on which the Yang-Mills field is a connection.
Local gauge groups are visible in the Lagrangian approach to quantum field theory, where they act on the configuration space on which the action functional is a function by gauge transformations. A large machinery has been developed to handle the (path integral) quantization of action functionals on such configuration spaces. See for instance BV-BRST formalism.
We list examples of local gauge groups and ∞-groups for various higher gauge theories.


the gauge group of GG-Yang-Mills theory is the given Lie group GG; for the Yang-Mills theory appearing in the standard model of particle physics this is the unitary group U(3)×SU(2)×U(1)U(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1);


the local gauge group of gravity on a manifold XX is the Poincare group;


the gauge 2-group of the Kalb-Ramond field is the circle 2-group BU(1)=(U(1)→1)\mathbf{B} U(1) = (U(1) \to 1);


the gauge 3-group of the supergravity C-field is the circle 3-group B 2U(1)=(U(1)→1→1)\mathbf{B}^2 U(1) = (U(1) \to 1 \to 1);


the gauge group of abelian higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34 k+3 is the circle (2k+1)-group B 2kU(1)\mathbf{B}^{2k} U(1);


the 7-dimensional “fivebrane Chern-Simons theory” has as gauge 2-group the string 2-group;


the symmetry group of string field theory is some ∞-group that is not an nn-group for any finite nn;


an ∞-Chern-Simons theory has in general not only a gauge ∞-group but an ∞-groupoid of symmetries:


the Poisson sigma-model has as gauge groupoid the symplectic groupoid that is the Lie integration of the given Poisson Lie algebroid;


the Courant sigma-model has as gauge 2-groupoid the symplectic 2-groupoid that integrates the given Courant Lie 2-algebroid;


generally, the AKSZ sigma-model in grade nn has as gauge ∞\infty-groupoid a symplectic Lie n-groupoid.




Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
See A first idea of quantum field theory the chapter Gauge fixing.
The electromagnetic field is is a gauge field which unifies the electric field and the magnetic field. A configuration of the electromagnetic field on a space XX in the absence of magnetic charge is modeled by a cocycle F^\hat F in degree 2 ordinary differential cohomology.
This may be realized in particular equivalently by


a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection on XX;


a degree 2 Deligne cocycle on XX.


In the presence of magnetic charge the electromagnetic field is modeled by a cocycle in differential twisted cohomology, where the twist is given by the differential 3-cocycle that models the magnetic current.
The analogous field modeled by a degree 3 Deligne cocycle is the Kalb-Ramond field.

Quantum electrodynamics (“QED”) is the perturbative quantum field theory of the electromagnetic field coupled to a Dirac field via the electron-photon interaction: it describes the quantum theory of photons and electrons.
The Lagrangian density defining QED is the sum of


the free field contribution of the electromagnetic field;


the free field contribution of a Dirac field;


the electron-photon interaction term with coupling constant given by the fine structure constant.


See at A first idea of quantum field theory this example.
The underlying free field theory admits a quantization via the corresponding Wick algebra. QED is, by definition, the perturbative quantum field theory obtained from this by finding a perturbative S-matrix for the electron-photon interaction.
As a result, scattering amplitudes for electron-photon interactions in QED are then expressed in terms of Feynman amplitudes:


Example
(Feynman amplitudes in causal perturbation theory – example of QED)
In perturbative quantum field theory, Feynman diagrams are labeled multigraphs that encode products of Feynman propagators, called Feynman amplitudes (this prop.) which in turn contribute to probability amplitudes for physical scattering processes – scattering amplitudes:
The Feynman amplitudes are the summands in the Feynman perturbation series-expansion of the scattering matrix
𝒮(S int)=∑k∈ℕ1k!1(iℏ) kT(S int,⋯,S int⏟kfactors)
  \mathcal{S}
  \left(

  \frac{1}{k!}
  \frac{1}{(i \hbar)^k}
  T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{S_{int}, \cdots , S_{int}}} )


of a given interaction Lagrangian density L intL_{int}.
The Feynman amplitudes are the summands in an expansion of the time-ordered products T(⋯)T(\cdots) of the interaction with itself, which, away from coincident vertices, is given by the star product of the Feynman propagator Δ F\Delta_F (this prop.), via the exponential contraction
T(S int,S int)=prod∘exp(ℏ∫Δ F ab(x,y)δδΦ a(x)⊗δδΦ(y))(S int⊗S int).
  T(S_{int}, S_{int}) 
  \;=\;

      \int \Delta_{F}^{a b}(x,y) 
        \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}^a(x)} 
          \otimes 
        \frac{\delta}{\delta \mathbf{\Phi}(y)}  
    \right) 
    ( S_{int} \otimes S_{int} )
   \,.


Each edge in a Feynman diagram corresponds to a factor of a Feynman propagator in T(S int⋯S int⏟kfactors)T( \underset{k \, \text{factors}}{\underbrace{S_{int} \cdots S_{int}}} ), being a distribution of two variables; and each vertex corresponds to a factor of the interaction Lagrangian density at x ix_i.
For example quantum electrodynamics in Gaussian-averaged Lorenz gauge involves (via this example):

Hence a typical Feynman diagram in the QED Feynman perturbation series induced by this electron-photon interaction looks as follows:



where on the bottom the corresponding Feynman amplitude product of distributions is shown; now notationally suppressing the contraction of the internal indices and all prefactors.
For instance the two solid edges between the vertices x 2x_2 and x 3x_3 correspond to the two factors of Δ(x 2,x 2)\Delta(x_2,x_2):



This way each sub-graph encodes its corresponding subset of factors in the Feynman amplitude:

A priori this product of distributions is defined away from coincident vertices: x i≠x jx_i \neq x_j. The definition at coincident vertices x i=x jx_i = x_j requires a choice of extension of distributions to the diagonal locus. This choice is the ("re-")normalization of the Feynman amplitude.

In electromagnetism the electromagnetic field is modeled by a degree 2 differential cocycle F^∈H(X,ℤ(2) D ∞)\hat F \in H(X, \mathbb{Z}(2)_D^\infty) (see Deligne cohomology) with curvature characteristic 2-form F∈Ω 2(X)F \in \Omega^2(X).
With ⋆\star denoting the Hodge star operator with respect to the corresponding pseudo-Riemannian metric on XX, the right hand of
d⋆F=j el∈Ω 3(X)
  d \star F = j_{el} \in \Omega^3(X)


is the conserved current called the electric current on XX. Conversely, with j elj_{el} prescribed this equation is one half of Maxwell's equations for FF.
If XX is globally hyperbolic and Σ⊂X\Sigma \subset X is any spacelike hyperslice, then
Q el:=∫ Σj el
  Q_{el} := \int_\Sigma j_{el}


is the charge of this current: the electric charge encoded by this configuration of the electromagnetic field.
Notice that due to the above equation dj el=0d j_{el} = 0, so that QQ is independent of the choice of Σ\Sigma. When unwrapped into separate space and time components, the expression dj el=0d j_{el} = 0 may be expressed as
divj+∂ρ∂t=0div j + \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} = 0
which is a statement of the physical phenomenon of charge conservation .
Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic field F∈Ω 2(X)F \in \Omega^2(X) on a dd-dimensional spacetime XX in the presence of electric current j el∈Ω d−1(X)j_{el} \in \Omega^{d-1}(X) read
dF=0
  d F = 0


d⋆F=j el.
  d \star F = j_{el}
  \,.


Formally this suggests an immediate generalization where a conserved current called the magnetic current j mag∈Ω 3(X)j_{mag} \in \Omega^{3}(X) is introduced and the first of the equations above is replaced by
dF=j mag.
  d F = j_{mag}
  \,.


The corresponding charge is the magnetic charge.
One thing to notice about this is that

net magnetic charge has not been observed in nature.

The other thing is a more conceptual problem: the Dirac quantization condition says that the 22-form FF is not entirely arbitrary, but constrained to be the characteristic curvature 22-form of a degree-22 cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology, for instance the curvature 22-form of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection. But this necessarily implies that dF=0d F = 0.
Indeed, to circumvent dealing with this problem Dirac, in his original argument, has considered removing from XX the support of any magnetic charge density.
It was Dan Freed in (Freed) who discussed that the global description of the electromagnetic field does make sense even in the presence of electric current if one generalizes the model of a degree-22 differential cocycle to that of a twisted cocycle.
The magnetic current 33-form j magj_{mag} is then realized as the curvature characteristic 33-form of a degree-33 cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology j^ mag\hat j_{mag}, the electromagnetic field FF is the curvature characteristic 22-form of a degree-22 twisted differential cocycle F^\hat F and the equation
dF=j mag
  d F = j_{mag}


expresses the twisting of F^\hat F by j^ mag\hat j_{mag} at the level of curvature forms.
This means that Dirac almost found bundle gerbes already in 1931, had he not discussed only the neighbourhood of magnetic monopoles.
The Yang–Mills field is the gauge field of Yang-Mills theory.
It is modeled by a cocycle F^∈H(X,BU(n) conn)\hat F \in \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}U(n)_{conn}) in differential nonabelian cohomology. Here BU(n) conn\mathbf{B} U(n)_{conn} is the moduli stack of U(n)U(n)-principal connections, the stackification of the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms, regarded as a groupoid internal to smooth spaces.
This is usually represented by a vector bundle with connection.
As a nonabelian Čech cocycle the Yang-Mills field on a space XX is represented by


a cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\}


a collection of Lie(U(n))Lie(U(n))-valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i,Lie(U(n))))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i, Lie(U(n))));


a collection of U(n)U(n)-valued smooth functions (g ij∈C ∞(U ij,U(n)))(g_{i j} \in C^\infty(U_{i j}, U(n)));


such that on double overlaps
A j=Ad g ij∘A i+g ijgg ij −1,
  A_j = Ad_{g_{i j}} \circ A_i + g_{i j} g g_{i j}^{-1}
  \,,



and such that on triple overlaps
g ijg jk=g ik.
  g_{i j} g_{j k} = g_{i k}
  \,.



Examples


For U(n)=U(1)U(n) = U(1) this is the electromagnetic field.


For U(n)=SU(2)×U(1)U(n) = SU(2) \times U(1) this is the “electroweak field”;


For U(n)=SU(3)U(n) = SU(3)  this is the strong nuclear force field.

Quantization
Despite its fundamental role in the standard model of particle physics, various details of the quantization of Yang-Mills theory are still open. See at quantization of Yang-Mills theory.
The purpose of this page is to explain - using appropriate mathematical terminology - Dirac’s theory of coupling particles with spin to a Yang-Mills gauge field.
We proceed in three steps: first we recall relevant facts about the gauge field itself, then we discuss charged particles in gauge fields, and finally we add spin.

The Kalb-Ramond field or B-field is the higher U(1)-gauge field that generalizes the electromagnetic field from point particles to strings.
Its dual incarnation in KK-compactifications of heterotic string theory to 4d is a candidate for the hypothetical axion field (Svrcek-Witten 06, p. 15).
Recall that the electromagnetic field is modeled as a cocycle in degree 2 ordinary differential cohomology and that this mathematical model is fixed by the fact that charged particles that trace out 1-dimensional trajectories couple to the electromagnetic field by an action functional that sends each trajectory to the holonomy of a U(1)U(1)-connection on it.
When replacing particles with 1-dimensional trajectories by strings with 2-dimensional trajectories, one accordingly expects that they may couple to a higher degree background field given by a degree 3 ordinary differential cohomology cocycle.
In string theory this situation arises and the corresponding background field appears, where it is called the Kalb-Ramond field .
Often it is also simply called the BB-field , after the standard symbol used for the 2-forms (B i∈Ω 2(U i))(B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i)) on patches U iU_i of a cover of spacetime when the differential cocycle is expressed in a Cech cohomology realization of Deligne cohomology.
This is the analog of the local 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i)) in a Cech cocycle presentation of a line bundle with connection encoding the electromagnetic field.
The field strength of the Kalb-Ramond field is a 3-form H∈ΩH \in \Omega. On each patch U iU_i it is given by
H| U i=dB i.
  H|_{U_i} = d B_i
  \,.


And just as a degree 2 Deligne cocycle is equivalently encoded in a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection, the degree 3 differential cocycle is equivalently encoded in


a degree 3 Deligne cocycle;


a BU(1)\mathbf{B}U(1)-principal 2-bundle with connection;


a U(1)U(1)-bundle gerbe with connection.


The study of bundle gerbes was largely motivated and driven by the desire to understand the Kalb-Ramond field.
The next higher degree analog of the electromagnetic field is the supergravity C-field.
The field content of 11-dimensional supergravity contains a higher U(1)-gauge field called the supergravity C-field or M-theory 3-form , which is locally a 3-form and globally some variant of a circle 3-bundle with connection.
There have been several suggestions for what precisely its correct global description must be, see at Models below
The RR field or Ramond–Ramond field is a gauge field appearing in 10-dimensional type II supergravity.
Mathematically the RR field on a space XX is a cocycle in differential K-theory – or rather, in full generality, in twisted differential KR-theory subject to a self-dual higher gauge field constrained encoded by a quadratic form defining an 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on twisted differential KR cocycles.
Accordingly, the field strength of the RR field, i.e. the image of the differential K-cocycle in deRham cohomology, is an inhomogeneous even or odd differential form


in type IIA string theory
F RR=R 0+R 2+⋯
  F_{RR} = R_0 + R_2 + \cdots



in type IIB string theory
F RR=R 1+R 3+⋯
  F_{RR} = R_1 + R_3 + \cdots



The components of this are sometimes called the RR forms.
In the presence of a nontrivial Kalb–Ramond field the RR field is twisted: a cocycle in the corresponding twisted K-theory.
Moreover, the RR field is constrained to be a self-dual differential K-cocycle in a suitable sense.

D1-braneD5-brane
D2-braneD4-brane
D3-braneD3-brane


The RR field derives its name from the way it shows up when the supergravity theory in question is derived as an effective background theory in string theory. From the sigma-model perspective of the string the RR field is the condensate of fermionic 0-mode excitations of the type II superstring for a particular choice of boundary conditons called the Ramond boundary condititions. Since these boundary conditions have to be chosen for two spinor components, the name appears twice.

The action functional of gravity was originally conceived as a functional on the space of pseudo-Riemannian metrics of a manifold XX. Later on it was realized that it may alternatively naturally be thought of as a functional on the space of connections with values in the Poincaré Lie algebra – subject to the constraint that the component in the translation Lie algebra defines a vielbein field.
Mathematically this means that the field of gravity is modeled as a Cartan connection for the Lorentz group inside the Poincaré group. In physics this is known as the first order formalism or the Cartan moving frame method. The translation part of the Poincaré Lie algebra-connection is called the vielbein and the remainder the spin connection. The field strength of gravity – the Riemann tensor – is the curvature.
The reformulation of pseudo-Riemannian geometry in terms of Cartan geometry is suggestive of also re-rewriting the form of the Lagrangian density/action functional of the theory of gravity, even though this is logically an independent issue. In spacetime of dimension 3+1 one such alternative is known as the Palatini-Cartan-Holst action. That its phase space coincides with that induced by the Einstein-Hilbert action is due to Cattaneo-Schiavina 17a
Promoting the first-order formulation of gravity from the Poincaré group to the super Poincaré group yields supergravity formulated in super Cartan geometry. Promoting it further to the Lie n-algebra extensions of the super Poincaré group (from the brane scan/brane bouquet) yields type II supergravity, heterotic supergravity and 11-dimensional supergravity in higher Cartan geometry-formulation (D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity).

Local and global framing
Discussion in the physics literature traditionally tends to ignore the global structure of spacetime manifolds and pretends that a vielbein field may be chosen globally, hence that spacetime admits a framing.
In general that is only valid locally, but it so happens that in the archetypical case of interest, namely for 4-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetimes with orientable spatial slices, it is valid globally. See this remark at framed manifold for more.
See also at teleparallel gravity.
In physics, the term general covariance is meant to indicate the property of a physical system or model (in theoretical physics) whose configurations, action functional and equations of motion are all equivariant under the action of the diffeomorphism group on the smooth manifold underlying the spacetime or the worldvolume of the system. Here “covariance” is as in “covariant tensor” another term for behaviour under diffeomorphisms.
The term general relativity for Einstein-gravity originates in at least closely related ideas (see History and original formulation below), and Einstein-gravity is the archtypical example of a generally covariant physical system:
here, the configuration space of physical fields over a smooth manifold Σ\Sigma is not quite the space of Riemannian metrics on Σ\Sigma itself, but is the quotient [Σ,Fields]/Diff(Σ)[\Sigma,\mathbf{Fields}]/\mathbf{Diff}(\Sigma) of this space by the action of the diffeomorphism group Diff(Σ)\mathbf{Diff}(\Sigma): two Riemannian metrics g 1g_1 and g 2g_2 on Σ\Sigma represent the same field of gravity on Σ\Sigma if there is a diffeomorphism f:Σ→≃Σf : \Sigma \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \Sigma such that g 2=f *g 1g_2 = f^* g_1.
Or rather, such a diffeomorphism is a gauge transformation between the two field configurations. The configuration space is not the naive quotient of fields by diffeomorphisms as above, but is the homotopy quotient, or action groupoid, denoted [Σ,Fields]⫽Diff(Σ)[\Sigma,\mathbf{Fields}]\sslash \mathbf{Diff}(\Sigma). In the physics literature this action groupoid is most familiar in its infinitesimal approximation, the corresponding Lie algebroid, whose formal dual is a BRST complex whose degree-1 elements are accordingly called the diffeomorphism ghosts (see there).
As with all gauge transformations, they relate physical configurations which may be nominally different, but equivalent. Therefore general covariance is an instance of the general principle of equivalence in mathematics which says that sensible statements about objects must respect the isomorphisms and more general equivalences between these objects.
A physical system which is not generally covariant in this sense is hence one where the smooth manifold Σ\Sigma as above, underlying spacetime/worldvolume is not regarded as modelling an absolute physical system (such as the observable universe in gravity), but a subsystem that is equipped with ambient structure that breaks the diffeomorphism symmetry. Notably systems like electromagnetism or Yang-Mills theory have traditionally been written in a non-generally covariant form describing gauge fields on a fixed gravitational background, as for instance the space inhabited by a particle accelerator. This ambient structure on the spacetime Σ\Sigma breaks its general diffeomorphism invariance and hence the effective resulting theory on this background is not generally covariant (a special case of the general phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking).
On the other hand, such a model consisting of background (e.g. the particle accelerator) and quantum fields propagating in it is ultimately to be understood as an approximation to a more encompassing model in which also the background is dynamical, and which is again generally covariant. Specific for electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theory this refined generally covariant model is known as Einstein-Maxwell theory or more generally Einstein-Yang-Mills theory.
The idea of general covariance has a long and convoluted history and the literature witnesses plenty of disagreement about how to interpret and formalize it in technical detail (Norton). Already early arguments by Einstein himself (e.g. the “hole paradox” (Einstein-Grossmann)) show that the discussion has suffered from the beginning from lack of the basic category theoretic concept of isomorphism in the category Diff of smooth manifolds. Below in Formalization in homotopy type theory we indicate a formalization of general covariance that is general, fundamental, and accurately reflects the role of the term in theoretical physics.

A quantum field theory of supergravity is similar to the theory of gravity, but where (in first order formulation) the latter is given by an action functional (the Einstein-Hilbert action functional) on the space of connections (over spacetime) with values in the Poincare Lie algebra 𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{iso}(n,1), supergravity is defined by an extension of this to an action functional on the space of connections with values in the super Poincare Lie algebra 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{siso}(n,1). One says that supergravity is the theory of local (Poincaré) supersymmetry in the same sense that ordinary gravity is the theory of “local Poincaré-symmetry”. These are gauge theories for the Poincare Lie algebra and the super Poincare Lie algebra, respectively, in that the field (physics) is a Cartan connection for the inclusion o(n,1)↪𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)o(n,1) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{siso}(n,1):
if we write 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{siso}(n,1) as a semidirect product of the translation Lie algebra ℝ (n,1)\mathbb{R}^{(n,1)}, the special orthogonal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{so}(n,1) and a spin group representation Γ\Gamma, then locally a connection is a Lie algebra valued 1-form
A:TX→𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(n,1)
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(n,1)


that decomposes into three components, A=(E,Ω,Ψ)A = (E, \Omega, \Psi):


a ℝ n,1\mathbb{R}^{n,1}-valued 1-form EE – the vielbein
(this encodes the pseudo-Riemannian metric and hence the field of gravity);


a 𝔰𝔬(n,1)\mathfrak{so}(n,1)-valued 1-form Ω\Omega – called the spin connection;


a Γ\Gamma-valued 1-form Ψ\Psi – called the gravitino field.


Typically in fact the field content of supergravity is larger, in that a field AA is really an ∞-Lie algebra-valued differential form with values in an ∞-Lie algebra such as the supergravity Lie 3-algebra (DAuriaFreCastellani) 𝔰𝔲𝔤𝔯𝔞(10,1)\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1). Specifically such a field
A:TX→𝔰𝔲𝔤𝔯𝔞(10,1)
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{sugra}(10,1)


has one more component

a 3-form CC – the supergravity C-field.

The gauge transformations on the space of such connections that are parameterized by the elements of Γ\Gamma are called supersymmetries.

The condition of gauge invariance of an action functional on 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬\mathfrak{siso}-connections is considerably more restrictive than for one on 𝔦𝔰𝔬\mathfrak{iso}-connections. For instance there is, under mild assumptions, a unique maximally supersymmetric supergravity extension of the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert action on a 4-dimensional manifold. This in turn is obtained from the unique (under mild assumptions) maximally supersymmetric supergravity action functional on a (10,1)-dimensional spacetime by thinking of the 4-dimensional action function as being a dimensional reduction of the 11-dimensional one.
This uniqueness (under mild conditions) is one reason for interest in supergravity theories. Another important reason is that supergravity theories tend to remove some of the problems that are encountered when trying to realize gravity as a quantum field theory. Originally there had been high hopes that the maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 4-dimensions is fully renormalizable. This couldn’t be shown computationally – until recently: triggered by new insights recently there there has been lots of renewed activity on the renormalizability of maximal supergravity.
As a gauge theory – Super Cartan geometry
Ordinary Einstein gravity has a natural formulation in terms of Cartan geometry for the inclusion of the Lorentz Lie algebra into the Poincaré Lie algebra 𝔬(d−1,1)↪ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1) \hookrightarrow \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}). In this first order formulation of gravity a field configuration is a Cartan connection with such coefficients.
This perspective directly generalizes to supergeometry and yields the superspace formulation of theories of supegravity – super Cartan geometry.
After picking a dimension d∈ℕd\in \mathbb{N} and writing ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}) for the Poincaré Lie algebra, then a choice of “number of supersymmetries” is a choice of real spin representation NN. Then the direct sum
ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1|N)≔ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)⏟ even⊕N⏟ odd
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})
  \coloneqq
  \underbrace{\mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})}_{even} \oplus \underbrace{N}_{odd}


regarded as a super vector space with NN in odd degree becomes a super Lie algebra by letting the [even,odd][even,odd] bracket be given by the defining action and by letting the [odd,odd][odd,odd] bracket be given by a canonically induced bilinear and 𝔬\mathfrak{o}-equivariant pairing – the super Poincaré Lie algebra. This still canonical contains the Lorentz Lie algebra 𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}) and the quotient
ℝ d−1,1|N≔ℑ𝔰𝔬(ℝ d−1,1|N)/𝔬(ℝ d−1,1)
  \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N} 
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{Iso}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1|N})/\mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1})


is called super Minkowski spacetime (equipped with its super translation Lie algebra structure).
From this, a super-Cartan geometry is defined in direct analogy to the Cartan formulation of Riemannian geometry

Indeed, all the traditional literature on supergravity (e.g. (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91)) is phrased, more or less explicitly, in terms of Cartan connections for the inclusion of the Lorentz group into the super Poincaré group this way, this being the formalization of what physicists mean when saying that they pass to “local supersymmetry”.
One subtlety to take care of is that this makes spacetime a super-spacetime locally modeled on super Minkowski spacetime. But the resulting theory is supposed to be a field theory on an ordinary spacetime locally modeled on ordinary Minkowski spacetime. This is enforced by a further constraint on the super-Cartan connection which forces it to be determined by the bosonic manifold underlying the given supermanifold. This constraint is variously known as the superspace constraints or as rheonomy .
The other subtlety to take care of is that a key aspect of higher dimensional supergravity theories is that their field content necessarily includes, in addition to the graviton and the gravitino, higher differential n-form fields, notably the 2-form B-field of 10-dimensional type II supergravity and heterotic supergravity as well as the 3-form C-field of 11-dimensional supergravity.
This means that these higher dimensional supergravity theories are not in fact entirely described by super-Cartan geometry – but by super-higher Cartan geometry.
This follows a key insight due to (D’Auria-Fré-Regge 80, D’Auria-Fré 82) – the D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity – that the “tensor multiplet” fields of higher dimensional supergravity theories as above are naturally brought into the previous perspective if only one allows more general Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras.
Namely, we may add to the above CE-algebra

a single generator c 3c_3 of degree (3,even)(3,even)

and extend the differential to that by the formula
d CEc 3=12ψ¯Γ ab∧ψ∧e a∧e b.
  d_{CE} \, c_3 = \frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b
  \,.


This still squares to zero due to the remarkable property of 11d super Minkowski spacetime by which 12ψ¯Γ ab∧ψ∧e a∧e b∈CE 4(ℑ𝔰𝔬(10,1|N=1))\frac{1}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \psi \wedge e_a \wedge e_b \in CE^4(\mathfrak{Iso}(10,1|N=1)) is a representative of an exception super-Lie algebra cohomology class. (The collection of all these exceptional classes constitutes what is known as the brane scan).
In the textbook (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91) a beautiful algorithm for constructing and handling higher supergravity theories based on such generalized CE-algebras is presented, but it seems fair to say that the authors struggle a bit with the right mathematical perspective to describe what is really happening here.
But from a modern perspective this becomes crystal clear: these generalized CE algebras are CE-algebras not of Lie algebras but of strong homotopy Lie algebras, hence of L-infinity algebras, in fact of Lie (p+1)-algebras for (p+1)(p+1) the degree of the relevant differential form field.
Specifically, me may write the above generalized CE-algebra with the extra degree-3 generator c 3c_3 as the CE-algebra CE(𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢)CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) 
of the supergravity Lie 3-algebra 𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}.
Now a morphism
Ω •(U)⟵CE(𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢):A
  \Omega^\bullet(U) \stackrel{}{\longleftarrow} CE(\mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane}) \;\colon\; A


encodes graviton and gravitino fields as above, but in addition it encodes a 3-form
C 3≔A(c 3)∈Ω (3,even)(U)
  C_3 \coloneqq A(c_3) \in \Omega^{(3,even)}(U)


whose curvature
G 4=dC 3+12Ψ¯Γ ab∧Ψ∧E a∧E b
  G_4 = \mathbf{d}C_3 + \frac{1}{2}\bar \Psi \Gamma^{a b} \wedge \Psi \wedge E_a \wedge E_b


satisfies a modified Bianchi identity, crucial for the theory of 11-dimensional supergravity (D’Auria-Fré 82).
So this collection of differential form data is no longer a Lie algebra valued differential form, it is an L-infinity algebra valued differential form, with values in the supergravity Lie 3-algebra.
The quotient
ℝ^ 10,1|N=1≔𝔤/𝔥=𝔪2𝔟𝔯𝔞𝔫𝔢/𝔬(ℝ 10,1|N=1)
  \widehat{\mathbb{R}}^{10,1|N=1}
  \coloneqq
  \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}
  =
  \mathfrak{m}2\mathfrak{brane} / \mathfrak{o}(\mathbb{R}^{10,1|N=1})


is known as extended super Minkowski spacetime.
The Lie integration of this is a smooth 3-group GG which receives a map from the Lorentz group.
This means that a global description of the geometry which (Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91) discuss locally on charts has to be a higher kind of Cartan geometry which is locally modeled not just on cosets, but on the homotopy quotients of (smooth, supergeometric, …) infinity-groups – higher Cartan geometry.
Solutions with global supersymmetry
A solution to the bosonic Einstein equations of ordinary gravity – some Riemannian manifold – has a global symmetry if it has a Killing vector.
Accordingly, a configuration that solves the supergravity Euler-Lagrange equations is a global supersymmetry if it has a Killing spinor: a covariantly constant spinor.
Here the notion of covariant derivative includes the usual Levi-Civita connection, but also in general torsion components and contributions from other background gauge fields such as a Kalb-Ramond field and the RR-fields in type II supergravity or heterotic supergravity.
Of particular interest to phenomenologists around the turn of the millennium (but maybe less so today with new experimental evidence) has been in solutions of spacetime manifolds of the form M 4×Y 6M^4 \times Y^6 for M 4M^4 the locally observed Minkowski spacetime (that plays a role as the background for all available particle accelerator experiments) and a small closed 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold Y 6Y^6.
In the absence of further fields besides gravity, the condition that such a configuration has precisely one Killing spinor and hence precisely one global supersymmetry turns out to be precisely that Y 6Y^6 is a Calabi-Yau manifold. This is where all the interest into these manifolds in string theory comes from. (Notice though that nothing in the theory itself demands such a compactification. It is only the phenomenological assumption of the factorized spacetime compactification together with N=1N = 1 supersymmetry that does so.)
More generally, in the presence of other background gauge fields, the Calabi-Yau condition here is deformed. One also speaks of generalized Calabi-Yau spaces. (For instance (GMPT05)).

As a background for Green-Schwarz σ\sigma-models
The equations of motion of those theories of supergravity which qualify as target spaces for Green-Schwarz action functional sigma models (e.g. 10d heterotic supergravity for the heterotic string and 10d type II supergravity for the type II string) are supposed to be equivalent to those σ\sigma-models being well defined (the WZW-model term being well defined, hence κ\kappa-symmetry being in effect). See at Green-Schwarz action – References – Supergravity equations of motion for pointers.
Scalar moduli spaces and UU-duality
The compact exceptional Lie groups form a series
E 8,E 7,E 6
  E_8, E_7, E_6


which is usefully thought of to continue as
E 5:=Spin(10),E 4:=SU(5),E 3:=SU(3)×SU(2).
  E_5 := Spin(10), E_4 := SU(5), E_3 := SU(3) \times SU(2)
  \,.


Supergravity theories are controled by the corresponding split real forms
E 8(8),E 7(7),E 6(6)
  E_{8(8)}, E_{7(7)}, E_{6(6)}


E 5(5):=Spin(5,5),E 4(4):=SL(5,ℝ),E 3(3):=SL(3,ℝ)×SL(2,ℝ).
  E_{5(5)} := Spin(5,5), E_{4(4)} := SL(5, \mathbb{R}), 
  E_{3(3)} := SL(3, \mathbb{R}) \times SL(2, \mathbb{R})
  \,.


For instance the scalar fields in the field supermultiplet of 3≤d≤113 \leq d \leq 11-dimensional supergravity have moduli spaces parameterized by the homogeneous spaces
E n(n)/K n
  E_{n(n)}/ K_n


for
n=11−d,
  n = 11 - d
  \,,


where K nK_n is the maximal compact subgroup of E n(n)E_{n(n)}:
K 8≃Spin(16),K 7≃SU(8),K 6≃Sp(4)
  K_8 \simeq Spin(16), K_7 \simeq SU(8), K_6 \simeq Sp(4)


K 5≃Spin(5)×Spin(5),K 4≃Spin(5),K 3≃SU(2)×SO(2).
  K_5 \simeq Spin(5) \times Spin(5), 
  K_4 \simeq Spin(5),
  K_3 \simeq SU(2) \times SO(2)
  \,.


Therefore E n(n)E_{n(n)} acts as a global symmetry on the supergravity fields.
This is no longer quite true for their UV-completion by the corresponding compactifications of string theory (e.g. type II string theory for type II supergravity, etc.). Instead, on these a discrete subgroup
E n(n)(ℤ)↪E n(n)
  E_{n(n)}(\mathbb{Z}) \hookrightarrow E_{n(n)}


acts as global symmetry. This is called the U-duality group of the supergravity theory (see there for more).
It has been argued that this pattern should continue in some way further to the remaining values 0≤d<30 \leq d \lt 3, with “Kac-Moody groups” corresponding to the Kac-Moody algebras
𝔢 9,𝔢 10,𝔢 11.
  \mathfrak{e}_9, \mathfrak{e}_10, \mathfrak{e}_{11}
  \,.


Continuing in the other direction to d=10d = 10 (n=1n = 1) connects to the T-duality group O(d,d,ℤ)O(d,d,\mathbb{Z}) of type II string theory.

weak gravity conjecture


The D’Auria-Fré formalism (D’Auria-Fré-Regge 80, D’Auria-Fré 80, Castellani-D’Auria-Fré 91) is a natural “superspace” formulation of supergravity in general dimensions, including type II supergravity and heterotic supergravity in dimension 10 as well as notably 11-dimensional supergravity.
This proceeds in generalization of how Einstein gravity in first order formulation of gravity is equivalently the Cartan geometry for the inclusion of the Lorentz group inside the Poincare group: a field configuration of the field of gravity is equivalently a Cartan connection for this subgroup inclusion.
Accordingly, low dimensional supergravity without extended supersymmetry is equivalently the super-Cartan geometry of the inclusion of the spin group into the super Poincaré group.
What D’Auria-Fré implicitly observe (not in this homotopy theoretic language though, that was developed in Sati-Schreiber-Stasheff 08, Fiorenza-Schreiber-Stasheff 10, Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13) is that for higher supergravity with extended supersymmetry such as 11-dimensional supergravity with its M-theory super Lie algebra symmetry, the description of the fields is in the higher differential geometry version of Cartan geometry, namely higher Cartan geometry, where the super Poincare Lie algebra is replaced by one of its exceptional super Lie n-algebra extensions (those that also control the brane scan), such as notably the supergravity Lie 3-algebra and the supergravity Lie 6-algebra. This is the refinement of super-Cartan geometry to higher Cartan geometry.
This higher super Cartan geometry-description of supergravity is what D’Auria-Fré called the geometric approach to supergravity or geometric supergravity (e.g. D’Auria 20).

History
Around 1981 D’Auria and Fré noticed, in GeSuGra, that the intricacies of various supergravity classical field theories have a strikingly powerful reformulation in terms of super semifree differential graded-commutative algebras.
They defined various such super dg-algebras W(𝔤)W(\mathfrak{g}) and showed (paraphrasing somewhat) that


the field content, field strengths, covariant derivatives and Bianchi identities are all neatly encoded in terms of dg-algebra homomorphism Ω •(X)←W(𝔤):ϕ\Omega^\bullet(X) \leftarrow W(\mathfrak{g}) : \phi;


the action functionals of supergravity theories on such ϕ\phi may be constructed as images under ϕ\phi of certain elements in W(𝔤)W(\mathfrak{g}) subject to natural conditions.


Their algorithm was considerably more powerful than earlier more pedestrian methods for construction such action functionals. The textbook CastellaniDAuriaFre on supergravity and string theory from the perspective of this formalism gives a comprehensive description of this approach.
We observe here that the D’Auria-Fre-formalism is ∞-Chern-Simons theory for ∞-Lie algebra-valued forms with values in super ∞-Lie algebras such as the supergravity Lie 3-algebra and the supergravity Lie 6-algebra.
The pivotal concept that allows to pass between this interpretation and the original formulation is the concept of ∞-Lie algebroid with its various incarnations:

Remark
(Incarnations of ∞\infty-Lie algebroids)
A (super) ∞-Lie algebroid


is an infinitesimal (super)∞-Lie groupoid


that may be modeled as a simplicial (super) infinitesimal space


whose function algebra is a cosimplicial (super) algebra


that under the monoidal Dold-Kan correspondence maps to a (super) semifree differential graded-commutative algebra: the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the (super) ∞-Lie algebroid.



Notably the semifree dga upon which D’Auria-Fré base their description is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the supergravity Lie 3-algebra, which is an ∞-Lie algebra that is a higher central extension

of a super Poincare Lie algebra 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(10,1)\mathfrak{siso}(10,1) in the way the String Lie 2-algebra 𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔦𝔫𝔤(n)\mathfrak{string}(n) is a higher central extension of the special orthogonal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(n)\mathfrak{so}(n).
A super connection on an ∞-bundle with values in 𝔰𝔲𝔤𝔯𝔞(10,1)\mathfrak{sugra}(10,1) on a supermanifold XX is locally given by ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms consisting of


a ℝ 11\mathbb{R}^{11}-valued 1-form ee – the vielbein


a 𝔰𝔬(10,1)\mathfrak{so}(10,1)-valued 1-form ω\omega – the spin connection


a spin-representation valued 1-form ψ\psi – the spinor


a 3-form CC .


These are identified with the fields of 11-dimensional supergravity, respectively:


the graviton (e,ω)(e, \omega)


the gravitino ψ\psi


the supergravity C-field CC .


By realizing this data as components of a Lie 3-algebra valued connection (more or less explicitly), the D’Auria-Fré-formalism achieves some conceptual simplication of


the construction of supersymmetric supergravity action functionals;


the determination of the corresponding classical equations of motion.

Originally D’Auria and Fré referred to commutative semifree dgas as Cartan integrable systems. Later the term free differential algebra, abbreviated FDA was used instead and became popular. Nowadays much of the literature that studies commutative semifree dgas in supergravity refers to them as “FDA”s. One speaks of the FDA approach to supergravity .
But strictly speaking “free differential algebra” is a misnomer: genuinely free differential algebras are pretty boring objects. Crucially it is only the underlying graded commutative algebra which is required to be free as a graded commutative algebra in that it is a Grassmann algebra ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* on a graded vector space 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*. The differential on that is in general not free, hence the more precise term semifree dga .
In fact, when 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is concentrated in non-positive degree (so that ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* is concentrated in non-negative degree) the differential on ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^{*} encodes all the structure of an ∞-Lie algebroid on 𝔤\mathfrak{g}. If 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is concentrated in negative degree the differential encodes the structure of an ∞-Lie algebra on 𝔤\mathfrak{g}. This interpretation of semifree dgas in Lie theory is the key to our general abstract reformulation of the D’Auria-Fré-formalism.
Already D’Auria and Fré themselves, and afterwards other authors, have tried to better understand the intrinsic conceptual meaning of their dg-algebra formalism that happened to be so useful in supergravity:
The idea arose and then became popular in the “FDA”-literature that the D’Auria-Fré-formalism should be about a concept called soft group manifolds. This is motivated by the observation that by means of the dg-algebra formulation the fields in supergravity arrange themselves into systems of differential forms that satisfy equations structurally similar to the Maurer-Cartan forms of left-invariant differential forms on a Lie group – except that where the ordinary Maurer-Cartan form has vanishing curvature (= field strength) these equations for supergravity fields have a possibly non-vanishing field strength. It is proposed in the “FDA”-literature that these generalized Maurer-Cartan equations describe generalized or “softened” group manifolds.
However, even when the field strengths do vanish, the remaining collection of differential forms does not constrain the base manifold to be a group. Rather, if the field strengths vanish we have a natural interpretation of the remaining differential form data as being flat ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms, given by a morphism
A:TX→𝔤
  A : T X \to \mathfrak{g}


from the tangent Lie algebroid of the base manifold XX to the ∞-Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} encoded by the semifree dga in question. In fact, applying the functor from ∞-Lie algebroids to dg-algebras given by forming Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras, the above morphism turns into a dg-algebra morphism
Ω •(X)←CE(𝔤):A
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  A


to the deRham dg-algebra of XX (which we denote by the same letter, AA, in a convenient abuse of notation).
Since CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) is semifree, this is a map of graded vector spaces
Ω •(X)←𝔤 *:A
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  \mathfrak{g}^*
  :
  A


together with a constraint that the morphism respects the differentials on CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) and on Ω •(X)\Omega^\bullet(X). Such a morphism of graded vector spaces in canonically identified with a 𝔤\mathfrak{g}-valued differential form (recall that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is a graded vector space)
ω∈Ω •(X,𝔤) 
  \omega \in \Omega^\bullet(X,\mathfrak{g})


and the aforementioned constraint is precisely the Maurer-Cartan-like equation that is known from left-invariant 1-forms on a Lie group. In fact, for GG a Lie group with Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} there is a canonical morphism
Ω •(G)←CE(𝔤)
  \Omega^\bullet(G)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})


whose image is precisely the left-invariant 1-forms on the Lie group GG and whose respect for the differentials is precisely the ordinary Maurer-Cartan equation.
To see the role of group manifolds for more general morphisms
Ω •(X)←CE(𝔤):A
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  CE(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  A


one has to apply Lie integration of the ∞-Lie algebroid morphism TX→𝔤T X \to \mathfrak{g} to a morphism of ∞-Lie groupoids
Π(X)→BG
  \Pi(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


where Π(X)\Pi(X) is the path ∞-groupoid and where BG\mathbf{B}G is the delooping of Lie in-group GG that integrates the Lie n-algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}. Such morphisms are the integrated version of flat ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms.
The ∞-Chern-Weil theory of connections on ∞-bundles is about


the generalization of such flat form data to ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential forms with curvature.


the generalization from globally defined differential form data – which are connections on trivial principal ∞-bundles – to connections on arbitrary principal ∞-bundles.


The D’Auria-Fré-formalism – after this re-interpretation – is about the first of these points. So as an immediate gain of our reformulation of D’Auria-Fré-formalism in terms of connections on ∞-bundles we obtain, using the second of these points, a natural proposal for a formulation of supergravity field configurations that are possibly globally topologically nontrivial. Physicists speak of instanton solutions.
In fact, the ∞-Lie theory-reformulation exhibits the D’Auria-Fré-formalism as being secretly the realization of supergravity as a higher gauge theory.
It realizes supergravity as an example for a nonabelian higher gauge theory in that a supergravity field configuration is not realizable as a cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology as in ordinary abelian higher gauge theory (see there) but as a nonabelian connection on an ∞-bundle.

level (Chern-Simons theory)

A σ\sigma-model is a particular kind of physical theory of certain fields. The basic data describing a specific σ\sigma-model is some kind of “space” XX, in a category of “spaces” which includes smooth manifolds. We call XX the target space, and we define the “configuration space of fields” Conf ΣConf_\Sigma over a manifold Σ\Sigma to be the mapping space/mapping stack Map(Σ,X)Map(\Sigma, X). That is, a “configuration of fields” over a manifold Σ\Sigma is like an XX-valued function on Σ\Sigma.
We assign a dimension n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} to our σ\sigma-model, take dimΣ≤ndim \Sigma \leq n and assume that target space XX is equipped with a “circle n-bundle with connection”.
For n=1n = 1 this is an ordinary circle bundle with connection and models a configuration of the electromagnetic field on XX. To distinguish this “field” on XX from the fields on Σ\Sigma we speak of a background gauge field. (This remains fixed background data unless and until we pass to second quantization.) A field configuration Σ→X\Sigma \to X on Σ\Sigma models a trajectory of a charged particle subject to the forces exerted by this background field.
For n=2n = 2, a circle nn-bundle with connection is a circle 2-group principal 2-bundle or equivalently a bundle gerbe with connection. This models a “higher electromagnetic field”, called a Kalb-Ramond field. Now Σ\Sigma is taken to be 2-dimensional and a map Σ→X\Sigma \to X models the trajectory of a string on XX, subject to forces exerted on it by this higher order field.
This pattern continues. In the next dimension a membrane with 3-dimensional worldvolume is charged under a circle 3-bundle with connection, for instance something called the supergravity C-field.
While one can speak of higher bundles in full generality and full analogy to ordinary principal bundles, it is useful to observe that any circle nn-bundle is characterized by a classifying map α:X→B nU(1)\alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) in our category of spaces, so we can just think about classifying maps instead. Here U(1)U(1) is the circle group, and B n\mathbf{B}^n denotes its nnth delooping ; thus such a map is also a sort of cocycle in “smooth nnth cohomology of XX with coefficients in U(1)U(1)”. The additional data of a connection refines this to a cocycle in the differential cohomology of XX.
Such connection data ∇\nabla on a circle nn-bundle defines – and is defined by – a notion of higher parallel transport over nn-dimensional trajectories: for closed nn-dimensional Σ\Sigma it defines a map hol:(γ:Σ→X)↦exp(i∫ Σγ *∇)∈U(1)hol : (\gamma : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^*\nabla) \in U(1) that sends trajectories to elements in U(1)U(1): the holonomy of ∇\nabla over Σ\Sigma, given by integration of local data over Σ\Sigma. The local data being integrated is called the Lagrangian of the σ\sigma-model. Its integral is called the action functional.
In the quantum σ\sigma-model one considers in turn the integral of the action functional over all of configuration space: the “path integral”. In the classical σ\sigma-model one considers only the critical locus of the action functional (where the rough idea is that the path integral to some approximation localizes around the critical locus). Points in this critical locus are said to be configurations that satisfy the “Euler-Lagrange equations of motion”. These are supposed to be the physically realized trajectories among all of them, in the classical approximation.
Finally, just like an ordinary circle group-principal bundle has an associated vector bundle once we fix a representation of U(1)U(1) to be the fibers, any “circle n-bundle” has an associated “n-vector bundle” once we fix a “∞-representation” ρ:B nU(1)→nVect\rho : \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to n Vect on “n-vector spaces”. Just as for the ordinary U(1)U(1), here we usually pick the canonical 1-dimensional such “representation”. Finally, we define bundles V Σ:Conf Σ→𝒞V_\Sigma : Conf_\Sigma \to \mathcal{C} of “internal states” by transgression of these associated bundles.
The passage from principal ∞-bundles to associated ∞-bundles is necessary for the description of the quantum σ\sigma-model: it assigns in positive codimension spaces of sections of these associated bundles. For a 1-categorical description of the resulting QFT ordinary vector bundles (assigned in codimension 1) would suffice, but the σ\sigma-model should determine much more: an extended quantum field theory. This requires sections of higher vector bundles. For instance for n=2n = 2 some boundary conditions of the σ\sigma-model are given by sections of the background 2-vector bundle: these are the twisted vector bundles known as the Chan-Paton bundles on the boundary-D-branes of the string. (…)
We now try to fill this with life by spelling out some standard examples. Further below we look at precise formalizations of the situation.
The field of quantum field theory started out as a description of the fundamental particles that are observed in experiment, such as electrons and photons.
However, even so, abstractly the formalization of the concept of particle within QFTs is somewhat subtle.
If the quantum field theory is on Minkowski space and comes with a Hilbert space of states on which thus the Poincare group of translations, rotations and boosts in Minkowski space acts, the massive particle excitations of the theory can be found in the discrete spectrum of the time translation operator as the irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. For QFTs on curved spacetimes the situation is more subtle.
Often, however, QFTs are considered as quantizations of given Lagrangians. In these cases one often identifies their particle content with that explicitly encoded by the Lagrangian. Notably when that arises from second quantization of some 1-dimensional sigma-model, the particles of the theory are those described by these sigma-models.
The relativistic particle in physics is a model for the dynamics of a single particle that is propagating in a spacetime subject to forces such as gravity and (if it is charged) the electromagnetic field.
The generalization to supergeometry is the superparticle.
The relativistic particle is described by the sigma-model whose


target space is a spacetime (X,g)(X,g),
where the pseudo-Riemannian metric gg – or rather the Levi-Civita connection ∇\nabla that it induces on the tangent bundle TXT X – encodes the background field of gravity acting on the particle;


worldvolume is the real line Σ=ℝ\Sigma = \mathbb{R} or the circle Σ=S 1\Sigma = S^1, the worldline;


background gauge field is connection ∇\nabla on a circle group-principal bundle over XX, encoding a field of electromagnetism acting by Lorentz force on the particle;


configuration space is the quotient
Conf:=C ∞(Σ,X)//Diff(Σ)
  Conf := C^\infty(\Sigma, X)// Diff(\Sigma)


of the space (naturally a diffeological space) of smooth functions Σ→X\Sigma \to X (“trajectories”);


the exponentiated action functional is for given parameters m∈ℝm \in \mathbb{R} (the particle’s mass) and q∈ℝq \in \mathbb{R} (the particle’s charge)
exp(iS(−)):[γ]↦exp(im∫dvol(γ *g))hol(∇,γ),
  \exp(i S(-))
   : 
 [\gamma] 
     \mapsto
   \exp(
   i m \int dvol(\gamma^* g))
   \;\;
   hol(\nabla,\gamma)
   \,,


where the first terms is the integral of the volume form of the pullback of the background metric, and where the second term is the holonomy of the circle bundle with connection around γ\gamma. In the case that the underlying circle-principal bundle is trivial, so that the connection is given by a 1-form A∈Ω 1(X)A \in \Omega^1(X), the action functional is
S:[γ]↦ S kin([γ])+S gauge([γ])  =∫mdvol(γ *g)+∫qγ *A,
  \begin{aligned}
   S : 
   [\gamma]
    \mapsto
    & 
    S_{kin}([\gamma]) + S_{gauge}([\gamma])
    \\
    & =
    \int m dvol(\gamma^* g)
    +
    \int q \gamma^* A
  \end{aligned}
    \,,


where the first summand is the kinetic action and the second the gauge interaction term.


The above action functional is called the Nambu-Goto action in dimension 1. Alternatively (and mandatorily for vanishing mass parameter), the kinetic action is replaced by the corresponding Polyakov action.
Covariant phase space
We determine the covariant phase space of the theory: the space of solutions to the equations of motion and the presymplectic structure.
We assume for simplicity that the class of the background circle bundle is trivial, so that the connection is equivalently given by a 1-form A∈Ω 1(X)A \in \Omega^1(X). Write F=dAF = d A for its curvature 2-form: the field strength of the electromagnetic field.

Proposition
The variation of the gauge interaction term is
δ∫ Σγ *A=−∫ ΣF(γ˙,δγ).
  \delta \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
  =
  - \int_\Sigma F(\dot \gamma, \delta \gamma)
  \,.



Proof
Let ℝ d→≃U↪X\mathbb{R}^d \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} U \hookrightarrow X be a local coordinate patch with coordinates {x μ}\{x^\mu\} and assume that γ\gamma takes values in UU (or at least that its variation is supported there, which we can assume without restriction of generality). Then the variation is given by is
δ∫ Σγ *A =δ∫ ΣA μ(γ)γ˙ μdτ  =∫ Σ((∂ νA μ)(γ)γ˙ μ−ddτ(A ν(γ)))δγ νdτ  =∫ Σ((∂ νA μ)(γ)γ˙ μ−(∂ μA ν)(γ))γ˙ μ)δγ νdτ.
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta \int_\Sigma \gamma^* A
    & =
     \delta \int_\Sigma A_\mu(\gamma) \dot \gamma^\mu d \tau
    \\
    & = \int_\Sigma 
        \left(
           (\partial_{\nu} A_\mu)(\gamma) \dot \gamma^\mu
           -
           \frac{d}{d\tau} (A_\nu(\gamma))
        \right)
        \delta \gamma^\nu
        d \tau
    \\
    & = \int_\Sigma
        \left(
           (\partial_{\nu} A_\mu)(\gamma) \dot \gamma^\mu
           -
           (\partial_\mu A_\nu)(\gamma)) \dot \gamma^\mu
        \right)
        \delta \gamma^\nu  
        d\tau
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


The variation of the kinetic terms is slightly subtle due to the square root in
dvol(γ *g)=g(γ˙,γ˙)dτ.
  dvol(\gamma^* g) = \sqrt{g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)} d\tau
  \,.


To deal with this, we first look at variations of trajectories in a small region where g(γ˙,γ˙)g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma) is non-zero. For such we can always find a diffeomorphism Σ→≃Σ\Sigma \stackrel{\simeq }{\to} \Sigma such that this term is constantly =1= 1 in this region (recall that configurations are diffeomorphism classes of smooth curves, so we may apply such a diffeomorphism at will to compute the variation).

Proposition
With the above choice of diffeomorphism gauge, the equations of motion are
g(∇ γ˙γ˙/|γ˙|,−)=ι γ˙F,
  g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma / {\vert \dot \gamma}\vert ,-)  = \iota_{\dot \gamma} F
  \,,


where ∇\nabla is the covariant derivative with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the metric gg.


Proof
Computing as before in local coordinates and parameterization such that g(γ˙,γ˙)=1g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma) = 1, the variation of the kinetic terms is
δ∫ Σdvol(γ *g) =δ∫ Σg(γ˙,γ˙)dτ  =∫ Σ(12(∂ μg νλ)γ˙ νγ˙ λ−ddτ(g μνγ˙ ν))δγ μdτ  =∫ Σ(12(∂ μg νλ)γ˙ νγ˙ λ−2(g μνγ¨ ν+(∂ λg μν)γ˙ νγ˙ λ))δγ μdτ  =−∫ Σg μμ(γ¨ ν+Γ ν αβγ˙ αγ˙ β)δγ μ  =−∫ Σg μμ(∇ γ˙γ˙ ν)δγ μ  =−∫ Σg(∇ γ˙γ˙,δγ).
  \begin{aligned}   
    \delta \int_\Sigma dvol(\gamma^* g)
     & =
     \delta \int_\Sigma \sqrt{g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)} d\tau
     \\
     & = 
     \int_\Sigma 
      \left(
          \frac{1}{2}(\partial_\mu g_{\nu \lambda}) \dot \gamma^\nu \dot \gamma^\lambda 
          -
          \frac{d}{d\tau}(g_{\mu \nu} \dot \gamma^\nu) 
      \right)
      \delta \gamma^\mu

          -
          2 (g_{\mu\nu}\ddot \gamma^\nu + 
     (\partial_\lambda g_{\mu\nu}) \dot \gamma^\nu \dot \gamma^\lambda)
      \right)

    - \int_\Sigma
     g_{\mu \mu}(
      \ddot \gamma^\nu + \Gamma^\nu{}_{\alpha \beta} \dot \gamma^\alpha \dot \gamma^\beta
    )
   \delta \gamma^\mu
   \\
    & = 
    - \int_\Sigma

    )
   \delta \gamma^\mu
   \\
   & = -\int_\Sigma g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma, \delta \gamma)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


(Here Γ ⋅ ⋅⋅\Gamma^\cdot{}_{\cdot \cdot} are the Christoffel symbols.)
This gives the equations of motion as claimed.


Remark
The norm of the tangent vector along a physical trajectory is preserved:
ddτg(γ˙,γ˙) ∝2ddτg(∇ γ˙γ˙,γ˙)  ∝F(γ˙,γ˙)  0.
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{d \tau} \sqrt{g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)}
     & \propto
     2 \frac{d}{d \tau} g(\nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma, \dot \gamma) 
     \\
    & \propto 
     F(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma)
     \\
     & 0
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Therefore if the assumption g(γ˙,γ˙)≠0g(\dot \gamma, \dot \gamma) \neq 0 is satisfied at one instant, is is so everywhere along the curve.


Remark
For vanishing background gauge field strength, F=0F = 0, the equations of motion
∇ γ˙γ˙=0
  \nabla_{\dot \gamma} \dot \gamma = 0


express the parallel transport of the tangent vector along a physical trajectory. This identifies these trajectories with the geodesics of XX.

The spinning relativistic particle is a variant of the plain relativistic particle which has an “internal degree of freedom” called spin: it is a spinor , a fermion. Examples that appear in the standard model of particle physics are electrons, and quarks.
As a 1-dimensional sigma-model, the spinning relativistic particle is like the relativistic particle but with fermion fields on the worldline. This worldline action always happens to have worldline supersymmetry, entirely independent of whether there is any supersymmetry on target spacetime.
Worldline supersymmetry
We discuss how spinning particles automatically have supersymmetry in their worldline formalism. For more see the references below for more and see also at string theory FAQ – Does string theory predict supersymmetry?.
In the Polyakov action-formulation the action functional of the relativistic particle sigma model on the 1-dimensional worldline is actually 1-dimensional gravity coupled to “worldline matter fields”, where the latter are the embedding fields ϕ:ℝ→X\phi : \mathbb{R} \to X into the target space.
It turns out that the generalization of this 1-dimensional gravity action to supergravity yields the action functional that describes ordinary Dirac spinors – spinning particles like electrons – propagating on target space XX. See the references on worldline supersymmetry below.
The worldline supersymmetry of fermions comes down to the fact that their Hamiltonian(-constraint) operator HH has a square root: the Dirac operator DD. Its defining equations
[D,D]=2D 2=H,[H,H]=0,[D,H]=0
  [D,D] = 2 D^2 = H\,,\;\;\; [H,H] = 0\;,\;\; [D,H] = 0


characterize the d=1d = 1 translation super-Lie algebra.
For appreciating this fact it is important to keep the ingredients of sigma-model theory sorted out correctly: a supersymmetric theory on the worldline describes a spinning particle on some spacetime coupled to some background gauge fields. That background geometry need not have a “global supersymmetry” (a covariant constant spinor), hence under second quantization the perturbation theory on target space induced by the worldline theory need not have any global supersymmetries (in particular no superpartners to the effective particle excitations). What will happen, though, is that the full target space theory induced under second quantization will be a supergravity theory on target space. Some of its solutions may have covariantly constant spinors (and hence global supersymmetry), but generically they will not, just like the generic solution to ordinary Einstein equations does not have a Killing vector.

That some particles have a property called spin was found in 1922 in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
The superparticle is a sigma-model quantum field theory analogous to the ordinary relativistic particle but where either the worldline or the target space are taken to be supermanifolds. Described by supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
A string or 1-brane is a brane of dimension one higher than an ordinary particle:
where a 1-dimensional sigma-model may be thought of a describing the dynamics of particles propagating of a target space XX, a 2-dimensional sigma-model is said to described the dynamics of a string on some target space.
Much of traditional quantum field theory on XX may be understood in terms of second quantization of 1-dimensional sigma-models with target space XX. What is called string theory is the corresponding study of what happens to this situation as the 1-dimensional σ\sigma-model is replaced by a 2-dimensional one (for more on this see at worldline formalism).
A key motivation/application for strings is their identification with flux tubes in confined Yang-Mills theory/QCD [Polyakov (1998), Polyakov (1999)], for more on this see at AdS-CFT correspondence and AdS-QCD correspondence.
There is


the bosonic string of bosonic string theory


the superstring of superstring theory


(also called the F1-brane)

there is also the D1-brane.

The spinning string is a variant of the string in direct analogy (but one worldvolume dimension higher) to how the spinning particle is a variant of the particle.
(Which means that “spinning” here is not in the sense of “rotating”, but in the sense of the kind of “intrinsic” spin as exhibited by fermion particles. A spinning string can rotate in addition to its intrinsic spin.)
And just as as the spinning particle automatically exhibits local worldline supersymmetry, the spinning string automatically exhibits local worldsheet supersymmetry. For that reason it is today almost exclusively known as the superstring .
In fact, the very notion of supersymmetry was realized (in parallel to its independent discovery in Russia) when people noticed that the spinning string sigma-model – also called the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond model (NSR model) – automatically exhibits this extra graded symmetry.
When supplemented with an operation called the GSO projection, the second quantization of the spinning string – its effective target spacetime theory – also becomes a locally supersymmetric theory: spacetime supergravity.
There are other formulations of the superstring which are thought to be equivalent in some sense. Notably the Green-Schwarz superstring is a sigma-model which is not supersymmetric on the worldsheet but instead takes values in a genuine spacetime supermanifold.
The superstring 2-dimensional sigma-model is the analog of the string σ\sigma-model but with local worldsheet supersymmetry.
This is the higher dimensional analog of how the superparticle is related to the ordinary relativistic particle.
There are several different incarnations of the superstring.


the spinning string or NSR string has in fact local worldsheet supersymmetry
depending on how the GSO projection is chosen, this yields the type II superstring or type I superstring or type 0 superstring;


the Green-Schwarz superstring instead has manifest target space supersymmetry.


a mixture between the two has been proposed: the Berkovits superstring .

The next higher dimensional generalization of the concept of a relativistic particle and a relativistic string is called the relativistic membrane.
The concept of a bosonic membrane was considered already by Dirac 62 as a hypothetical model for the electron, then abandoned and eventually re-incarnated as the “super-membrane in 11d” due to Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87 (whose “m” became the “M” in “M-theory”), namely the Green-Schwarz sigma-model for super p-branes corresponding to the brane scan-entry with p=2p=2, D=11D=11, now commonly known as the M2-brane.
In fact, according to the brane scan, a super 2-brane sigma model exists on superspacetimes of dimension 4, 5, 7, and 11:

level (Chern-Simons theory)

What is called the AKSZ formalism – after the initials of its four authors – Alexandrov, Maxim Kontsevich, Albert Schwarz, Oleg Zaboronsky – is a technique for constructing action functionals in BV-BRST formalism for sigma model quantum field theories whose target space is an symplectic Lie n-algebroid (𝔓,ω)(\mathfrak{P}, \omega).
The action functional of AKSZ theory is that of ∞-Chern-Simons theory induced from the Chern-Simons element that correspondonds to the invariant polynomial ω\omega. Details on this are at ∞-Chern-Simons theory – Examples – AKSZ theory.
A sigma-model quantum field theory is, roughly, one


whose fields are maps ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X to some space XX;


whose action functional is, apart from a kinetic term, the transgression of some kind of cocycle on XX to the mapping space Map(Σ,X)\mathrm{Map}(\Sigma,X).


Here the terms “space”, “maps” and “cocycles” are to be made precise in a suitable context. One says that Σ\Sigma is the worldvolume, XX is the target space and the cocycle is the background gauge field .
For instance the ordinary charged particle (for instance an electron) is described by a σ\sigma-model where Σ=(0,t)⊂ℝ\Sigma = (0,t) \subset \mathbb{R} is the abstract worldline, where XX is a smooth (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold (for instance our spacetime) and where the background cocycle is a circle bundle with connection on XX (a degree-2 cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology of XX, representing a background electromagnetic field : up to a kinetic term the action functional is the holonomy of the connection over a given curve ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X.
The σ\sigma-models to be considered here are higher generalizations of this example, where the background gauge field is a cocycle of higher degree (a higher bundle with connection) and where the worldvolume is accordingly higher dimensional – and where XX is allowed to be not just a manifold but an approximation to a higher orbifold (a smooth ∞-groupoid).
More precisely, here we take the category of spaces to be smooth dg-manifolds. One may imagine that we can equip this with an internal hom Maps(Σ,X)\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X) given by ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded objects. Given dg-manifolds Σ\Sigma and XX their canonical degree-1 vector fields v Σv_\Sigma and v Xv_X acting on the mapping space from the left and right. In this sense their linear combination v Σ+kv Xv_\Sigma + k \, v_X for some k∈ℝk \in \mathbb{R} equips also Maps(Σ,X)\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X) with the structure of a differential graded smooth manifold.
Moreover, we take the “cocycle” on XX to be a graded symplectic structure ω\omega, and assume that there is a kind of Riemannian structure on Σ\Sigma that allows to form the transgression
∫ Σev *ω:=p !ev *ω
  \int_\Sigma \mathrm{ev}^* \omega
  :=
  p_! \mathrm{ev}^* \omega


by pull-push through the canonical correspondence
Maps(Σ,X)←pMaps(Σ,X)×Σ→evX,
  \mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X)
  \stackrel{p}{\leftarrow}
  \mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X) \times \Sigma
  \stackrel{ev}{\to}
   X
  \,,


where on the right we have the evaluation map.
Assuming that one succeeds in making precise sense of all this one expects to find that ∫ Σev *ω\int_\Sigma \mathrm{ev}^* \omega is in turn a symplectic structure on the mapping space. This implies that the vector field v Σ+kv Xv_\Sigma + k\, v_X on mapping space has a Hamiltonian S∈C ∞(Maps(Σ,X))\mathbf{S} \in C^\infty(\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X)). The grade-0 components S AKSZS_{\mathrm{AKSZ}} of S\mathbf{S} then constitute a functional on the space of maps of graded manifolds Σ→X\Sigma \to X. This is the AKSZ action functional defining the AKSZ σ\sigma-model with target space XX and background field/cocycle ω\omega.
In (AKSZ) this procedure is indicated only somewhat vaguely. The focus of attention there is a discussion, from this perspective, of the action functionals of the 2-dimensional σ\sigma-models called the A-model and the B-model .
In (Roytenberg), a more detailed discussion of the general construction is given, including an explicit
and general formula for S\mathbf{S} and hence for S AKSZS_{\mathrm{AKSZ}} . For {x a}\{x^a\} a coordinate chart on XX that formula is the following.

Definition
For (X,ω)(X,\omega) a symplectic dg-manifold of grade nn, Σ\Sigma a smooth compact manifold of dimension (n+1)(n+1) and k∈ℝk \in \mathbb{R}, the AKSZ action functional
S AKSZ,k:SmoothGrMfd(𝔗Σ,X)→ℝ
  S_{\mathrm{AKSZ},k} : 
   \mathrm{SmoothGrMfd}(\mathfrak{T}\Sigma, X)
  \to
  \mathbb{R}


(where 𝔗Σ\mathfrak{T}\Sigma is the shifted tangent bundle)
is
S AKSZ,k:ϕ↦∫ Σ(12ω abϕ a∧d dRϕ b+kϕ *π),
  S_{\mathrm{AKSZ},k} 
   :
  \phi
  \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma 
  \left(
    \frac{1}{2}\omega_{ab} \phi^a \wedge d_{\mathrm{dR}}\phi^b
    + 
    k
    \,
    \phi^* \pi
  \right)
  \,,


where π\pi is the Hamiltonian for v Xv_X with respect to ω\omega and where on the right we are interpreting fields as forms on Σ\Sigma.

This formula hence defines an infinite class of σ\sigma-models depending on the target space structure (X,ω)(X, \omega), and on the relative factor k∈ℝk \in \mathbb{R}. In (AKSZ) it was already noticed that ordinary Chern-Simons theory is a special case of this for ω\omega of grade 2, as is the Poisson sigma-model for ω\omega of grade 1 (and hence, as shown there, also the A-model and the B-model). The main example in (Roytenberg) is spelling out the general case for ω\omega of grade 2, which is called the Courant sigma-model there.
One nice aspect of this construction is that it follows immediately that the full Hamiltonian S\mathbf{S} on mapping space satisfies {S,S}=0\{\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{S}\} = 0. Moreover, using the standard formula for the internal hom of chain complexes one finds that the cohomology of (Maps(Σ,X),v Σ+kv X)(\mathrm{Maps}(\Sigma,X), v_\Sigma + k v_X) in degree 0 is the space of functions on those fields that satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations of S AKSZS_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}. Taken together this implies that S\mathbf{S} is a solution of the “master equation” of a BV-BRST complex for the quantum field theory defined by S AKSZS_{\mathrm{AKSZ}}. This is a crucial ingredient for the quantization of the model, and this is what the AKSZ construction is mostly used for in the literature.

String theory is a theory in fundamental physics. Certainly it is, mathematically, a structure that contains in various limits a plethora of quantum field theories. Its interest for experimental high energy physics lies in the hypothesis that it provides a theory of everything in the sense of fundamental physics, but the jury on that is still out.
Below we indicate the basic idea and provide pointers to further details. See also the string theory FAQ.
Conceptually: From QFT worldline formalism
Perturbative string theory is something at least close to a categorification of the following description of perturbative quantum field theory in terms of sums over Feynman diagrams.
Recall that in quantum field theory one approach to make sense of the path integral is the perturbation series expansion, which interprets the path integral for the scattering amplitudes (the S-matrix) as a certain sum over graphs of certain numbers assigned to each graph.
The graphs are called Feynman diagrams, the numbers assigned to them are called (renormalized) scattering amplitudes and the sum over graphs of (renormalized) amplitudes is the perturbation series or S-matrix.
The amplitude assigned to a single graph with nn external edges is interpreted as the amplitude for nn “quanta” or “particles” of the fields in question to interact in the way indicated by the graph.
Crucial for the motivation of the idea of string theory is the observation that this (renormalized) amplitude assigned to a graph is itself the correlator of a 1-dimensional quantum field theory on that graph: the “worldline quantum field theory” describing the (relativistic) quantum mechanics of these particles. This is usually a sigma-model with parameter space the given graph and target space the spacetime on which the fields live for which the perturbation series computes the path integral.
When made explicit this is called the worldline formalism for computing the quantum field perturbation series. (See there for more details.)
The premise of perturbative string theory is to replace the perturbation series over correlators of a 1-d QFT over graphs by a sum of correlators of a 2-dQFT over 2-dimensional surfaces – called worldsheets and hence produce an S-matrix this way. Again in simple cases this 2d QFT is a sigma-model whose target is the spacetime in which one computes interactions.


graphics grabbed from Jurke 10

In analogy to the previous case, one thinks of the amplitude assigned this way to a surface as the amplitude for the boundary arcs – the strings – to interact in the way given by the surface.
Some of the motivations for considering this replacement of graphs by surfaces have been the following:


the 2-d correlators are better behaved in that they don’t have to be renormalized. The “counterterms” appearing in renormalization of ordinary QFT can be identified with contributions to the correlators that come from the linear extension of the strings (see the above reference for more on this);


there are fewer choices involved: a Feynman graph is really a decorated graph with the decoration from some more or less arbitrary index set, describing the nature of the particles associated with a given edge and the nature of the interaction associated with a given vertex. In the sum over surfaces there is no extra decoration (except on the boundary of the surfaces) and one finds that instead a single string diagram (a 2d QFT correlator for a given surface) encodes already a sum over (infinitely) many particle species decorations and all possible interaction decorations for them;


while there are fewer choices to be made by hand, it turns out that the effective particle content that does arise automatically from this prescription happens to be structurally of the kind one would hope for: the massless effective particles described by the string perturbation series happen to be gauge bosons, fermions charged under them, and, notably, gravitons. This is structurally exactly the Yang-Mills theory input of the standard model of particle physics combined with perturbative quantum gravity that one would hope to see.


These aspects have motivated the impression that the string perturbation series might be considerably closer to the true formalism of fundamental physics than ordinary perturbative quantum field theory. This impression is however offset by the following problems:


while the worldsheet 2d QFT whose correlators are summed over surfaces are themselves much easier to handle than the full target space quantum physics they are used to encode, a fully complete and rigorous theory of 2d QFT is available only in simple special cases.


In particular, even though there are fewer arbitrary choices involved in the string perturbation series as compared to the ordinary Feynman perturbation series, one crucial choice still present is that of this worldsheet 2d QFT. By the above, every choice of worldsheet QFT (called a choice of “vacuum”) corresponds to a choice of effective target space geometry (to be thought of as the one that the perturbation series computes the quantum perturbations about) and particle content (see 2-spectral triple for more on that). One would therefore like to understand the space of all worldsheet QFTs whose effective target space geometry and particle content is close to the one experimentally observed. After many years of rather naïve approaches to handle or not to handle this, it has more recently at least come to the general attention that there is something to be better understood here.


More fundamentally, already the role of the original perturbation series in quantum field theory is actually not fully understood. Its main success is the observation that truncating or resumming the perturbation series in a more or less ad hoc way, it does yield values that very well describe a plethora of real world measurements. One imagines that there is a non-perturbative definition of quantum field theory such that in certain well-defined circumstances the perturbation series does yield an approximation to it and is a posteriori justified. If so, there should be an analogous nonperturbative definition of string theory. There is a large ratio of speculations as to what that might be over solid results about it.


Phenomenologically
While therefore the premise of perturbative string theory is conceptually suggestive for various reasons, there is to date no connection to experimental phenomenology (apart from the fact that conceptual insights into string theory have helped analyze quantum field theoretic data, see at string theory results applied elsewhere). As a result much of the substantial outcome of string theory research is more in mathematical physics (if done well, at least), exploring the general theory space of quantum field theories and their UV-completions, than in realistic model building (though there is no lack of trying), where it remains very speculative. This has led to public or semi-public debates about the value of string theory for actual physics. See at criticism of string theory for pointers.

Beyond the speculative hypothesized role of string theory as a physical theory of fundamental strings that constitute the observed fundamental particles in the standard model of particle physics, the theory has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory as such, both on the conceptual structure of QFT as well as on concrete theories and their concrete properties. This entry lists such instances of string theory results having led to insights in non-stringy physics and in particular into experimentally confirmed physics, such as QCD in the standard model of particle physics.

The construction of efficient computational methods for field theory scattering amplitudes has benefited substantially from string theory input.
Roiban & Volovich 2004

number theory and physics
There are several ways in which the Riemann hypothesis has or might have an incarnation in or leave an imprint on physics, specifically in quantum physics.
Via string theory
By the general discussion at zeta function and at functional determinant zeta functions are closely related to 1-loop vacuum amplitudes and to vacuum energy in quantum field theory in general and in string theory in particular.
Concretely, the Rankin-Selberg-Zagier method implies that the partition function of the superstring asymptotes for small proper time to a constant times a converging oscillatory term (reminiscent of the explicit formulae for L-functions) whose frequencies are proportional to the imaginary values of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function (ACER 11).
Similarly there the Veneziano amplitude of the string has an expression in terms of the Riemann zeta function (HJM 15).
Via noncommutative geometry
In other parts of the literature there is the desire to interpret the Riemann zeta function instead as a partition function of a quantum mechanical system. (Notice that the 1-loop vacuum amplitude mentioned before is instead a Mellin transform of the partition function.) The main example here is maybe the Bost-Connes system.

Der unendlich kleinste Theil des Raumes ist immer ein Raum, etwas, das Continuität hat, nicht aber ein blosser Punct, oder die Grenze zwischen bestimmten Stellen im Raume; (Fichte 1795, Grundriss, §4.IV)

In synthetic differential geometry one formulates differential geometry axiomatically in toposes – called smooth toposes – of generalized smooth spaces by assuming the explicit existence of infinitesimal neighbourhoods of points.
The main point of the axioms is to ensure that a well defined notion of infinitesimal spaces exists in the topos, whose existence concretely and usefully formalizes the wide-spread but often vague intuition about the role of infinitesimals in differential geometry.
In particular, in such toposes EE there exists an infinitesimal space DD that behaves like the infinitesimal interval in such a way that for any space X∈EX \in E the tangent bundle of XX, is, again as an object of the topos, just the internal hom TX:=X DT X \;\text{:=}\; X^D (using the notation of exponential objects in the cartesian closed category EE). So a tangent vector in this context is literally an infinitesimal path in XX.
This way, in smooth toposes it is possible to give precise well-defined meaning to many of the familiar computations – wide-spread in particular in the physics literature – that compute with supposedly “infinitesimal” quantities.

Remark
As quoted by Anders Kock in his first book (p. 9), Sophus Lie – one of the founding fathers of differential geometry and, of course Lie theory – once said that he found his main theorems in Lie theory using “synthetic reasoning”, but had to write them up in non-synthetic style (see analytic versus synthetic) just due to lack of a formalized language:

“The reason why I have postponed for so long these investigations, which are basic to my other work in this field, is essentially the following. I found these theories originally by synthetic considerations. But I soon realized that, as expedient ( zweckmässig ) the synthetic method is for discovery, as difficult it is to give a clear exposition on synthetic investigations, which deal with objects that till now have almost exclusively been considered analytically. After long vacillations, I have decided to use a half synthetic, half analytic form. I hope my work will serve to bring justification to the synthetic method besides the analytical one.” (Sophus Lie, Allgemeine Theorie der partiellen Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung, Math. Ann. 9 (1876).)


Synthetic differential geometry provides this formalized language.

Remark
Another advocate of the use of infinitesimals in the late 19th century was the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce:

The illumination of the subject by a strict notation for the logic of relatives had shown me clearly and evidently that the idea of an infinitesimal involves no contradiction…As a mathematician, I prefer the method of infinitesimals to that of limits, as far easier and less infested with snares. Charles Sanders Peirce, The Law of Mind, The Monist 2 (1892)

According to Bell (1998, p.5):

Peirce was aware, even before Brouwer, that a faithful account of the truly continuous will involve jettisoning the law of excluded(.)


Differentiation is the process that assigns to a function f:X→Yf : X \to Y its derivative, sometimes denoted dfd f. The derivative is a function that, roughly speaking, assigns to each point x∈Xx \in X the linear transformation df xd f_x that maps infinitesimal differences y−xy - x (for points yy infinitesimally close to xx) to infinitesimal differences f(y)−f(x)f(y) - f(x).
A function (map) is differentiable at some point if it can be well approximated by a linear map near that point. The approximating linear maps at different points together form the derivative of the map.
One may then ask whether the derivative itself is differentiable, and so on. This leads to a hierarchy of ever more differentiable maps, starting with continuous maps and progressing through maps that are nn times (continuously) differentiable to those that are infinitely differentiable, and finally to those that are analytic. Infinitely differentiable maps are sometimes called smooth.
Differentiability is first defined directly for maps between (open subsets of) a Cartesian space. These differentiable maps can then be used to define the notion of differentiable manifold, and then a more general notion of differentiable map between differentiable manifolds, forming a category called Diff. We have a parallel hierarchy of ever more differentiable manifolds and ever more differentiable maps between them. Since every more differentiable manifold has an underlying less differentiable manifold, we may always consider maps that are less differentiable than the manifolds between which they run.
An infinitesimal quantity is supposed to be a quantity that is infinitely small in size, yet not necessarily perfectly small (zero). An infinitesimal space is supposed to be a space whose extension is infinitely small, yet not necessarily perfectly small (pointlike).
Infinitesimal objects have been conceived and used in one way or other for a long time, notably in algebraic geometry, where Grothendieck emphasized the now familiar role of formal duals (affine schemes) of commutative rings RR with nilpotent ideals J⊂RJ\subset R as infinitesimal thickenings of the formal dual of the quotient ring R/JR/J.
See also infinitesimally thickened point.
Formalization in synthetic differential geometry
A proposal for formalizing the abstract nonsense behind the notion of the infinitesimal such that these algebraic constructions become models for more general axioms was given by William Lawvere in his 1967 lecture (see the references below).
Lawvere observed that a simple yet powerful characterization of the notion of infinitesimal space DD is that DD is an object in a topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} of spaces such that the inner hom functor (−) D:𝒯→𝒯(-)^D : \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T} has a right adjoint.
If the topos in question furthermore is equipped with a line object RR that plays the role of the real line ℝ\mathbb{R} then a sensible notion of infinitesimal quantities in RR is obtained when all morphisms D→RD \to R from infinitesimal spaces DD are necessarily linear maps. This is now known as the Kock-Lawvere axiom on lined toposes (𝒯,R)(\mathcal{T}, R). When it is satisfied, (𝒯,R)(\mathcal{T}, R) is called a smooth topos. The study of these is known as synthetic differential geometry.
The notion of infinitesimal object and infinitesimal space then makes sense in any smooth topos, and may be reasoned about generally for all smooth toposes. In any concrete model for the axioms there will accordingly be concrete realizations of these infinitesimal objects.
Realizations in algebraic geometry
Notably, for instance the Grothendieck topos of presheaves on the opposite category kCAlg opk CAlg^{op} of that of commutative kk-algebras (over some field kk) is a simple realization of a smooth topos (see for instance Kock-SGM, section 93). This topos and its variants and in particular their sheaf-localizations provide the context in which algebraic geometry takes place.
Therefore the notion of infinitesimals in algebraic geometry may be understood as being models of the general notion of infinitesimals in synthetic differential geometry in context such as 𝒯=Sh(kCAlg op)\mathcal{T} = Sh(k CAlg^{op}) or similar.
The vast majority of existing work on infinitesimals and infinitesimal neighbourhoods comes from algebraic geometry. It is the foundation of Grothendieck’s approach to regular differential operators, to costratifications, crystalline cohomology and de Rham descent.
Similar infinitesimal thickenings also appear in the noncommutative geometry of Kapranov, and in the language of abelian categories of quasicoherent sheaves in the work of Lunts and Rosenberg on regular differential operators in the content of noncommutative geometry, which strongly takes into account tensor products.
Comparison to infinitesimals in nonstandard analysis
Another notion of infinitesimals has arisen in the context of nonstandard analysis. The infinitesimal quantities considered there differ from the general ones in synthetic differential geometry in that they are all invertible (their inverses being “infinitely large”). Nevertheless, one can construct models of synthetic differential geometry which, in addition to nilpotent infinitesimals, contain invertible infinitesimals; see for instance MSIA, chapters VI and VII. Such invertible infinitesimals can be applied in some of the same ways as the infinitesimals of nonstandard analysis.
However, as pointed out in MSIA (intro. to Chapter VII), “there are some obvious differences.” The primary tool used in nonstandard analysis is a completely general transfer principle, saying that any statement in the ordinary world is also true in the nonstandard world. In particular, this implies that the infinitesimal and infinitely large quantities in nonstandard analysis obey all the same rules of arithmetic and analysis as do the standard ones. By contrast, a limited sort of transfer principle relating a pair of specific models for SDG is proven in MSIA, but it applies only to statements of a certain logical form. Moreover, the arithmetic of invertible infinitesimals in SDG has some unfamiliar aspects: for instance, mathematical induction is only valid for statements of a certain logical form, and the axiom of finite choice fails.
The construction of models for nonstandard analysis does, however, have a topos-theoretic description, using filterpower?s.
Atomic object

Definition (Lawvere)
In a cartesian closed category CC an object DD is called infinitesimal atomic if the hom-functor (−) D:C→C(-)^D : C \to C for maps out of DD (i.e. the functor of exponentiation by DD) is a left adjoint, i.e. if it has a right adjoint.

An object which is infinitesimal atomic is small from the internal perspective of the category. In contrast, an object is a tiny object when it is small from the external perspective, that is when the functor C(D,−):C→SetC(D,-):C\to Set into the category of sets preseves colimits.
When CC is a local Grothendieck topos over SetSet, then the two notions agree, but they do not in general. For example the terminal object 1\mathbf 1 in CC is always internally small (infinitesimal atomic), since the functor (−) 1(-)^{\mathbf 1} always has a right adjoint. But it is not necessarily a tiny object from the external perspective, since C(1,−)C(\mathbf 1,-) need not preserve colimits. This happens in situations where it is not appropriate to view the terminal object 1\mathbf 1 in a categoy as a small object from the external perspective, for example when we are in a slice topos C/SC/S. In such cases the correct intuitive external meaning of an object being internally small is that it is small in each fiber.

Remark
(intuitive interpretation)
Here is how to think of what this definition means intuitively. For that, notice how maps out of an ordinary space fail to preserve colimits:
for definiteness, consider the case of a cover of a space XX by spaces {U i→X} i\{U_i \to X\}_i so that XX is the coequalizer
(∐ i,jU i× XU j)→→(∐ iU i)→X
  (\coprod_{i,j} U_i \times_X U_j)
  \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  (\coprod_i U_i)
  \to X


as discussed in detail at sieve and sheaf. This says effectively that every point of XX is element of at least one of the covering spaces U iU_i and that one obtains XX by identifying the points in the covering spaces that correspond to the same one in XX.
Now let Σ\Sigma be any other space. We may assume here that the internal hom [Σ,−]:T→T[\Sigma,-] : T \to T at least preserves coproducts, so that applying this functor to the above diagram yields
(∐ i,j[Σ,U i× XU j])→→(∐ i[Σ,U i])→[Σ,X].
  (\coprod_{i,j} [\Sigma,U_i \times_X U_j])
  \stackrel{\to}{\to}
  (\coprod_i [\Sigma,U_i])
  \to [\Sigma,X]
  \,.


Now notice how this will in general fail to still be a coequalizer: if it were, for one the morphism (∐ i[Σ,U i])→[Σ,X]  (\coprod_i [\Sigma,U_i])
  \to [\Sigma,X] would have to be an epimorphism. But this can’t be in general, because it would mean that every map Σ→X\Sigma \to X factors through one of the covering spaces. The problem here is that in general the image of Σ→X\Sigma \to X may be larger than any of the U iU_i.
This is maybe most familiar in the context of loop spaces (for Σ\Sigma the circle): the loop space of a cover of XX is not in general a cover of the loop space.
But suppose that Σ\Sigma were infinitesimal. One thing that should mean is that there is no other space that is “effectively smaller” in some useful sense. For Σ\Sigma infinitesimal, we do expect that every map Σ→X\Sigma \to X can always be factored through at least one of the U iU_i: because Σ\Sigma is so small, the image of a map out of it can never be too large.
So only if Σ\Sigma qualifies as having infinitesimal extension can the functor [Σ,−][\Sigma,-] be expected to preserve colimits.

Formal infinitesimal space

Definition (formal infinitesimal space)
An object Δ\Delta in a smooth topos (𝒯,R)(\mathcal{T}, R) is called a formally infinitesimal object if it is the algebra-spectrum of (what in the sdg-literature is usually called) a -RR-Weil algebra in 𝒯\mathcal{T}
Δ≃Spec R(W).
  \Delta \simeq Spec_R(W)
  \,.


Here


W=R⊕JW = R \oplus J is an internal RR-algebra object in 𝒯\mathcal{T} with JJ an RR-finite dimensional nilpotent ideal


Spec R(W):=RAlg 𝒯(W,R)⊂R WSpec_R(W) := R Alg_{\mathcal{T}}(W,R) \subset R^W is the subobject of the internal hom of morphisms that respect the RR-algebra structure on WW and RR.


All the spaces that are described as collection of degree nn infinitesimal neighbours are of this form. Infinitesimal spaces not of this form are germ-spaces (see the examples below). These violate the finite-dimensionality assumption on JJ.
Abstractly
In differential cohesion an object/type DD is an infinitesimally thickened point if its corresponding reduced object is the terminal object,
ℜ(D)≃*,
  \Re(D) \simeq *
  \,,


hence it is an anti-reduced object.
In the standard type of model
An infinitesimally thickened point is – under Isbell duality – the formal dual of an RR-algebra of the form
A=R⊕W,
  A = R \oplus W
  \,,


where WW is a module of finite rank over RR and consisting of nilpotent elements in the algebra AA.

Remark
on terminology
In the literature on synthetic differential geometry an algebra AA of this form is also called a Weil algebra. Notice that this is unrelated to the notion of Weil algebra in Lie theory. For more on that, see Weil algebra.
Over more general base fields, this is called a local Artinian algebra.

William Lawvere‘s definition of an atomic infinitesimal space is as an object Δ\Delta in a topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} such that the inner hom functor (−) Δ:𝒯→𝒯(-)^\Delta : \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{T} has a right adjoint (is an atomic object).
Notice that by definition of inner hom, (−) Δ(-)^\Delta always has a left adjoint. A right adjoint can only exist for very particular objects. Therefore the term amazing right adjoint.
In the axiomatics of differential cohesion one may synthetically formulate a concept of manifolds locally modeled on a group object VV. In the interpretation in an differentially cohesive (infinity,1)-topos these are étale infinity-groupoids.
For exposition see at geometry of physics – manifolds and orbifolds and geometry of physics – supergeometry.
A differentiable manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space (a topological manifold) and such that the gluing functions which relate these Euclidean local charts to each other are differentiable functions, for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity then one speaks of smooth manifolds and if one demands analytic gluing functions then one speaks of analytic manifolds. For a general discussion see at manifold.
Accordingly, a differentiable manifold is a space to which the tools of (infinitesimal) analysis may be applied locally. Notably we may ask whether a continuous function between differentiable manifolds is differentiable by computing its derivatives pointwise in any of the Euclidean coordinate charts.
In particular one may consider smooth functions from the real line into any smooth manifold XX, “smooth curves” in XX. The equivalence classes of these that have the same first derivative at a given point capture the idea of “infinitsimal smooth paths” through that point in the manifold, called its tangent vectors. All the tangent vectors at one point x∈Xx \in X constitute the tangent space T xXT_x X, and the collection of all these tangent spaces yields another differentiable manifold, called the tangent bundle TXT X. This happens to be a vector bundle which is associated to a principal bundle, called the frame bundle Fr(X)Fr(X).
By equipping the tangent bundle or frame bundle of a differentiable manifold with extra properties or extra structure one encodes geometry on the manifold. For example equipping them with orthogonal structure encodes Riemannian geometry on manifolds. More generally one may consider any G-structure on the frame bundle and thereby equip the manifold with the corresponding Cartan geometry, for instance complex geometry, conformal geometry etc.
This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for differential geometry. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry. In fact both of these concepts are unified within synthetic differential geometry.
If one relaxes the condition on differentiable manifold from it being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to it just admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the more general concept of diffeological spaces or even smooth sets, see at generalized smooth space for more on this. If one generalizes here differentiable functions to simplicial differentiable functions one obtains concepts of derived smooth manifold.
The generalization of differentiable manifolds to higher differential geometry are orbifolds and more generally differentiable stacks. If one combines this with the generalization to smooth sets then one obtains the concept of smooth stacks and eventually smooth infinity-stacks.
For convenience, we first recall the basic definition of

Topological manifolds

and of

Differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces

and then turn to the actual definition of

Differentiable manifolds.

Topological manifolds
For convenience, we first recall here some background on topological manifolds:

Definition
(topological manifold)
A topological manifold is a topological space which is


locally Euclidean,


paracompact Hausdorff.


If the local Euclidean neighbourhoods ℝ n→≃U⊂X\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} U \subset X are all of dimension nn for a fixed n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, then the topological manifold is said to be a nn-dimensional manifold or nn-fold. This is usually assumed to be the case.


Remark
(varying terminology)
Often a topological manifold (def. ) is required to be sigma-compact. But by this prop. this is not an extra condition as long as there is a countable set of connected components. Moreover, manifolds with uncountably many connected components are rarely considered in practice.


Definition
(local chart, atlas and gluing function)
Given an nn-dimensional topological manifold XX (def. ), then





an open subset U⊂XU \subset X and a homeomorphism ϕ:ℝ n→A≃AU\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U is also called a local coordinate chart of XX.


an open cover of XX by local charts {ℝ n→ϕ iU⊂X} i∈I\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I} is called an atlas of the topological manifold.


denoting for each i,j∈Ii,j \in I the intersection of the iith chart with the jjth chart in such an atlas by
U ij≔U i∩U j
  U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j


then the induced homeomorphism
ℝ n⊃AAϕ i −1(U ij)⟶Aϕ iAU ij⟶Aϕ j −1Aϕ j −1(U ij)AA⊂ℝ n
  \mathbb{R}^n
    \supset
     \phantom{AA}
  \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  U_{i j}
    \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \phantom{AA}
    \subset
  \mathbb{R}^n


is called the gluing function from chart ii to chart jj.

Differentiable functions between Cartesian spaces
For convenience we recall the definition of differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces.

Definition
(differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces)
Let n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and let U⊂ℝ nU \subset \mathbb{R}^n be an open subset.
Then a function f:U⟶ℝf \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} is called differentiable at x∈Ux\in U if there exists a linear map df x:ℝ n→ℝd f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} such that the following limit exists as hh approaches zero “from all directions at once”:
lim h→0f(x+h)−f(x)−df x(h)‖h‖=0.
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} = 0.


This means that for all ϵ∈(0,∞)\epsilon \in (0,\infty) there exists an open subset V⊆UV\subseteq U containing xx such that whenever x+h∈Vx+h\in V we have f(x+h)−f(x)−df x(h)‖h‖<ϵ\frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} \lt \epsilon.
We say that ff is differentiable on a subset II of UU if ff is differentiable at every x∈Ix\in I, and differentiable if ff is differentiable on all of UU. We say that ff is continuously differentiable if it is differentiable and dfd f is a continuous function.
The map df xd f_x is called the derivative or differential of ff at xx.
More generally, let n 1,n 2∈ℕn_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N} and let U⊆ℝ n 1U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1} be an open subset.
Then a function f:U⟶ℝ n 2f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2} is differentiable if for all i∈{1,⋯,n 2}i \in \{1, \cdots, n_2\} the component function
f i:U⟶fℝ n 2⟶pr uℝ
  f_i \;\colon\; U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \overset{pr_u}{\longrightarrow}  \mathbb{R}


is differentiable in the previous sense
In this case, the derivatives df i:ℝ n→ℝd f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} of the f if_i assemble into a linear map of the form
df x:ℝ n 1→ℝ n 2.
  d f_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,.


If the derivative exists at each x∈Ux \in U, then it defines itself a function
df:U⟶Hom ℝ(ℝ n 1,ℝ n 2)≃ℝ n 1⋅n 2
  d f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} , \mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \cdot n_2}


to the space of linear maps from ℝ n 1\mathbb{R}^{n_1} to ℝ n 2\mathbb{R}^{n_2}, which is canonically itself a Euclidean space. We say that ff is twice continuously differentiable if dfd f is continuously differentiable.
Generally then, for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} the function ff is called kk-fold continuously differentiable or of class C kC^k if the kk-fold differential d kfd^k f exists and is a continuous function.
Finally, if ff is kk-fold continuously differentiable for all k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} then it is called a smooth function or of class C ∞C^\infty.

Of the various properties satisfied by differentiation, the following plays a special role in the theory of differentiable manifolds (notably in the discussion of their tangent bundles):

Proposition
(chain rule for differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces)
Let n 1,n 2,n 3∈ℕn_1, n_2, n_3 \in \mathbb{N} and let
ℝ n 1⟶fℝ n 2⟶gℝ n 3
  \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
    \overset{g}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_3}


be two differentiable functions (def. ). Then the derivative of their composite is the composite of their derivatives:
d(g∘f)=(dg)∘(df)
  d(g \circ f) = (d g) \circ (d f)


hence for all x∈ℝ n 1x \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1} we have
d(g∘f) x=dg f(x)∘df x.
  d(g \circ f)_x = d g_{f(x)} \circ d f_x
  \,.


Differentiable manifolds

Definition
(differentiable manifold and smooth manifold)
For p∈ℕ∪{∞}p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} then a pp-fold differentiable manifold or C pC^p-manifold for short is


a topological manifold XX (def. );


an atlas {ℝ n→ϕ iX}\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\} (def. ) all whose gluing functions are pp times continuously differentiable.


A pp-fold differentiable function between pp-fold differentiable manifolds
(X,{ℝ n→ϕ iU i⊂X} i∈I)⟶AAfAA(Y,{ℝ n′→ψ jV j⊂Y} j∈J)
  \left(X,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I} \right)
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(Y,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J} \right)


is

a continuous function f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y

such that


for all i∈Ii \in I and j∈Jj \in J then
ℝ n⊃AA(f∘ϕ i) −1(V j)⟶ϕ if −1(V j)⟶fV j⟶ψ j −1ℝ n′
   \mathbb{R}^n
   \supset
    \phantom{AA}
   (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
   f^{-1}(V_j)
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
   V_j
     \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
   \mathbb{R}^{n'}


is a pp-fold differentiable function between open subsets of Euclidean space.


(Notice that this in in general a non-trivial condition even if X=YX = Y and ff is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.)
If a manifold is C pC^p differentiable for all pp, then it is called a smooth manifold. Accordingly a continuous function between differentiable manifolds which is pp-fold differentiable for all pp is called a smooth function,


Remark
(category Diff of differentiable manifolds)
In analogy to remark  there is a category called Diff p{}_p (or similar) whose objects are C pC^p-differentiable manifolds and whose morphisms are C pC^p-differentiable functions, for given p∈ℕ∪{∞}p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}.

The analog of the concept of homeomorphism (def. ) is now this:

Definition
(diffeomorphism)
Given smooth manifolds XX and YY (def. ), then a smooth function
f:X⟶Y
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y


is called a diffeomorphism, if there is an inverse function
X⟵Y:g
  X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g


which is also a smooth function (hence if ff is an isomorphism in the category Diff ∞{}_\infty from remark ).

Here it is important to note that while being a topological manifold is just a property of a topological space, a differentiable manifold carries extra structure encoded in the atlas:

Definition
(smooth structure)
Let XX be a topological manifold (def. ) and let
(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈IAAAandAAA(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
  \right)_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AAA}
   \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
  \right)_{j \in J}


be two atlases (def. ), both making XX into a smooth manifold (def. ).
Then there is a diffeomorphism (def. ) of the form
f:(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈I)⟶≃(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J)
  f
  \;\colon\;
  \left(
    X
      \;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
    \right)_{i \in I}
  \right)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    X\;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
    \right)_{j \in J}
  \right)


precisely if the identity function on the underlying set of XX constitutes such a diffeomorphism. (Because if ff is a diffeomorphism, then also f −1∘f=id Xf^{-1}\circ f = id_X is a diffeomorphism.)
That the identity function is a diffeomorphism between XX equipped with these two atlases means, by definition , that
∀i∈Ij∈J(ϕ i −1(V j)⟶ϕ iV j⟶ψ j −1ℝ nAAis smooth).
  \underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \phi_i^{-1}(V_j) \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
    \phantom{AA}
    \text{is smooth}
  \right)
  \,.


Notice that the functions on the right may equivalently be written as
ℝ n⊃ϕ i −1(U i∩U j)⟶ϕ iU i∩V j⟶ψ j −1ψ j −1(U i∩V j)⊂ℝ n
  \mathbb{R}^n \supset
   \,
   \phi_i^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
    U_i \cap V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \psi_j^{-1}(U_i \cap V_j) \; \subset \mathbb{R}^n


showing their analogy to the glueing functions within a single atlas spring.
Hence diffeomorphism induces an equivalence relation on the set of smooth atlases that exist on a given topological manifold XX. An equivalence class with respect to this equivalence relation is called a smooth structure on XX.


Example
(Cartesian space as a smooth manifold)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} then the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n equipped with the atlas consisting of the single chart ℝ n→idℝ n\mathbb{R}^n \overset{id}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n is a smooth manifold, in particularly a pp-fold differentiable manifold for every p∈ℕp \in \mathbb{N} according to def. .
Similarly the open disk D nD^n becomes a smooth manifold when equipped with the atlas whose single chart is the homeomorphism ℝ n→D n\mathbb{R}^n \to D^n.
This defines a smooth structure (def. ) on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and D nD^n. Strikingly, precisely for n=4n = 4 there are other smooth structures on ℝ 4\mathbb{R}^4, hence called exotic smooth structures.


Example
(n-spheres as smooth manifolds)
For all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the n-sphere S nS^n becomes a smooth manfold, with atlas consisting of the two local charts that are given by the inverse functions of the stereographic projection from the two poles of the sphere onto the equatorial hyperplane
{ℝ n⟶≃σ i −1S n} i∈{+,−}.
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\sigma^{-1}_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.


By the formulas given in this prop. the induced gluing function ℝ n\{0}→ℝ n\{0}\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} is a rational function, and hence a smooth function.
Finally the nn-sphere is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space. Ways to see this include:


S n⊂ℝ n+1S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1} is a compact subspace by the Heine-Borel theorem. Compact spaces are evidently also paracompact. Moreover, Euclidean space, like any metric space, is Hausdorff, and subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff;


The nn-sphere has an evident structure of a CW-complex and CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces.




Example
(real projective space and complex projective space)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}


the real projective space ℝP n\mathbb{R}P^n has the structure of a smooth manifold of dimension nn;


the complex projective space ℂP n\mathbb{C}P^n has the structure of a smooth manifold of (real) dimension 2n2n.


where in both cases the atlas is given by the standard open cover (this def.).

By this prop..
We now discuss some general mechanisms by which new differentiable manifolds arise from given ones:

Example
(product manifold)
Let XX any YY be two differentiable manifolds with atlases {ℝ n→≃ϕ iU i⊂X}\{\mathbb{R}^n\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\} and {ℝ n′→≃ψ jV j⊂Y}\{\mathbb{R}^{n'}\underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}. Then their product topological space X×YX \times Y becomes an differentiable manifold with respect to the atlas
{ℝ n⋅n′→≃ϕ i×ψ jU i×V j⊂X×Y} (i,j)∈I×J
  \left\{
    \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot n'}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i \times \psi_j}{\to}
    U_i \times V_j
      \subset
    X \times Y
  \right\}_{(i,j) \in I \times J}



Example
(open subsets of differentiable manifolds are differentiable manifolds)
Let XX be a kk-fold differentiable manifold and let S⊂XS \subset X be an open subset of the underlying topological space (X,τ)(X,\tau).
Then SS carries the structure of a kk-fold differentiable manifold such that the inclusion map S↪XS \hookrightarrow X is an open embedding of differentiable manifolds.


Proof
Since the underlying topological space of XX is locally connected (this prop.) it is the disjoint union space of its connected components (this prop.).
Therefore we are reduced to showing the statement for the case that XX has a single connected component. By this prop this implies that XX is second-countable topological space.
Now a subspace of a second-countable Hausdorff space is clearly itself second countable and Hausdorff.
Similarly it is immediate that SS is still locally Euclidean: since XX is locally Euclidean every point x∈S⊂Xx \in S \subset X has a Euclidean neighbourhood in XX and since SS is open there exists an open ball in that (itself homeomorphic to Euclidean space) which is a Euclidean neighbourhood of xx contained in SS.
For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas. Then the gluing functions for the Euclidean charts on SS are kk-fold differentiable follows since these are restrictions of the gluing functions for the atlas of XX.


Example
(general linear group)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the general linear group Gl(n,ℝ)Gl(n,\mathbb{R}) is a smooth manifold (as an open subspace of Euclidean space GL(n,ℝ)⊂Mat n×n(ℝ)≃ℝ (n 2)GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}, via example  and example ).
The group operations are smooth functions with respect to this smooth manifold structure, and thus GL(n,ℝ)GL(n,\mathbb{R}) is a Lie group.




A topological manifold XX of dimension n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} is by definition a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to a Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n. A choice of such morphism
ϕ:ℝ n→≃X| im(ϕ)↪X
  \phi : \mathbb{R}^n \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X|_{im(\phi)} \hookrightarrow X


is a coordinate system or coordinate chart or just chart on the image of ϕ\phi.
This generalises to other sorts of manifolds.
An atlas is the collection of coordinate charts defining a manifold structure.

In basic topology and differential geometry, by an atlas of/for a topological-, differentiable- or smooth manifold XX one means a collection of coordinate charts U i⊂XU_i \subset X which form an open cover of XX.
If one considers here the disjoint union 𝒰≔⊔iU i\mathcal{U} \coloneqq \underset{i}{\sqcup} U_i of all the coordinate charts, then the separate chart embeddings U i⊂XU_i \subset X give rise to a single map (continuous/differentiable function)
𝒰⟶X
  \mathcal{U} \longrightarrow X


and now the condition for an atlas is that this is a surjective étale map/local diffeomorphism.
If, next, one regards this morphism, under the Yoneda embedding, inside the topos of formal smooth sets, then these conditions on an atlas say that this morphism is


an effective epimorphism;


a formally étale morphism.


In this abstract form the concept of an atlas generalizes to any cohesive higher geometry (KS 17, Def. 3.3, Wellen 18, Def 4.13, Sati & Schreiber 2020, p. 27).
Next, for a geometric stack 𝒳\mathcal{X}, an atlas is a smooth manifold 𝒰\mathcal{U} (for differentiable stacks) or scheme 𝒰\mathcal{U} (for algebraic stacks) or similar, equipped with a morphism
𝒰⟶𝒳
  \mathcal{U} \longrightarrow \mathcal{X}


that is an effective epimorphism and formally étale morphism in the corresponding higher topos (for instance in that of formal smooth infinity-groupoids).
Here the terminology has a bifurcation:


In the general context of geometric stacks one typically drops the second condition and calls any effective epimorphism from a smooth manifold or scheme to a differentiable stack or algebraic stack, respectively, an atlas (e.g. Leman 10, 4.4).


If in addition the condition is imposed that such an effective epimorphism exists which is also formally étale, then the geometric stack is called an orbifold or Deligne-Mumford stack (often with various further conditions imposed).


From here, the terminology generalizes to 


∞

\infty

-stacks in general 


∞

\infty

-toposes, see this Remark at groupoid objects in an (∞,1)-topos are effective.
 Yet more generally, the notion generalizes to 2-topos theory and higher. Over the point this yields the notion of category with an atlas and flagged categories (depending on the truncation of the atlas) and relates to the notions of flagged higher categories (Ayala & Francis 2018).
A differentiable manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space (a topological manifold) and such that the gluing functions which relate these Euclidean local charts to each other are differentiable functions, for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity, then one speaks of smooth manifolds. For a general discussion see at manifold.
Differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for much of differential geometry. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry.
If one relaxes the condition from being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the concept of diffeological spaces or even smooth sets, see at generalized smooth space for more on this.
The generalization of differentiable manifolds to higher differential geometry are orbifolds and more generally differentiable stacks. If one combines this with the generalization to smooth sets then one obtains the concept of smooth stacks and eventually smooth infinity-stacks.
Smooth manifolds form a category, SmoothManifolds.
Traditional definition
For the traditional definition see at differentiable manifold.
Patching as idempotent splitting
In an exercise of his 1973 Perugia lectures F. William Lawvere reported a somewhat surprising observation:
In the case of smooth manifolds the process of piecing together the local data can be elegantly summed up as splitting of idempotents in a category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces. More precisely:
Let DiffDiff be the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, where by a “smooth manifold”, we mean a finite-dimensional, second-countable, Hausdorff, C ∞C^\infty manifold without boundary. Let i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff be the full subcategory whose objects are the open subspaces of finite-dimensional Cartesian spaces.

Theorem
The subcategory i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff exhibits DiffDiff as an idempotent-splitting completion of OpenOpen.


Proof
By a general lemma for idempotent splittings, it suffices to prove that


Every smooth manifold is a smooth retract of an open set in Euclidean space;


If p:U→Up : U \to U is a smooth idempotent on an open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, then the subset Fix(p)↪UFix(p) \hookrightarrow U is an embedded submanifold.


For the first statement, we use the fact that any manifold MM can be realized as a closed submanifold of some ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, and every closed submanifold has a tubular neighborhood U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n. In this case UU carries a structure of vector bundle over MM in such a way that the inclusion M↪UM \hookrightarrow U is identified with the zero section, so that the bundle projection U→MU \to M provides a retraction, with right inverse given by the zero section.
For the second statement, assume that the origin 00 is a fixed point of pp, and let T 0(U)≅ℝ nT_0(U) \cong \mathbb{R}^n be its tangent space (observe the presence of a canonical isomorphism to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n). Thus we have idempotent linear maps dp(0),Id−dp(0):T 0(U)→T 0(U)d p(0), Id-d p(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(U) where the latter factors through the inclusion kerdp(0)↪T 0(U)\ker \; d p(0) \hookrightarrow T_0(U) via a projection map π:T 0(U)→kerdp(0)\pi: T_0(U) \to \ker \; d p(0). We have a map f:U→ℝ nf: U \to \mathbb{R}^n that takes x∈Ux \in U to x−p(x)x - p(x); let gg denote the composite
U⟶fℝ n≅T 0(U)⟶πkerdp(0).U \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n \cong T_0(U) \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \ker\; d p(0).
Now we make some easy observations:


Fix(p)⊆g −1(0)Fix(p) \subseteq g^{-1}(0).


The map p:U→Up: U \to U restricts to a map p:g −1(0)→g −1(0)p: g^{-1}(0) \to g^{-1}(0), by idempotence of pp.


The derivative dg(0):T 0(U)→T 0(kerdp(0))≅kerdp(0)d g(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(\ker \; d p(0)) \cong \ker \; d p(0) is π\pi again since Id−dp(0)Id - d p(0) is idempotent. Thus dg(0)d g(0) has full rank (mm say), and so the restriction of gg to some neighborhood VV has 00 as a regular value, and g −1(0)∩Vg^{-1}(0) \cap V is a manifold of dimension mm by the implicit function theorem. The tangent space T 0(g −1(0)∩V)T_0(g^{-1}(0) \cap V) is canonically identified with im(dp(0))im(d p(0)).


There are smaller neighborhoods V″⊆V′⊆VV'' \subseteq V' \subseteq V so that pp restricts to maps p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 as in the following diagram (i,i′,i″i, i', i'' are inclusion maps, all taking a domain element xx to itself):
g −1(0)∩V″ ↪i″ g −1(0) p 2↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V′ ↪i′ g −1(0) p 1↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V ↪i g −1(0)\array{
g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' & \stackrel{i''}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_2} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V' & \stackrel{i'}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_1} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0)
}

and such that p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 are diffeomorphisms by the inverse function theorem (noting here that dp i(0):im(dp(0))→im(dp(0))d p_i(0): im(d p(0)) \to im(d p(0)) is the identity map, by idempotence of pp).


Letting q:g −1(0)∩V′→g −1(0)∩V″q: g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \to g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' denote the smooth inverse to p 2p_2, we calculate i′=p∘i″∘qi' = p \circ i'' \circ q, and
ip 1=pi′=ppi″q=pi″q=i′,i p_1 = p i' = p p i''q = p i'' q = i',
so that p 1(x)=xp_1(x) = x for every x∈g −1(0)∩V′x \in g^{-1}(0) \cap V'. Hence g −1(0)∩V′⊆Fix(p)g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \subseteq Fix(p).


From all this it follows that Fix(p)∩V′=g −1(0)∩V′Fix(p) \cap V' = g^{-1}(0) \cap V', meaning Fix(p)Fix(p) is locally diffeomorphic to ℝ m\mathbb{R}^m, and so Fix(p)Fix(p) is an embedded submanifold of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.


Remark
Another proof of this result may be found here.

Lawvere comments on this fact as follows:

 “This powerful theorem justifies bypassing the complicated considerations of charts, coordinate transformations, and atlases commonly offered as a ”basic“ definition of the concept of manifold. For example the 2-sphere, a manifold but not an open set of any Euclidean space, may be fully specified with its smooth structure by considering any open set AA in 3-space EE which contains it but not its center (taken to be 00) and the smooth idempotent endomap of AA given by e(x)=x/|x|e(x) = x/{|x|}. All general constructions (i.e., functors into categories which are Cauchy complete) on manifolds now follow easily (without any need to check whether they are compatible with coverings, etc.) provided they are known on the opens of Euclidean spaces: for example, the tangent bundle on the sphere is obtained by splitting the idempotent e′e' on the tangent bundle A×VA \times V of AA (VV being the vector space of translations of EE) which is obtained by differentiating ee. The same for cohomology groups, etc.” (Lawvere 1989, p.267)

General abstract geometric definition
There is a fundamental and general abstract way to think of smooth manifolds, which realizes their theory as a special case of general constructions in higher geometry.
In this context one specifies for instance 𝒢\mathcal{G} a geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) and then plenty of geometric notions are defined canonically in terms of 𝒢\mathcal{G}. The theory of smooth manifolds appears if one takes 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp.
Alternatively one can specify differential cohesion and proceed as discussed at differential cohesion – structures - Cohesive manifolds (separated).
This is discussed in The geometry CartSp below.

Let CartSp be the category of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them. This has finite products and is in fact (the syntactic category) of a Lawvere theory: the theory of smooth algebras.
Moreover, CartSpCartSp is naturally equipped with the good open cover coverage that makes it a site.
Both properties together make it a pregeometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) (if the notion of Grothendieck topology is relaxed to that of coverage in StrSp).
For 𝒳\mathcal{X} a topos, a product-preserving functor
𝒪:𝒢→𝒳
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}


is a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. This makes 𝒳\mathcal{X} is 𝒢\mathcal{G}-ringed topos. For 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp this algebra is a smooth algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. If 𝒳\mathcal{X} has a site of definition XX, then this is a sheaf of smooth algebras on XX.
If 𝒪\mathcal{O} sends covering families {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} in 𝒢\mathcal{G} to effective epimorphism ∐ i𝒪(U i)→𝒪(U)\coprod_i \mathcal{O}(U_i) \to \mathcal{O}(U) we say that it is a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}, making 𝒳\mathcal{X} a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally ringed topos.
The big topos Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) itself is canonically equipped with such a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra, given by the Yoneda embedding jj followed by sheafification LL
𝒪:𝒢→jPSh(𝒢)→LSh(𝒢).
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(\mathcal{G}) \stackrel{L}{\to}
  Sh(\mathcal{G})
  \,.


It is important in the context of locally representable locally ringed toposes that we regard Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) as equipped with this local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra. This is what remembers the site and gives a notion of local representability in the first place.
The big topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is a cohesive topos of generalized smooth spaces. Its concrete sheaves are precisely the diffeological spaces. See there for more details. We now discuss how with Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) regarded as a CartSpCartSp-structured topos, smooth manifolds are precisely its locally representable objects.
Cartesian spaces as representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)
The representables themselves should evidently be locally representable and canonically have the structure of CartSpCartSp-structured toposes.
Indeed, every object U∈CartSpU \in \mathrm{CartSp} is canonically a CartSp-ringed space, meaning a topological space equipped with a local sheaf of smooth algebras. More generally: every object U∈CartSpU \in CartSp is canonically incarnated as the CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos

Smooth manifolds as locally representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)

Definition
Say a concrete object XX in the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) – a diffeological space – is locally representable if there exists a family of open embeddings {U i↪X} i∈X\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}_{i \in X} with U i∈CartSp↪jSh(CartSp)U_i \in CartSp \stackrel{j}{\hookrightarrow} Sh(CartSp) such that the canonical morphism out of the coproduct
∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_i U_i \to X


is an effective epimorphism in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp).
Let LocRep(CartSp)↪Sh(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) be the full subcategory on locally representable sheaves.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of categories
Diff≃LocRep(CartSp)
  Diff \simeq LocRep(CartSp)


of the category Diff of smooth manifolds with that of locally representable sheaves for the pre-geometry CartSpCartSp.


Proof
Define a functor Diff→LocRep(CartSp)Diff \to LocRep(CartSp) by sending each smooth manifold to the sheaf over CartSpCartSp that it naturally represents. By definition of manifold there is an open cover {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}. We claim that ∐ iU i→X\coprod_i U_i \to X is an effective epimorphism, so that this functor indeed lands in LocRep(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp). (This is a standard argument of sheaf theory in Diff, we really only need to observe that it goes through over CartSp, too.)
For that we need to show that
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to X


is a coequalizer diagram in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) (that the Cech groupoid of the cover is equivalent to XX.). Notice that the fiber product here is just the intersection in XX U i× XU j≃U i∩U jU_i \times_X U_j \simeq U_i \cap U_j. By the fact that the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is by definition a reflective subcategory of the presheaf topos PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) we have that colimits in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are computed as the sheafification of the corresponding colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). The colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) in turn is computed objectwise. Using this, we see that that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→S({U i})
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to S(\{U_i\})


in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp), where S({U i})S(\{U_i\}) is the sieve corresponding to the cover: the subfunctor S({U i})↪XS(\{U_i\}) \hookrightarrow X of the functor X:CartSp op→SetX : CartSp^{op} \to Set  which assigns to V∈CartSpV \in CartSp the set of smooth functions V→XV \to X that have the property that they factor through any one of the U iU_i.
Essentially by the definition of the coverage on CartSpCartSp, it follows that sheafification takes this subfunctor inclusion to an isomorphism. This shows that XX is indeed the tip of the coequalizer in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) as above, and hence that it is a locally representable sheaf.
Conversely, suppose that for X∈Conc(Sh(CartSp))↪Sh(CartSp)X \in Conc(Sh(CartSp)) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) there is a family of open embeddings {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\} such that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_{i} U_i \to X


in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp), which is the sheafification of the corresponding coequalizer in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). By evaluating this on the point, we find that the underlying set of XX is the coequalizer of the underlying set of the U iU_i in SetSet. Since every plot of XX factors locally through one of the U iU_i it follows that XX is a diffeological space.
It follows that in the pullback diagrams
U i× XU j → U j ↓  ↓ U i → X
  \array{
    U_i \times_X U_j &\to& U_j
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   U_i &\to& X 
  }


the object U i∩U jU_i \cap U_j is the diffeological space whose underlying topological space is the intersection of U iU_i and U jU_j in the topological space underlying XX. In particular the inclusions U i× XU j↪U iU_i \times_X U_j \hookrightarrow U_i are open embeddings.

As locally representable CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
We may switch from regarding smooth manifolds as objects in the big topos X∈Sh(CartSp)X \in Sh(CartSp) to regrading them as toposes themselves, by passing to the over-topos Sh(CartSp)/XSh(CartSp)/X. This remembers the extra (smooth) structure on the topological space XX by being canonically a locally ringed topos with the structure sheaf of smooth functions on XX: a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-toposes
For every choice of geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) there is a notion of 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally representable structured (∞,1)-topos (StrSp).

Claim
Smooth manifolds are equivalently the 0-localic CartSp-generalized schemes of locally finite presentation.


Sketch of proof
The statement says that a smooth manifold XX may be identified with an ∞-stack on CartSp (an ∞-Lie groupoid) which is represented by a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos (𝒳,𝒪 𝒳)(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}) such that


𝒳\mathcal{X} is a 0-localic (∞,1)-topos;


There exists a family of objects {U i∈𝒳}\{U_i \in \mathcal{X}\} such that the canonical morphism ∐ iU i→* 𝒳\coprod_i U_i \to *_{\mathcal{X}} to the terminal object in 𝒳\mathcal{X} is a regular epimorphism;


For every i∈Ii \in I there is an equivalence


(𝒳/U i,𝒪 𝒳|U i)→≃t i(Sh (∞,1)(ℝ n),𝒪(ℝ n)).
    (\mathcal{X}/U_i, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}|U_i})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{t_i}{\to} (Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\mathbb{R}^n), \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{R}^n))
     \,.
  

The second and third condition say in words that (𝒳,𝒪 𝒳)(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}) is locally equivalent to the ordinary cannonically CartSp-locally ringed space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n (for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} the dimension. The first condition then says that these local identifications cover 𝒳\mathcal{X}.

The functor

(from the category of smooth manifolds to the opposite category of commutative algebras over the real numbers) that sends a smooth manifold XX to its commutative ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra of smooth functions X→ℝX \to \mathbb{R} is a fully faithful functor, hence exhibits SmthMfdSmthMfd as a full subcategory of cAlg opcAlg^{op}.

Further properties


Borel's theorem


Tietze extension theorem


Whitney extension theorem


Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem


derivations of smooth functions are vector fields


A differential structure on a topological space XX is the extra structure of a differential manifold on XX. A smooth structure on XX is the extra structure of a smooth manifold.

Definition
(smooth structure)
Let XX be a topological manifold and let
(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈IAAAandAAA(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
  \right)_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AAA}
   \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
  \right)_{j \in J}


be two atlases, both making XX into a smooth manifold (this def.).
Then there is a diffeomorphism of the form
f:(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈I)⟶≃(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J)
  f
  \;\colon\;
  \left(
    X 
      \;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
    \right)_{i \in I}    
  \right)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    X\;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
    \right)_{j \in J}
  \right)


precisely if the identity function on the underlying set of XX constitutes such a diffeomorphism. (Because if ff is a diffeomorphism, then also f −1∘f=id Xf^{-1}\circ f = id_X is a diffeomorphism.)
That the identity function is a diffeomorphism between XX equipped with these two atlases means (by definition) that
∀i∈Ij∈J(ϕ i −1(V j)⟶ϕ iV j⟶ψ j −1ℝ nAAis smooth).
  \underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \phi_i^{-1}(V_j) \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
    \phantom{AA}
    \text{is smooth}
  \right)
  \,.


Hence diffeomorphsm induces an equivalence relation on the set of smooth atlases that exist on a given topological manifold XX. An equivalence class with respect to this equivalence relation is called a smooth structure on XX.


Theorem
(uniqueness of smooth structure on Euclidean space in d≠4d \neq 4)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} a natural number with n≠4n \neq 4, there is a unique (up to isomorphism) smooth structure on the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.

This was shown in (Stallings 62).

Theorem
In d=4d = 4 the analog of this statement is false. One says that on ℝ 4\mathbb{R}^4 there exist exotic smooth structures.

Exotic smooth structures
Many topological spaces have canonical or “obvious” smooth structures. For instance a Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n has the evident smooth structure induced from the fact that it can be covered by a single chart – itself.
From this example, various topological spaces inherit a canonical smooth structure by embedding. For instance the nn-sphere may naturally be thought of as the collection of points
S n↪ℝ n
  S^n \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n 


given by S n={x→∈ℝ n|∑ i(x i) 2=1}S^n = \{\vec x \in \mathbb{R}^n | \sum_i (x^i)^2 = 1\} and this induces a smooth structure of 𝕊 n\mathbb{S}^n.
But there may be other, non-equivalent smooth structures than these canonical ones. These are called exotic smooth structures. See there for more details.
An exotic smooth structure is, roughly speaking, a smooth structure on a topological manifold XX which makes the resulting smooth manifold be non-diffeomorphic to the smooth manifold given by some evident ‘standard’ smooth structure on XX.
Mostly the term is used for smooth structures on Euclidean space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and on the n-spheres S nS^n, for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}. The standard smooth structure on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n is exhibited by the identity atlas, and the standard smooth structure on S nS^n is that given by the atlas of the two hemispheres as given by stereographic projection.
For special values of nn there may exist smooth structure not equivalent to these. They are the exotic smooth structures.
A classification of smooth, PL and topological structures on manifolds in dimension 5 and higher, in terms of various groups from algebraic topology (many not known) was established by Kirby and Siebenmann (1977) using obstruction theory.
An analytic manifold is a manifold with analytic transition functions over some field. The most widely studied are real-analytic and complex analytic manifolds.
Analytic manifolds are studied in analytic geometry.
A complex manifold is a manifold holomorphically modeled on polydiscs DD in ℂ n\mathbb{C}^n (complexified nn-dimensional cartesian space):


a smooth manifold locally isomorphic to D↪ℂ nD \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^n whose transition functions are holomorphic functions;


equivalently: a smooth manifold equipped with an integrable almost complex structure;


equivalently a smooth complex analytic space.


Covers

Proposition
Every complex manifold admits a good open cover in Disk cmplDisk_{cmpl}.

For instance (Maddock, lemma 3.2.8).
A formal smooth manifold is a smooth manifold equipped possibly with infinitesimal extension.
In the differential cohesion of synthetic differential infinity-groupoids these are the spaces locally isomorphic to ℝ n×D\mathbb{R}^n \times D, where ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n is a Cartesian space and DD is an infinitesimally thickened point. Here ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n is the underlying reduced manifold.
A derived smooth manifold is the generalization of a smooth manifold in derived differential geometry: the derived geometry over the Lawvere theory for smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings):
it is a structured (∞,1)-topos whose structure sheaf of functions is a smooth (∞,1)-algebra.
The following definition characterizes the design criterion for derived smooth manifolds as being objects for which homotopy-intersections
A∩ XB:=A× X hB
  A \cap_X B := A \times_X^h B


preserve the cup product in the cobordism ring
[A]⌣[B]≃[A∩ XB].
  [A] \smile [B] \simeq [A \cap_X B]
  \,.



Definition
We say an (∞,1)-category CC supports derived cup products for cobordisms if


it is equipped with a full and faithful functor
i:Diff↪C
  i : Diff \hookrightarrow C


embedding the category of smooth manifolds into it;


for any two submanifolds A→X←BA \to X \leftarrow B (transversal or not) the (∞,1)-pullback
A∩ XB:=i(A)× i(X)i(B)
  A \cap_X B := i(A) \times_{i(X)} i(B)


exists in CC;


if A→X←BA \to X \leftarrow B happen to be transverse maps then
i(A× XB)≃i(A)× i(X)i(B),
  i(A \times_X B) \simeq i(A) \times_{i(X)} i(B)
  \,,


with the image under ii of the ordinary pullback in Diff on the left;


ii preserves the terminal object;


(…nice interaction with underlying topological spaces…)


for each X∈DiffX \in Diff there is a derived cobordism ring Ω(X)\Omega(X) such that …


for any submanifolds A→X←BA \to X \leftarrow B we have
[A]⌣[B]=[A∩ XB]
  [A] \smile [B] = [A \cap_X B]  


in Ω(X)\Omega(X)

A central statement about derived smooth manifolds will be

Theorem
The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category of derived smooth manifolds has derived cup products for cobordisms.

This is (Spivak, theorm 1.8).
The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


A diffeological space is a type of generalized smooth space. As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of smooth manifold but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren’t manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see manifolds of mapping spaces.)
In a little more detail, a diffeology, 𝒟\mathcal{D} on a set XX is a presheaf on the category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms. To each open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, it assigns a subset of Set(U,X)\Set(U,X). The functions in Set(U,X)\Set(U,X) are to be regarded as the “smooth functions” from UU to XX. A diffeological space is then a set together with a diffeology on it.
Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in (Souriau 79). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook (Iglesias-Zemmour 13)

Definition
Let 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} denote the site whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and whose morphisms are smooth maps between these. The Grothendieck topology on 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} is generated by the coverage of open covers, i.e., a family of maps {U i→X} i∈I\{U_i\to X\}_{i\in I} is a covering family if every map U i→XU_i\to X is an open embedding and the union of the images of U iU_i in XX equals XX.
A diffeological space is a pair (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) where


XX is a set


and 𝒟∈Sh(𝒪𝓅)\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op}) is a diffeology on XX:


a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦Hom Set(U,X)U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X) with 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X


equivalently: a concrete sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} such that 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X - a concrete smooth space (see there for more details).




A morphism of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding sheaves: we take DiffeologicalSp↪Sh(CartSp)DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) to be the full subcategory on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

For (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) a diffeological space, and for any U∈𝒪𝓅U \in \mathcal{Op}, the set 𝒟(U)\mathcal{D}(U) is also called the set of plots in XX on UU. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping UU smoothly into the would-be space XX. This assignment defined what it means for a map U→XU \to X of sets to be smooth.
For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized spaces see motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
A sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to CartSp, the full subcategory of Cartesian space: The fully faithful functor CartSp↪𝒪𝓅CartSp \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Op} is a dense subsite-inclusion. Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to CartSp.
One may define a smooth sets to be any sheaf of CartSp. A diffeological space is equivalently a concrete sheaf on the concrete site CartSp. (For details see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.)
The full subcategory
DiffeologicalSpaces↪Sh(CartSp)
  DiffeologicalSpaces \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)


on all concrete sheaves is not a topos, but is a quasitopos.
This is Prop.  below.
The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦X |U|U \mapsto X^{|U|}. In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set XX as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0.
Relation to topological and Δ\Delta-generated spaces

between the categories of TopologicalSpaces and of DiffeologicalSpaces, where


CdfflgCdfflg takes a topological space XX to the continuous diffeology, namely the diffeological space on the same underlying set X sX_s whose plots U s→X sU_s \to X_s are the continuous functions (from the underlying topological space of the domain UU).


DtplgDtplg takes a diffeological space to the diffeological topology (D-topology), namely the topological space with the same underlying set X sX_s and with the final topology that makes all its plots U s→X sU_{s} \to X_{s} into continuous functions: called the D-topology.
Hence a subset O⊂♭XO \subset \flat X is an open subset in the D-topology precisely if for each plot f:U→Xf \colon U \to X the preimage f −1(O)⊂Uf^{-1}(O) \subset U is an open subset in the Cartesian space UU.


Moreover:


the fixed points of this adjunction X∈X \inTopologicalSpaces (those for which the counit is an isomorphism, hence here: a homeomorphism) are precisely the Delta-generated topological spaces (i.e. D-topological spaces):

this is an idempotent adjunction, which exhibits Δ\Delta-generated/D-topological spaces as a reflective subcategory inside diffeological spaces and a coreflective subcategory inside all topological spaces:

Caution: There was a gap in the original proof that DTopologicalSpaces≃ QuillenDiffeologicalSpacesDTopologicalSpaces \simeq_{Quillen} DiffeologicalSpaces. The gap is claimed to be filled now, see the commented references here.


Essentially these adjunctions and their properties are observed in Shimakawa, Yoshida & Haraguchi 2010, Prop. 3.1, Prop. 3.2, Lem. 3.3, see also Christensen, Sinnamon & Wu 2014, Sec. 3.2. The model structures and Quillen equivalences are due to Haraguchi 13, Thm. 3.3 (on the left) and Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13, Sec. 7 (on the right).

is a function f s:X s→Y sf_s \colon X_s \to Y_s of the underlying sets such that for every open subset A⊂Y sA \subset Y_s and every smooth function of the form ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X the preimage (f s∘ϕ s) −1(A)⊂ℝ n(f_s \circ \phi_s)^{-1}(A) \subset \mathbb{R}^n is open. But this means equivalently that for every such ϕ\phi, f∘ϕf \circ \phi is continuous. This, in turn, means equivalently that the same underlying function f sf_s constitutes a smooth function f˜:X⟶Cdfflg(Y)\widetilde f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Cdfflg(Y).
In summary, we thus have a bijection of hom-sets
Hom(Dtplg(X),Y) ≃ Hom(X,Cdfflg(Y)) f s ↦ (f˜) s=f s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(X), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(X, Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    f_s &\mapsto& (\widetilde f)_s = f_s
  }


given simply as the identity on the underlying functions of underlying sets. This makes it immediate that this hom-isomorphism is natural in XX and YY and this establishes the adjunction.
Next, to see that the D-topological spaces are the fixed points of this adjunction, we apply the above natural bijection on hom-sets to the case
Hom(Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)),Y) ≃ Hom(Cdfflg(Z),Cdfflg(Y)) (ϵ Z) s ↦ (id) s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(Cdfflg(Z), Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    (\epsilon_Z)_s &\mapsto& (\mathrm{id})_s
  }


to find that the counit of the adjunction
Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶ϵ XX
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \overset{\epsilon_X}{\longrightarrow}
  X


is given by the identity function on the underlying sets (ϵ X) s=id (X s)(\epsilon_X)_s = id_{(X_s)}.
Therefore η X\eta_X is an isomorphism, namely a homeomorphism, precisely if the open subsets of X sX_s with respect to the topology on XX are precisely those with respect to the topology on Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))Dtplg(Cdfflg(X)), which means equivalently that the open subsets of XX coincide with those whose pre-images under all continuous functions ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X are open. This means equivalently that XX is a D-topological space.
Finally, to see that we have an idempotent adjunction, it is sufficient to check (by this Prop.) that the comonad
Dtplg∘Cdfflg:TopologicalSpaces→TopologicalSpaces
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \;\colon\; TopologicalSpaces \to TopologicalSpaces


is an idempotent comonad, hence that
Dtplg∘Cdfflg⟶Dtplg⋅η⋅CdfflgDtplg∘Cdfflg∘Dtplg∘Cdfflg
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg
  \overset{
    Dtplg \cdot \eta \cdot Cdfflg
  }{\longrightarrow}
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \circ Dtplg \circ Cdfflg


is a natural isomorphism. But, as before for the adjunction counit ϵ\epsilon, we have that also the adjunction unit η\eta is the identity function on the underlying sets. Therefore, this being a natural isomorphism is equivalent to the operation of passing to the D-topological refinement of the topology of a topological space being an idempotent operation, which is clearly the case.


Further discussion of the D-topology is in CSW 13.
Topological homotopy type and diffeological shape

(diffeological singular simplicial set)
Consider the simplicial diffeological space

which in degree nn is the standard extended n-simplex inside Cartesian space ℝ n+1\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, equipped with its sub-diffeology.
This induces a nerve and realization adjunction between diffeological spaces and simplicial sets:

where the right adjoint is the diffeological singular simplicial set functor Sing diffSing_{diff}.

(e.g. Christensen-Wu 13, Def. 4.3)

Remark
(diffeological singular simplicial set as path ∞-groupoid)
Regarding simplicial sets as presenting ∞-groupoids, we may think of Sing diff(X)Sing_{diff}(X) (Def. ) as the path ∞-groupoid of the diffeological space XX.
In fact, by the discussion at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid we have that Sing diffSing_{diff} is equvialent to the shape of diffeological spaces regarded as objects of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids:
Sing diff≃Shp∘i:DiffeologicalSpaces↪iSmoothGroupoids ∞⟶ShapeGroupoids ∞

Proposition
(topological homotopy type is cohesive shape of continuous diffeology)  For every X∈X \in TopologicalSpaces, the cohesive shape/path ∞-groupoid presented by its diffeological singular simplicial set (Def. , Remark ) of its continuous diffeology is naturally\,weak homotopy equivalent to the homotopy type of XX presented by the ordinary singular simplicial set:
Sing diff(Cdfflg(X))⟶∈W whSing(X).

(Christensen & Wu 2013, Prop. 4.14)



Proposition
(diffeological internal hom on D-topological spaces has correct cohesive shape)  For X,A∈DTopSp↪TopSpX, A \,\in\, DTopSp \hookrightarrow TopSp a pair of D-topological spaces, their internal hom formed in diffeological spaces has diffeological singular simplicial complex Sing diff(−)Sing_{diff}(-) (3) weakly homotopy equivalent to the ordinary singular simplicial set Sing(−)Sing(-) of the ordinary mapping space Maps TopMaps_{Top} with its compact-open topology:

By SYH 10 we have the following morphism:

where smap\mathbf{smap} is some topologization of the set of maps (defined on their p. 6 ) of which all we need to know is that:


(shown on the right of (4)) its image under CdfflgCdfflg is isomorphic to the internal hom Maps dfflgMaps_{dfflg} in diffeological spaces, according to their Prop. 4.7 (p. 7),


(shown on the left of (4)) it is weak homotopy equivalent, via some map ϕ\phi according to their Prop. 5.4 (p. 9) to the compact-open topology.


Hence the claim follows by using 2-out-of-3 in the naturality square of the natural weak homotopy equivalence from Prop.

Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces

Proposition
The obvious functor from the category SmoothManifolds of smooth manifolds to the category DiffeologicalSpaces of diffeological spaces is a full and faithful functor
SmoothManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpacess.
  SmoothManifolds \hookrightarrow  DiffeologicalSpacess
  \,.



Proof
This is a direct consequence of the fact that CartSpsmooth_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothManifolds and the Yoneda lemma.
It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:
To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if f,g:X→Yf,g : X \to Y are two smooth functions that differ at some point, then they must differ in some open neighbourhood of that point. This open ball is a plot, hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that plot.
To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets f:X→Yf : X \to Y that sends plots to plots is necessarily a smooth function, hence that all its derivatives exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves γ:(0,1)→X\gamma : (0,1) \to X in XX. By Boman's theorem, a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular plots, so a function that takes all plots of XX to plots of YY must be smooth.


Remark
The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site CartSp dim≤1⊂CartSpCartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp on the objects ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0 and ℝ 1\mathbb{R}^1 and still have a full and faithful embedding
Diff↪Sh(CartSp dim≤1).
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.


This fact plays a role in the definition of Frölicher spaces, which are generalized smooth spaces defined by plots by curves into and out of them.
While the site CartSp dim≤1CartSp_{dim \leq 1} is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp dim≤1)Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1}) lacks some non-concrete sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree ≥2\geq 2.

Embedding of smooth manifolds with boundary into diffeological spaces

Proposition
(manifolds with boundaries and corners form full subcategory of diffeological spaces)
The evident functor
SmthMfdWBdrCrn↪AAAADiffeologicalSpaces
  SmthMfdWBdrCrn \overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\hookrightarrow} DiffeologicalSpaces


from the category of smooth manifolds with boundaries and corners to that of diffeological spaces is fully faithful, hence is a full subcategory-embedding.

(Iglesias-Zemmour 13, 4.16, Gürer & Iglesias-Zemmour 19)
Embedding of Banach manifolds into diffeological spaces
Also Banach manifolds embed fully faithfully into the category of diffeological spaces. In (Hain) this is discussed in terms of Chen smooth spaces.
Embedding of Fréchet manifolds into diffeological spaces
We discuss a natural embedding of Fréchet manifolds into the category of diffeological spaces.

Definition
Define a functor
ι:FrechetManifolds→DiffeologicalSpaces
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces


in the evident way by taking for XX a Fréchet manifold for any U∈U \in  CartSp the set of UU-plots of ι(X)\iota(X) to be the set of smooth functions U→XU \to X.


Proposition
The functor ι:FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.

This appears as (Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1, following Losik 92), as variant of the analogous statement for Banach manifolds in (Hain). The fact that maps between Fréchet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in (Frölicher 81, théorème 1)
The statement is also implied by (Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14) which states that functions between locally convex vector spaces are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth curves to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses Michal-Bastiani smoothness (Glöckner 06), in which case one merely has a faithful functor lctvs→DiffeologicalSpaceslctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces. Notice that the choice of topology in (Kriegl-Michor 97) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fréchet manifolds.

Proposition
Let X,Y∈SmoothManifoldX, Y \in SmoothManifold with XX a compact manifold.
Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}:
ι(C ∞(X,Y) Fr)≃C ∞(X,Y) diff.
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.


This appears as (Waldorf 09, lemma A.1.7).
\,
Embedding of diffeological spaces into smooth sets
We discuss how diffeological spaces are equivalently the concrete objects in the cohesive topos of smooth sets (see there).

Proposition
(diffeological spaces are the concrete smooth sets)
The full subcategory on the concrete objects in the topos SmoothSet≔Sh(Cart)SmoothSet \coloneqq Sh(Cart) of smooth sets is equivalent to the category of diffeological spaces


Proof
The concrete sheaves for the local topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are by definition those objects XX for which the (Γ⊣CoDisc)(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)-unit
X→CoDiscΓX
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X


is a monomorphism. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every U∈CartSpU \in CartSp we have that
X(U)≃Hom Sh(U,X)→Hom Sh(U,CodiscΓX)≃Hom Set(ΓU,ΓX)
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)


is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

For a fully detailed proof see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is a quasitopos.


Proof
This follows from the discussion at Locality.

This has some immediate general abstract consequences

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is


a cartesian closed category


a closed monoidal category.



Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the concrete objects is the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)≃Sh(SmthMfd)Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd) of smooth sets. This is a general context for differential geometry. From there one can pass further to higher differential geometry: the topos of smooth sets in turn embeds
Sh(CartSp)↪Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp)
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 


into the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of “higher smooth sets” –smooth ∞-groupoids – as precisely the 0-truncated objects.
Distribution theory
Since a space of smooth functions on a smooth manifold is canonically a diffeological space, it is natural to consider the smooth linear functionals on such mapping spaces. These turn out to be equivalent to the continuous linear functionals, hence to distributional densities. See at distributions are the smooth linear functionals for details.
The category of smooth manifolds is not cartesian closed, even when infinite-dimensional manifolds are allowed. However, that does not mean that no mapping spaces between certain smooth manifolds can be given the structure of a smooth manifold. This is true when the source is compact. Thus, in particular, this applies to loop spaces.
The method of proving this depends mostly on the structure of the target and only minimally on that of the source. It is not hard to generalise it to manifolds with boundary (to get, for example, path spaces), or even manifolds with corners. This raises the obvious question as to how general this result can be made. The purpose of this page is to determine the answer. Our conjecture is the following:

Conjecture
Let NN be a Frölicher space whose curvaceous topology is sequentially compact. Let MM be a smooth manifold that admits a local addition. Then the Frölicher space of smooth maps from NN to MM is a smooth manifold.

Relation between diffeological and Fréchet manifold structure
Since smooth manifolds form a full subcategory of diffeological spaces, the mapping space C ∞(X,Y)C^\infty(X,Y) between two manifolds always exists canonically as a diffeological space:

Definition
For U∈U \in  CartSp, a smooth plot of C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} over UU is a smooth function U×X→YU \times X \to Y (hence a UU-parameterized smooth collection of smooth functions X→YX \to Y).

If XX is a compact manifold then there is also the structure of a Fréchet manifold C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr} on the mapping space. We discuss that and how these two smooth structures coincide.

Definition
Define a functor
ι:FrechetManifolds→DiffeologicalSpaces
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces


in the evident way by taking for XX a Fréchet manifold for any U∈U \in  CartSp the set of UU-plots of ι(X)\iota(X) to be the set of smooth functions U→XU \to X.


Proposition
The functor ι:FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.

This appears as (Losik, theorem 3.1.1).
Since moreover diffeological spaces are fully faithful in smooth sets (them being precisely the concrete objects in smooth sets), this implies in particular that Frechet manifolds are fully faithful in smooth sets
FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces↪SmoothSets.
  FrechetManifolds 
    \hookrightarrow 
  DiffeologicalSpaces
    \hookrightarrow
  SmoothSets
  \,.



Proposition
Let X,Y∈SMoothManifoldX, Y \in SMoothManifold with XX a compact manifold.
Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}:
ι(C ∞(X,Y) Fr)≃C ∞(X,Y) diff.
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.


This appears as (Waldorf, lemma A.1.7).
The tangent bundle TX→XT X \to X of a (sufficiently differentiable) space XX is a bundle over XX whose fiber over a point x∈Xx \in X is the tangent space at that point, namely the collection of infinitesimal curves in XX emanating at xx: “tangent vectors”.
For nice enough spaces such as differentiable manifolds or more generally microlinear spaces, the tangent bundle of XX is a vector bundle over XX.



For example the graphics on the right shows the 2-sphere with one of its tangent spaces. The tangent bundle of the sphere is the union of all these tangent spaces, regarded as a topological bundle of vector space (a vector bundle) over the 2-sphere.

graphics grabbed from Hatcher

With a notion of tangent bundle comes the following terminology


A tangent vector on XX at x∈Xx \in X is an element of T xXT_x X.


The tangent space of XX at a point xx is the fiber T x(X)T_x(X) of TXT X over xx;.


A tangent vector field on XX is a section of TXT X.


The precise definition of tangent bundle depends on the nature of the ambient category of spaces. Below we give first the traditional definitions in ordinary differential geometry. Then we discuss the construction in more general context of smooth toposes in synthetic differential geometry and other categories of generalized smooth spaces.
Traditional
Given a kk-vector bundle p:E→Mp\colon E \to M of finite rank nn, its frame bundle (or bundle of frames in E→ME \to M) is the bundle FE→MF E \to M over the same base whose fiber over x∈Mx \in M is the set of all vector space bases of E x=p −1(x)E_x = p^{-1}(x). The frame bundle has a natural action of GL n(k)GL_n(k) given by an ordered change of basis which is free and transitive, i. e., the frame bundle is a principal GL n(k)GL_n(k)-bundle.
The frame bundle of a manifold MM is the principal bundle FTM→MF T M \to M (also denoted FM→MF M \to M) of frames in the tangent bundle TMT M.
In the finite-dimensional case, the dual GL nGL_n-principal bundle (FT) *M(F T)^* M is the coframe bundle of the manifold. This means that F *M=(FT) *MF^* M = (F T)^* M is the associated bundle to FTM× GL n(k)GL n(k)F T M \times_{GL_n(k)}GL_n(k) where the left action of GL n(k)GL_n(k) on GL n(k)GL_n(k) is given by right multiplication by inverses g.h=h⋅g −1g. h = h\cdot g^{-1}. Also FTM≅(FT) *M× GL n(k)GL n(k)F T M\cong (F T)^* M\times_{GL_n(k)} GL_n(k) using the same formula. Furthermore, the right action of GL n(k)GL_n(k) on this associated bundle is given by left multiplication by inverses on GL n(k)GL_n(k) factor.
Coframe bundle F *MF^* M has the following independent description. One looks at the set 𝒰(M)\mathcal{U}(M) of tuples of the form (p,(U,h))(p,(U,h)) where p∈Up\in U and (U,h)(U,h) is chart of the smooth structure on MM, U⊂MU\subset M, h:U→R nh : U\to \mathbf{R}^n (an atlas where UU-s make a basis of topology suffices). GL n(k)GL_n(k) acts on the right on 𝒰(M)\mathcal{U}(M) by
(p,(U,h))A:=(p,(U,A −1h)).
(p, (U, h)) A := (p, (U, A^{-1} h)).


Then ((p,(U,h))A)A′=(p,(U,h))(AA′)((p,(U,h))A)A' = (p,(U,h)) (AA') holds. The total space F *MF^* M of the coframe bundle by the definition, as a set, consists of classes of equivalence of tuples in 𝒰(M)\mathcal{U}(M) where (p,(U,h))∼(p′,(U′,h′))(p,(U,h)) \sim (p',(U',h')) iff p=p′p = p' and the Jacobian matrix of the transition between charts at h′(p)h'(p) is the unit matrix: J h′(p)(h∘(h′) −1)=IJ_{h'(p)}(h\circ (h')^{-1}) = I. The left action of GL n(k)GL_n(k) is induced on the quotient. There is an obvious projection π:[(p,(U,h)]↦p\pi: [(p,(U,h)]\mapsto p. To define the differential and principal bundle structure one charts F *M→MF^* M\to M with local trivializations from the neighborhoods of the form U×GL n(k)U\times GL_n(k), transfers the structure and checks that the transition functions are of the appropriate smoothness class and right GL n(k)GL_n(k)-equivariant. The basic prescription is that to every chart (U,h)(U,h) one defines a map
ϕ h=π −1(U)→U×GL n(k),z↦(π(z),J h(π(z))(h′∘h −1)),
\phi_{h} = \pi^{-1}(U)\to U \times GL_n(k),\,\,\,\,\,\,z\mapsto (\pi(z), J_{h(\pi(z))}(h'\circ h^{-1})),


where z=[(π(z),(U′,h′))]z = [(\pi(z), (U',h'))] with π(z)∈U′∩U\pi(z)\in U'\cap U. This does not depend on the choice of the chart (U′,h′)(U',h') around π(z)\pi(z). There is an equivariance
J h(π(zA))(h′∘h −1))=A −1J h(π(z))(h′∘h −1))
J_{h(\pi(z A))}(h'\circ h^{-1})) = A^{-1} J_{h(\pi(z))}(h'\circ h^{-1}))


and on intersection of (U,h)(U,h) and (V,g)(V,g)
J h(π(z))(h′∘h −1))=J g(π(z))(h′∘g −1)J h(π(z))(g∘h −1)
J_{h(\pi(z))}(h'\circ h^{-1})) = J_{g(\pi(z))}(h'\circ g^{-1})J_{h(\pi(z))}(g\circ h^{-1})


Then ϕ h\phi_h is onto and
(ϕ h∘(ϕ g) −1)(p,A)=(p,AJ h(p)(g∘h −1)
(\phi_h \circ (\phi_g)^{-1})(p,A) = (p, A J_{h(p)}(g\circ h^{-1})


what shows that the transition functions are smooth (where GL n(k)GL_n(k) has the standard differential structure).
In differential cohesion
In a context of differential cohesion, then the frame bundle (or higher order frame bundle) of a VV-manifold is the principal bundle (principal infinity-bundle) to which the infinitesimal disk bundle is the canonically associated bundle (associated infinity-bundle)
See at differential cohesion – Frame bundles.
The canonical differential 1-form
The frame bundle Fr(X)Fr(X) carries a canonical differential 1-form with values in ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.
α∈Ω 1(Fr(X),ℝ n)
  \alpha \in \Omega^1(Fr(X), \mathbb{R}^n)


This is defined as follows. Let p∈Fr(X)p \in Fr(X) be a point in the frame bundle π:Fr(X)→X\pi \colon Fr(X)\to X over some point x∈Xx \in X, hence a linear isomorphism p:T x≃ℝ np \colon T_x \simeq \mathbb{R}^n. For v∈T pFr(X)v \in T_p Fr(X) a tangent vector to the frame bundle, its projection π *v∈T xX\pi_\ast v \in T_x X is a tangent vector to XX. Then the value of α\alpha on vv is the image of this π *(v)\pi_\ast(v) under the isomorphism pp
α(v)≔p(π *(v)).
  \alpha(v) \coloneqq p(\pi_\ast(v))
  \,.


(Sternberg 64, section VII, (2.2))
Relation to GG-structures
A choice sub-bundle of a frame bundle which is a GG-principal bundle for G↪GL(n)G\hookrightarrow GL(n) defines a G-structure. See there for more.
A vector field is a section of a vector bundle.
More specifically, a vector field is a tangent vector field which is a section of a tangent bundle. Hence this is a function which picks a tangent vector at each point of a manifold, such that this assignment is suitably differentiable.
Equivalently this is a rank (1,0)(1,0)-tensor field on XX
As derivations of smooth functions
Vector fields may be identified with derivations on the algebra of smooth functions. See the article derivations of smooth functions are vector fields.
For XX a smooth manifold and TXT X its tangent bundle a multivector field on XX is an element of the exterior algebra bundle ∧ C ∞(X) •(Γ(TX))\wedge^\bullet_{C^\infty(X)}(\Gamma(T X)) of skew-symmetric tensor powers of sections of TXT X.


In degree 00 these are simply the smooth functions on XX.


In degree 11 these are simply the tangent vector fields on XX.


In degree pp these are sometimes called the pp-vector fields on XX.


Hochschild cohomology
In suitable contexts, multivector fields on XX can be identified with the Hochschild cohomology HH •(C(X),C(X))HH^\bullet(C(X), C(X)) of the algebra of functions on XX.
Schouten bracket
There is a canonical bilinear pairing on multivector fields called the Schouten bracket.
Isomorphisms with de Rham complex
Let XX be a smooth manifold of dimension dd, which is equipped with an orientation exhibited by a differential form ω∈Ω d(X)\omega \in \Omega^d(X).
Then contraction with ω\omega induces for all 0≤n≤d0 \leq n \leq d an isomorphism of vector spaces
ω(−):T poly n(X)→≃Ω (d−n)(X).
  \omega(-) : 
  T^n_{poly}(X)

The transport of the de Rham differential along these isomorphism equips T poly •T^\bullet_{poly} with the structure of a chain complex
Ω n(X) →d dR Ω n+1(X) ↓ ≃  ↓ ≃ T poly d−n →div ω T poly d−n−1,

The operation div ωdiv_\omega is a derivation of the Schouten bracket and makes multivectorfields into a BV-algebra.
A more general discussion of this phenomenon in (Cattaneo–Fiorenza–Longoni). Even more generally, see Poincaré duality for Hochschild cohomology.
Let XX by a differentiable manifold. The tangent Lie algebroid TXT X of XX is the Lie algebroid that corresponds – in the sense of Lie theory – to


the codiscrete groupoid X×XX \times X of XX.


the fundamental groupoid Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X) of XX.


When the tangent Lie algebroid is regarded as a Lie ∞-algebroid it corresponds to

the path ∞-groupoid Π ∞(X)\Pi_\infty(X).

The space of objects of TXT X is XX itself and its elements in degree 1 are the vectors on XX, i.e. the elements in the tangent bundle of XX. These are to be thouhght of as the infinitesimal paths in XX.
So to some extent the tangent Lie algebroid is the tangent bundle TXT X of XX. More precisely, when using the definition of a Lie algebroid EE over XX as a diagram
E  →ρ  TX  ↘  ↙   X
  \array{
    E &&\stackrel{\rho}{\to}&& T X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }


where ρ\rho is the map called the anchor map, the tangent Lie algebroid is that whose anchor map is the identity map
E=TX  →ρ=Id  TX  ↘  ↙   X.
  \array{
    E = T X &&\stackrel{\rho = Id}{\to}&& T X
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }
  \,.


Therefore the tangent Lie algebroid of XX is usually denoted TXT X, just as the tangent bundle itself.
The Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of TXT X is correspondingly fundamental: it is the deRham dg-algebra of differential forms on XX:
CE(TX)=(Ω •(X),d dR).
  CE(T X) = (\Omega^\bullet(X), d_{dR})
  \,.


So regarded as an NQ-supermanifold the tangent Lie algebroid is the shifted tangent bundle ΠTX\Pi T X equipped with its canonical odd vector field.
The de Rham complex (named after Georges de Rham) Ω •(X)\Omega^\bullet(X) of a space XX is the cochain complex that in degree nn has the differential forms (which may mean: Kähler differential forms) of degree nn, and whose differential is the de Rham differential or exterior derivative.
As XX varies this constitutes an abelian sheaf of complexes.
For smooth manifolds
The de Rham complex of a smooth manifold is the cochain complex which in degree n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} has the vector space Ω n(X)\Omega^n(X) of degree-nn differential forms on XX. The coboundary map is the deRham exterior derivative.
Explicitly, given a differential kk-form ω\omega, its de Rham differential dωd\omega can be computed as
dω(v 0,…,v k)=∑ i(−1) iℒ v iω(v 0,…,v i−1,v i+1,…,v k)+∑ i<j(−1) i+jω([v i,v j],v 0,…,v i−1,v i+1,…,v j−1,v j+1,…,v k),d\omega(v_0,\ldots,v_k)=\sum_i (-1)^i \mathcal{L}_{v_i} \omega(v_0,\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_k)+\sum_{i\lt j}(-1)^{i+j}\omega([v_i,v_j],v_0,\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_{j-1},v_{j+1},\ldots,v_k),
where v iv_i are vector fields on XX, [−,−][-,-] is the Lie bracket of vector fields, and ℒ v\mathcal{L}_{v} is the Lie derivative of a smooth function with respect to a vector field vv.
The cohomology of the de Rham complex (hence the quotient of closed differential forms by exact differential forms) is de Rham cohomology. Under the wedge product, the deRham complex becomes a differential graded algebra. This may be regarded as the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the tangent Lie algebroid TXT X of XX.
The corresponding abelian sheaf in this case defines a smooth spectrum via the stable Dold-Kan correspondence, see at smooth spectrum – Examples – De Rham spectra.
For algebraic objects
For smooth varieties XX, algebraic de Rham cohomology is defined to be the hypercohomology of the de Rham complex Ω X •\Omega_X^\bullet.
De Rham cohomology has a rather subtle generalization for possibly singular algebraic varieties due to (Grothendieck).
For analytic spaces

For cohesive homotopy types
In the general context of cohesive homotopy theory in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, for A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} a cohesive homotopy type, then the homotopy fiber of the counit of the flat modality
♭ dRA≔fib(♭A→A)
  \flat_{dR} A \coloneqq fib(\flat A \to A)


may be interpreted as the de Rham complex with coefficients in AA.
This is the codomain for the Maurer-Cartan form θ ΩA\theta_{\Omega A} on ΩA\Omega A in this generality. The shape of θ ΩA\theta_{\Omega A} is the general Chern character on Π(ΩA)\Pi(\Omega A).
For more on this see at

structures in a cohesive infinity-topos – de Rham cohomology

More precisely, ♭ dRΣA\flat_{dR} \Sigma A and Π dRΩA\Pi_{dR} \Omega A play the role of the non-negative degree and negative degree part, respectively of the de Rham complex with coefficients in Π♭ dRΣA\Pi \flat_{dR} \Sigma A. For more on this see at

Relation to PL de Rham complex

Proposition
(PL de Rham complex of smooth manifold is equivalent to de Rham complex)
Let XX be a smooth manifold.
We have the following zig-zag of dgc-algebra quasi-isomorphisms between the PL de Rham complex of (the topological space underlying) XX and the smooth de Rham complex of XX:
  Ω PLdR •(S(X))    Ω dR •(X)   i *↗  ↘ i poly   p *↙ Ω PLdR •(X)=Ω PLdR •(Sing(X))    Ω PSdR •(S(X))

Here S(X)S(X) is the simplicial complex corresponding to any smooth triangulation of XX.

Relation to Deligne complex
See at Deligne complex
The Dolbeault complex is the analog of the de Rham complex in complex geometry.
Dolbeault complex
On a complex manifold XX the de Rham complex Ω •(X)\Omega^\bullet(X) refines to a bigraded complex Ω •,•(X)\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(X), where a differential form of bidegree (p,q)(p,q) has holomorphic degree pp and antiholomorphic degree qq, hence is given on a local coordinate chart by an expression of the form
ω=∑f IJdz i 1∧⋯∧dz i p∧dz¯ j 1∧⋯∧dz¯ j q.
  \omega = \sum f_{I J} d z_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d z_{i_p} \wedge d \bar z_{j_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge d \bar z_{j_q}
 \,.


Moreover, the de Rham differential d\mathbf{d} decomposes as
d=∂+∂¯,
  \mathbf{d} = \partial + \bar \partial
  \,,


where ∂:Ω •,•→Ω •+1,•\partial \colon \Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}\to \Omega^{\bullet + 1, \bullet} and ∂¯:Ω •,•→Ω •,•+1\bar \partial \colon \Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}\to \Omega^{\bullet, \bullet + 1}.
The Dolbeault complex of XX is the chain complex (Ω •,•(X),∂¯)(\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(X), \bar \partial). The Dolbeault cohomology of XX is the cochain cohomology of this complex.
Holomorphic differential forms
Here Ω p,0(X)\Omega^{p,0}(X) defines a holomorphic vector bundle and a holomorphic section is a differential form with local expression as above, such that the coefficient functions f IJf_{I J} are holomorphic functions. This is called a holomorphic differential form.
For p<dim ℂ(X)p \lt dim_{\mathbb{C}}(X) equivalently this is a differential form in the kernel of the antiholomorphic Dolbeault operator ∂¯\bar \partial.
Dolbeault theorem
The complex analog of the de Rham theorem is the Dolbeault theorem:
for XX a complex manifold then its Dolbeault cohomology in bi-degree (p,q)(p,q) is naturally isomorphic to the abelian sheaf cohomology in degree qq of the abelian sheaf Ω p≔Ω p,0\Omega^p \coloneqq \Omega^{p,0} of holomorphic p-forms
H p,q(X)≃H q(X,Ω p).
  H^{p,q}(X)\simeq H^q(X,\Omega^p)
  \,.


(…)
Let Disk complDisk_{compl} be the category of complex polydiscs in ℂ n\mathbb{C}^n and holomorphic functions between them.
For p∈ℕp \in \mathbb{N} write Ω p:Disk complex op→Set\Omega^p \colon Disk_{complex}^{op} \to Set for the sheaf of holomorphic differential p-forms.

Proposition
For XX a complex manifold, let {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} be a holomorphic good open cover. Then the Cech cohomology of this cover with coefficients in Ω p\Omega^p in degree qq is the Dolbeault cohomology in bidegree (p,q)(p,q)
H p,q(X)≃π 0sPSh(Disk comp)(C({U i},Ω p[q])).
  H^{p,q}(X) \simeq \pi_0 sPSh(Disk_{comp})(C(\{U_i\}, \Omega^p[q]))
  \,.


For instance (Maddock, theorem 1.0.1).
On Stein manifolds

Proposition
(Cartan theorem B)
For XX a Stein manifold,
H k(Ω p,•(X),∂¯)={0 k≠0 Ω hol p(X) k=0.
  H^k(\Omega^{p,\bullet}(X), \bar \partial)
  =
  \left\{
    \array{  
      0 & k \neq 0 
      \\
      \Omega^p_{hol}(X) & k = 0
    }
  \right.
  \,.


For instance (Gunning-Rossi).

Proposition
For XX a Stein manifold of complex dimension nn, the compactly supported Dolbeault cohomology is
H k(Ω c p,•(X),∂¯)={0, k≠n (Ω hol n−p(X)) *,
  H^k(\Omega_c^{p, \bullet}(X), \bar \partial)
  = 
  \left\{
    \array{
      0 , & k \neq n
      \\
      (\Omega_{hol}^{n-p}(X))^\ast
    }
  \right.
  \,,


where on the right (−) *(-)^\ast denotes the continuous linear dual.

First noticed in (Serre).
Todd genus
By the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem the index of the Dolbeault operator is the Todd genus.
Relation to Spin cSpin^c-structures
A complex manifold, being in particular an almost complex manifold, carries a canonical spin^c structure. The corresponding Spin^c Dirac operator identifies with the Dolbeault operator under the identification of the spinor bundle with that of holomorphic differential forms
S(X)≃∧ 0,•T *X.
  S(X) \simeq \wedge^{0,\bullet} T^\ast X
  \,.


For f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y a smooth function between smooth manifold, and for ω∈Ω n(Y)\omega \in \Omega^n(Y) a differential n-form, there is the pullback nn-form f *ω∈Ω n(X)f^* \omega \in \Omega^n(X).
In terms of push-forward of vector fields
If differential forms are defined as linear duals to vectors then pullback is the dual operation to pushforward of a vector field?
f *ω(v 1,⋯,v n)=ω(f *v 1,⋯,f *v n).
  f^* \omega(v_1, \cdots, v_n) = \omega(f_* v_1, \cdots, f_* v_n)
  \,.


In terms of coordinate expression
Differential forms may be defined by Yoneda extension from differential forms on Cartesian spaces (see at geometry of physics – differential forms).
For X=ℝ k˜X = \mathbb{R}^{\tilde k} and Y=ℝ kY = \mathbb{R}^k Cartesian spaces and f:X⟶Yf \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y a smooth function between them, and on differential 1-forms
ω=∑ i=1 kω idx i
  \omega = \sum_{i = 1}^k \omega_i \mathbf{d}x^i


the pullback operation f *f^\ast is given by
f *dx i≔∑ j=1 k˜∂f i∂x˜ jdx˜ j
  f^* \mathbf{d}x^i
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \sum_{j = 1}^{\tilde k} \frac{\partial f^i}{\partial \tilde x^j} \mathbf{d}\tilde x^j


and hence
f *ω=f *(∑ iω idx i)≔∑ i=1 k(f *ω) i∑ j=1 k˜∂f i∂x˜ jdx˜ j,
  f^* \omega = f^* \left( \sum_{i} \omega_i \mathbf{d}x^i \right)
  \coloneqq
  \sum_{i = 1}^k \left(f^* \omega\right)_i \sum_{j = 1}^{\tilde k} \frac{\partial f^i }{\partial \tilde x^j}  \mathbf{d} \tilde x^j 
  \,,


where


f *ω if^* \omega_i is the pullback of functions defined by
(f *ω i)(x)=ω i(f(x))∀x∈X
  (f^* \omega_i)(x) = \omega_i(f(x)) \;\;\;\forall x \in X



the function
∂f i∂x˜ j:ℝ k˜→ℝ
  \frac{\partial f^i}{\partial \tilde x^j} \colon \mathbb{R}^{\tilde k} \to \mathbb{R}


is the partial derivative of the kk-th coordinate component of ff along the jjthe coordinate.


Compatibility with the de Rham differential

Proposition
(compatiblity with the de Rham differential)
Pullback of differential forms commutes with the de Rham differential:
f *∘d Y=d X∘f *.
  f^* \circ \mathbf{d}_Y = \mathbf{d}_X \circ f^*
  \,.


Hence it constitutes a chain map between the de Rham complexes
f *:Ω •(Y)→Ω •(X).
  f^* \colon \Omega^\bullet(Y) \to \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \,.


Sheaf of differential forms
Under pullback differential forms form a presheaf on the catories CartSp and SmthMfd, in fact a sheaf with respect to the standard open cover-coverage.
Invariant differential form
A differential form ω∈Ω dR p(G)\omega \in \Omega_{dR}^p(G) on a Lie group GG is called left invariant if for every g∈Gg \in G it is invariant under the pullback of differential forms
(1)(L g) *ω=ω
  
  (L_g)^* \omega = \omega


along the left multiplication action
L g: G ⟶ G  x ↦ g⋅x
  \array{
    L_g \colon & G &\longrightarrow& G
    \\
    & x &\mapsto& g \cdot x
  }


Analogously a form is right invariant if it is invariant under the pullback by right translations R gR_g.
More generally, given a differentiable (e.g. smooth) group action of GG on a differentiable (e.g. smooth) manifold MM
G×M ⟶ρ M (g,x) ↦ g⋅x
  \array{
    G \times M 
    &
      \overset{\rho}{\longrightarrow}
    &
    M
    \\
    (g,x) &\mapsto& g \cdot x
  }


then a differential form ω∈Ω dR p(M)\omega \in \Omega^p_{dR}(M) is called invariant if for all g∈Gg \in G
ρ(g) *(ω)=ω.
  \rho(g)^\ast(\omega) \;=\; \omega
  \,.


This reduces to the left invariance (1) for M=GM = G and ρ\rho being the left multiplication action of GG on itself.
Invariant vector field
For a vector field XX one instead typically defines the invariance via the pushforward (TL g)X=(L g) *X(T L_g) X = (L_g)_* X. Regarding that L gL_g and T gT_g are diffeomorphisms, both pullbacks and pushfowards (hence invariance as well) are defined for every tensor field; and the two requirements are equivalent.
Curvature
The Maurer-Cartan form is a Lie-algebra valued form with vanishing curvature.
dθ+12[θ∧θ]=0
  d \theta + \frac{1}{2}[\theta \wedge \theta] = 0


This is known as the Maurer-Cartan equation.
Synthetically this is just a restatement of the fact that for x,y∈Gx,y \in G there is a unique group element such that y=x⋅gy = x \cdot g: therefore for three points x,y,zx,y,z we have
  y   θ(x,y)↗  ↘ θ(y,z) x  →θ(x,z)  z
  \array{
    && y
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\theta}(x,y)}\nearrow && \searrow^{\mathrlap{\theta}(y,z)}
    \\
    x &&\stackrel{\theta(x,z)}{\to}&& z
  }


i.e. θ(x,y)θ(y,z)=θ(x,z)\theta(x,y) \theta(y,z) = \theta(x,z). This is what analytically becomes the statement of vanishing curvature.
Pullback
If XX is a smooth manifold and h:X→Gh : X \to G a smooth function with values in GG, we have the pullback form
h *θ∈Ω 1(X,𝔤)
  h^* \theta \in \Omega^1(X,\mathfrak{g})


of the Maurer-Cartan form on XX. Using the above notation, writing simply h −1h^{-1} for h * −1h^{-1}_* this is
h *θ=h −1dh.
  h^* \theta = h^{-1} d h
 \,.


Now dh:TX→TGd h : T X \to T G is no longer (necessarily) the identity map as gg was when we wrote θ=g −1dg\theta = g^{-1} d g above, but the form of this equation shows why it can be useful to think of θ\theta itself in terms of the identity map dg:TG→TGd g : T G \to T G.
Gauge transformations
The Maurer-Cartan form crucially appears in the formula for the gauge transformation of Lie-algebra valued 1-forms.
For u:ℝ→Gu : \mathbb{R} \to G a smooth function and A∈Ω 1(ℝ,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(\mathbb{R}, \mathfrak{g}) a Lie-algebra valued form, the condition that uu is flat with respect to AA is that it satisfies the differential equation
du=−(R u) *∘A
  d u = -(R_u)_* \circ A


(where RR denotes the right multiplication action of GG on itself). This is such that if GG happens to be a matrix Lie group it is equivalent to
(d+A)u=0.
  (d + A) u = 0
  \,.


We call the unique solution uu  of this differential equation that satisfies u(0)=eu(0) = e the parallel transport of AA and write it u=Pexp(∫ 0 (−)A)u = P \exp(\int_0^{(-)} A).
Now for g:ℝ→Gg : \mathbb{R} \to G a function, the gauge transformed parallel transport is
g −1Pexp(∫ 0 (−)A)g.
  g^{-1} P \exp(\int_0^{(-)} A) g
  \,.


This solves a differential equation as above, but for a different 1-form A′A'. The relation is
A′=Ad g −1A+g *θ
  A' = Ad_{g^{-1}} A + g^* \theta


or equivalently, with adopted notation
A′=g −1Ag+g −1dg.
  A' = g^{-1}A g + g^{-1} d g
  \,.


There are two different meanings of horizontal differential form
Given a bundle π:P→X\pi \colon P \to X of smooth manifolds,


then a differential form on the total space PP is horizontal if it vanishes on vertical vector fields:


in the context of variational calculus:
a differential form on the the total space J X ∞(E)J^\infty_X(E) of the jet bundle of EE is horizontal if it is in the horizontal component of the variational bicomplex of J ∞(E)J^\infty(E).


A cogerm differential form is a vast generalization of the usual exterior differential forms, which includes also absolute differential forms, as well as “higher” differential forms such as d 2xd^2x and a commutative differential operator (at least in the case of 1-forms).
Let XX be a set. Usually, XX will be a manifold or a generalized smooth space, but the definition does not require this.
By a curve in XX we mean a function c:(−ϵ,ϵ)→Xc:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to X for some real number ϵ>0\epsilon\gt 0. Two curves c:(−ϵ,ϵ)→Xc:(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\to X and c′:(−ϵ′,ϵ′)→Xc':(-\epsilon',\epsilon')\to X have the same germ (at 0) if there exists ϵ″≤min(ϵ,ϵ′)\epsilon'' \le min(\epsilon,\epsilon') such that cc and c′c' agree when restricted to (−ϵ″,ϵ″)(-\epsilon'',\epsilon''). Let CXC X denote the set of germs of curves in XX, i.e. the quotient of the set of curves in XX by the equivalence relation “has the same germ as”.

Definition
A (partial) cogerm differential 1-form on XX is a partial function ω:CX→ℝ\omega : C X \to \mathbb{R}. We write the action of ω\omega on a curve cc (or germ thereof) as ⟨ω|c⟩\langle \omega | c \rangle.

Here we discuss the integration of a differential form (possibly twisted in some way) on a topological manifold (possibly with additional structure) over an appropriately structured submanifold (or formal linear combination thereof).


Stokes theorem


kernel of integration is the exact differential forms



Definition
A smooth function f:X→Yf : X \to Y between two smooth manifolds is a local diffeomorphism if the following equivalent conditions hold


ff is both a submersion and an immersion;


for each point x∈Xx \in X the derivative df:T xX→T f(x)Yd f : T_x X \to T_{f(x)} Y is an isomorphism of tangent vector spaces;


the canonical diagram
TX →df TY ↓  ↓ X →f Y
  \array{
     T X &\stackrel{d f}{\to}& T Y
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  }


(with the differential between the tangent bundles) on top is a pullback;


for each point x∈Xx \in X there exists an open subset x∈U⊂Xx \in U \subset X such that


the image f(U)f(U) is an open subset in YY;


ff restricted to UU is a diffeomorphism onto its image
f| U:U→≃f(U)
  f|_U : U \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}  f(U)






The equivalence of the conditions on tangent space with the conditions on open subsets follows by the inverse function theorem.

Remark
An analogous characterization of étale morphisms between affine algebraic varieties is given by tangent cones. See there.

General

A local diffeomorphism is a local homeomorphism and so also an open map. By the inverse function theorem.

Abstract characterization
The category SmoothMfd of smooth manifolds may naturally be thought of as sitting inside the more general context of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids. This is canonically equipped with a notion of differential cohesion exhibited by its inclusion into SynthDiff∞Grpd. This implies that there is an intrinsic notion of formally étale morphisms of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids in general and of smooth manifolds in particular

Proposition
A smooth function is a formally étale morphism in this sense precisely if it is a local diffeomorphism.

See this section for more details.
Let XX and YY be two smooth manifolds of finite dimension and let f:X→Yf : X \to Y be a differentiable function between them
In components, the definition of submersion reads as follows.

Definition
The function f:X→Yf : X \to Y is called a submersion precisely if its differential df:TX→TYd f\colon T X \to T Y is for every point x∈Xx \in X a surjection df x:T xX→T f(x)Yd f_x\colon T_x X \to T_{f(x)} Y; hence if all points in its image are regular values.

More abstractly formulated, this means equivalently the following.

Definition
The function f:X→Yf : X \to Y is a submersion precisely if the canonical morphism
TX→X× YTY≕f *TY
  T X \to X \times_Y T Y \eqqcolon f^* T Y


from the tangent bundle of XX to the pullback of the tangent bundle of YY along ff is a surjection.

This morphism is the one induced by the universal property of the pullback from the commuting diagram
TX →df TY ↓  ↓ X →f Y.
  \array{
    T X &\stackrel{d f}{\to}& T Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{f}{\to}& Y
  }
  \,.


In terms of coordinates, the map ff is a submersion at a point p:Xp\colon X if and only if there exists a coordinate chart on XX near pp and a coordinate chart on YY near f(p)f(p) relative to which ff is the projection f(x 1,…,x n)=(x 1,…,x m)f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = (x_1,\ldots,x_m). This definition applies to infinite-dimensional manifolds, to non-differentiable maps, even between non-differentiable manifolds.
Pullbacks
While the category Diff of (finite dimensional) smooth manifolds does not have all pullbacks, the pullback along a submersion always exists. This is because a submersion is transversal to every other smooth map into its codomain. Moreover, submersions are stable under pullback.
Epimorphisms and coverings
The surjective submersions (that is the submersions that are also epimorphisms in Diff) are regular epimorphisms.
Surjective submersions form a singleton Grothendieck pretopology on Diff, and so may be used in internal category theory when using DiffDiff as the ambient category. They appear notably in the definition of Lie groupoids.
Ehresmann's theorem states that a proper submersion is a locally trivial fibration.
Normal form
For f:X→Yf : X \to Y a submersion, then around every point of XX there is an open neighbourhood on which ff restricts to a projection.
Characterization in infinitesimal cohesion
A smooth function f:X→Yf : X \to Y between smooth manifolds is canonically regarded as a morphism in the cohesive (∞,1)-topos SynthDiff∞Grpd. With respect to the canonical infinitesimal neighbourhood inclusion i:i :  Smooth∞Grpd ↪\hookrightarrow SynthDiff∞Grpd there is a notion of formally smooth morphism in SynthDiff∞GrpdSynthDiff\infty Grpd.
ff is a submersion precisely if it is formally smooth with respect to this infinitesimal cohesion.
See the discussion at SynthDiff∞Grpd for details.
A space XX is called formally smooth if every morphism Y→XY \to X into it has all possible infinitesimal extensions.
(If there is at most one extension per infinitesimal extension of YY with no guarantee of existence it is called a formally unramified morphism. If the thickenings exist uniquely, it is called a formally etale morphism).
Traditionally this has considered in the context of geometry over formal duals of rings and associative algebras. This we discuss in the section (Concrete notion). But generally the notion makes sense in any context of infinitesimal cohesion. This we discuss in the section General abstract notion.
A space XX is called formally unramified if every morphism Y→XY \to X into it has for every infinitesimal thickening of YY at most one infinitesimal extension.
(If all thickenings exist it is called a formally smooth morphism. If the thickening exist uniquely, it is called a formally etale morphism.)
Traditionally this has been considered in the context of geometry over formal duals of rings and associative algebras. This we discuss in the section (Concrete notion). But generally the notion makes sense in any context of infinitesimal cohesion. This we discuss in the section General abstract notion.
The concept of formally unramified morphisms is the infinitesimal version of that of unramified morphisms.
In a context of synthetic differential geometry or D-geometry, the de Rham space dR(X)dR(X) of a space XX is the quotient of XX that identifies infinitesimally close points.
It is the coreduced reflection of XX.
On Rings opRings^{op}
Let CRing be the category of commutative rings. For R∈CRingR \in CRing, write I∈RI \in R for the nilradical of RR, the ideal consisting of the nilpotent elements. The canonical projection R→R/IR \to R/I to the quotient by the ideal corresponds in the opposite category Ring opRing^{op} to the inclusion
Spec(R/I)→SpecR
  Spec (R/I) \to Spec R


of the reduced part of SpecRSpec R.

Definition
For X∈PSh(Ring op)X \in PSh(Ring^{op}) a presheaf on Ring opRing^{op} (for instance a scheme), its de Rham space X dRX_{dR} is the presheaf defined by
X dR:SpecR↦X(Spec(R/I)).
  X_{dR} : Spec R \mapsto X\left(Spec \left(R/I\right)\right)
  \,.


As a quotient

Proposition
If X∈PSh(Ring op)X \in PSh(Ring^{op}) is a smooth scheme then the canonical morphism
X→X dR
  X \to X_{dR}


is an epimorphism (hence an epimorphism over each SpecRSpec R) and therefore in this case X dRX_{dR} is the quotient of the relation “being infinitesimally close” between points of XX: we have that X dRX_{dR} is the coequalizer
X dR=lim →(X inf⟶⟶X),
  X_{dR} = \lim_\to 
   \left(
     X^{inf} \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} X
   \right)
  \,,


of the two projections out of the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal.

Relation to jet bundles
For E→XE \to X a bundle over XX, its direct image under base change along the projection map X⟶Π infXX \longrightarrow \Pi_{inf} X yields its jet bundle. See there for more.

Remark
In terms of differential homotopy type theory this means that forming “jet types” of dependent types over XX is the dependent product operation along the unit of the infinitesimal shape modality
jet(E)≔∏X→Π infXE.
  jet(E) \coloneqq \underset{X \to \Pi_{inf}X}{\prod} E
  \,.


Relation to formally étale morphisms of schemes

formally étale morphism of schemes

In solid state physics a crystal is a bound state of atomic nuclei and electrons (much as atoms and molecules are, too, but) in which the nuclei occupy a discrete “regular lattice” which is invariant – as a discrete subset of Euclidean space and as far as the crystal extends – under a discrete subgroup of the Euclidean group of translations, reflections and rotations.
These subgroups are also known as crystallographic groups and are used to classify crytalline structures.
In addition to these spatial symmetries, the dynamics of the electrons in a crystalline material may also have internal symmetries and/or CPT-symmetries (like time-reversal symmetry) which together with the crystallographic symmetry affect the physical properties of the crystalline material, for instance whether it behaves like a conductor/semi-conductor/insulator with respect to electric currents or whether it admits topological phases of matter which are “protected” by these symmetries.
In a context of differential cohesion, with infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im, then for every object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} its infinitesimal disk bundle T infXT_{inf}X is the homotopy fiber product
T infX ⟶ev X ↓ p  ↓ X ⟶i ℑ(X)
  \array{
    T_{inf} X &\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& \Im(X)
  }


of the XX component i:X→ℑXi \colon X \to \Im X of the unit of the ℑ\Im-monad with itself.
By the pasting law, the fibers of p:T infX→Xp \colon T_{inf}X \to X over global points of XX are indeed the infinitesimal disks around these points.
Evidently T infXT_{inf}X is the first stage in the Cech nerve of X→ℑ(X)X \to \Im(X), hence the object of morphisms of the groupoid object corresponding to this effective epimorphism. By the discussion at Lie algebroid – General abstract definition this is an infinity-Lie algebroid, namely the (possibly higher jet order) tangent Lie algebroid of XX.
More generally, for (E→X)∈H /X(E \to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{/X} a bundle over XX, then T infE≔T infX× ℑXE≃X× ℑXET_{inf}E \coloneqq T_{inf} X \times_{\Im X} E \simeq X\times_{\Im X} E, sitting in the pasting composite of pullbacks
T infE ⟶ E ↓  ↓ T infX ⟶ev X ↓ p  ↓ X ⟶i ℑ(X).
  \array{
    T_{inf} E &\longrightarrow& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    T_{inf} X &\stackrel{ev}{\longrightarrow}& X
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}& \Im(X)
  }
  \,.


Stated more abstractly, this means that forming infinitesimal disk bundles is the monad
T infX× X(−)=i *i !
  T_{inf} X \times_X (-)
  =
  i^\ast i_!


induced by the adjoint triple of base change along ii
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):H /X⟶i *⟵i *⟶i !H /ℑX.
  (i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im X}
  \,.


Relation to the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal
In the standard models of differential cohesion (such as for formal smooth infinity-groupoids), ℑX\Im X is the standard de Rham stack of XX obtained by identifying infinitesimal neighbours, and so then T infXT_{\inf }X is the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal of XX, in the traditional sense. Indeed, in these standard models X→ℑXX \to \Im X is a 1-epimorphism, hence effective, and so on 0-truncated XX the above pullback equivalently equibits the de Rham stack ℑX\Im X for 0-truncated XX as the coequalizer of the two projections out of the formal neighbourhood of the diagoal, which is the traditional definition of ℑX\Im X.
Relation to tangent complexes
The tangent complex of a derived algebraic stack XX is equivalently the (sheaf of modules of) sections of the formal neighbourhood of the diagonal of XX (Hennion 13). Hence by the above one may generally think of (sections of) T infXT_{inf}X as being the tangent complex of XX.
Relation to jet bundles
The infinitesimal disk bundle construction is left adjoint to the jet comonad
T inf⊣Jet.
  T_{inf} \dashv Jet
  \,.


In the context of synthetic differential geometry this is (Kock 80, prop. 2.2). In terms of differential cohesion this is simply the adjoint pair induced by the base change adjoint triple
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):H /X⟶i *⟵i *⟶i !H /ℑX.
  (i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
    \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^\ast}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{i_\ast}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im X}
  \,.


Relation to frame bundles
For XX a VV-manifold, then its infinitesimal disk bundle is a fiber bundle (fiber infinity-bundle) with typical fiber ≃𝔻 e V\simeq \mathbb{D}^V_e. This is the associated bundle (associated infinity-bundle) to the frame bundle Fr(X)→XFr(X) \to X (or more generally of the higher order frame bundle when (ℜ⊣ℑ)(\Re \dashv \Im) encodes higher order infinitesimal thickening).
See at differential cohesion – frame bundles.
The smooth Serre-Swan theorem (Nestruev 03, 11.33) states that over a smooth manifold XX,


the section functor
Γ X(−):SmoothVectorBundles /X↪C ∞(X)Mod
  \Gamma_X(-)
   \;\colon\;
  SmoothVectorBundles_{/X} 
    \hookrightarrow
  C^\infty(X) Mod


that sends smooth vector bundles (with fibers of uniformly bounded dimension) over XX of finite rank to their spaces of smooth sections, regarded as modules over the algebra of smooth functions on XX, is a fully faithful functor
(Nestruev 03, theorem 11.29);


its essential image consists precisely of the finitely generated projective modules
(Nestruev 03, 11.32).


This is the variant for differential geometry of what the Serre-Swan theorem asserts in algebraic geometry and in topology.

Remark
(base smooth manifold not required to be compact)
Contrary to the original theorem of Swan 62 for topological vector bundles, here in the smooth case the base smooth manifold XX of the smooth vector bundle is not required to be compact. While for topological spaces compactness is needed to deduce that every topological vector bundle is a direct summand of a trivial vector bundle (this prop.) for smooth vector bundles this conclusion follows without assuming compactness, by embedding of smooth manifolds into Cartesian spaces (this prop.).


Remark
(other algebraic apects of differential geometry)
Together with the embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras, the smooth Serre-Swan theorem states that that differential geometry is “more algebraic” than it may superficially seem. A third fact in this vein is that derivations of smooth functions are vector fields.

On a smooth manifold XX the smooth tangent vector fields v∈Γ X(TX)v \in \Gamma_X(T X) are geometrically defined as smoothly varying collections of smooth paths γ x:ℝ 1→X\gamma_x \colon \mathbb{R}^1 \to X through every point x∈Xx \in X (i.e. γ(0)=x\gamma(0) = x), with two such paths regarded as equivalent if their first derivative v x∈T xXv_x \in T_x X at xx, seen in any chart, coincides.
By pre-composing a smooth function f:X⟶ℝ 1f \colon  X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1 with such a path, we obtain a function f∘γ x:ℝ 1→ℝ 1f\circ \gamma_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^1 \to \mathbb{R}^1 from the real line to itself. Therefore its derivative
(D vf)(x)≔d(f∘γ) 0
  (D_v f)(x) \coloneqq  d (f \circ \gamma)_0


may be identified with a real number (measuring the rate of change of ff along γ\gamma at xx to first order). Since γ x\gamma_x, or rather its derivative v x∈T xXv_x \in T_x X, is assumed to depend smoothly on xx, this defines a new smooth function
D vf:X⟶ℝ 1.
  D_v f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^1
  \,.


Due to the product rule of differentiation, this assignment f↦D vff \mapsto D_v f is such that for f,g∈C ∞(X)f,g \in C^\infty(X) two smooth functions, with pointwise product function f⋅gf \cdot g then
D v(f⋅g)=D v(f)⋅g+f⋅D v(g).
  D_v(f \cdot g)
  \;=\;
  D_v(f) \cdot g + f \cdot D_v(g)
  \,.


This means that D v:C ∞(X)→C ∞(X)D_v \;\colon\; C^\infty(X) \to C^\infty(X) is a derivation on the algebra of smooth functions.
Remarkably, all derivations on C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) arise this way, and for a unique vector field v∈Γ X(TX)v \in \Gamma_X(T X):
{derivations on algebra of smooth functions onX}≃{smooth tangent vector fields onX}
  \left\{
    \array{
      \text{derivations on}
      \\
      \text{algebra of smooth functions}
      \\
      \text{on}\, X
    }
  \right\}
  \;\simeq\;
  \left\{
     \array{
        \text{smooth}
        \\
        \text{tangent vector fields}
        \\
        \text{on}\, X
     }
  \right\}


This is prop.  below. What makes this work is the Hadamard lemma, see the proof below for details.
Notice that the concept of derivations is purely a concept of algebra, with no input from the topology and differential geometry that goes into the definition and construction of smooth manifolds and their tangent bundles. Therefore the identification of smooth vector fields with derivations is an algebraic incarnation of an aspect of differential geometry, an identification comparable two two other such phenomena:


the embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras – which identifies smooth manifolds themselves with the formal dual of their real algebras of smooth functions;


the smooth Serre-Swan theorem which identifies smooth vector bundles over a smooth manifold with the projective modules of the algebra of smooth functions.


These statements mean that differential geometry has more in common with algebraic geometry than is manifest from the traditional definitions. This serves as the bases for the definition of formal smooth manifolds and the theory of synthetic differential geometry. For more exposition of this relation see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Beware however that related algebraic properties familiar from affine schemes may break in differential geometry: For the Kähler differential forms of C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) to come out as the expected smooth differential forms one needs to refine the plain ℝ\mathbb{R}-commutative algebra C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) to the structure of a smooth algebra. See at Kähler differential forms for discussion of this issue.
The Hadamard lemma says that the Taylor series of a smooth function on the real line around the origin has a remainder at order nn which is the product of x n+1x^{n+1} (for xx the canonical coordinate function) with another smooth function.
Simple as this may sound, it has profound consequences, as it means that smooth functions behave more like polynomials than the classical definition might suggest. For instance the Hadamard lemma directly implies that:


derivations of smooth functions are vector fields: For XX a smooth manifold and C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) its ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra of smooth functions (under pointwise multiplication), then there is a natural bijection between the smooth tangent vector fields on XX and the purely algebraic derivations of the algebra C ∞(X)C^\infty(X);


the smooth infinitesimally thickened point 𝔻\mathbb{D} is the same as in algebraic geometry: The quotient of the algebra of smooth functions C ∞(ℝ 1)C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^1) on the real line by the ideal generated by the square x 2x^2 of the canonical coordinate function xx is the ring of dual numbers:
C ∞(ℝ)/(x 2)≃(ℝ⊕ϵℝ)/(ϵ 2).
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R})/(x^2) \simeq (\mathbb{R} \oplus \epsilon \mathbb{R})/(\epsilon^2)
  \,.



together this implies that a tangent vector in a smooth manifold XX is equivalently a morphism of the form
𝔻⟶X
  \mathbb{D} \longrightarrow X


of formal duals of ℝ\mathbb{R}-alghebras, from the infinitesimally thickened point 𝔻\mathbb{D}.


This means that differential geometry has more in common with algebraic geometry than is manifest from the traditional definitions. In synthetic differential geometry one makes use of these facts to find a useful unified perspective. For exposition of this point see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
More generally one may ask for other types of function algebras which satisfy the conclusion of the Hadamard lemma. These turn out to be the algebras over those algebraic theories which are called Fermat theories. These are hence a crucial ingredient for well-adapted models of synthetic differential geometry.
Borel's Theorem (also called Borel's Lemma) says that every power series is the Taylor series of some smooth function. In other words: for every collection of prescribed partial derivatives at some point, there is a smooth function having these as its actual derivatives.
In considering certain types of generalized smooth spaces, one may try to describe the smooth structure on a space by specifying the smooth curves. Boman's Theorem shows that this is sufficient to describe the smooth structure on a smooth manifold.
A statement about sufficient data for extensions of a smooth function from a compact subset to an open neighbourhood.
The Steenrod-approximation theorem states mild conditions under which an extension of a smooth function on a closed subset by a continuous function may itself be improved to an extension by a smooth function.
This is a smooth enhancement of the Tietze extension theorem.
The (strong) Whitney embedding theorem states that every smooth manifold (Hausdorff and sigma-compact) of dimension nn has an embedding of smooth manifolds in the Euclidean space of dimension 2n2n.
Notice that it is easy to see that every smooth manifold embeds into the Euclidean space of some dimension (this prop.). The force of Whitney’s strong embedding theorem is to find the lowest dimension that still works in general.
The Poincaré Lemma in differential geometry and complex analytic geometry asserts that “every differential form ω\omega which is closed, d dRω=0d_{dR}\omega = 0, is locally exact, ω| U=d dRκ\omega|_U = d_{dR}\kappa.”
In more detail: if XX is contractible then for every closed differential form ω∈Ω cl k(X)\omega \in \Omega^k_{cl}(X) with k≥1k \geq 1 there exists a differential form λ∈Ω k−1(X)\lambda \in \Omega^{k-1}(X) such that
ω=d dRλ.
  \omega 
  \,=\, 
  d_{dR} \lambda
  \,.


Moreover, for ω\omega a smooth family of closed forms, there is a smooth family of λ\lambdas satisfying this condition.
This statement has several more abstract incarnations. One is that it says that on a Cartesian space (or a complex polydisc) the de Rham cohomology (the holomorphic de Rham cohomology) vanishes in positive degree.
Still more abstractly this says that the canonical morphisms of sheaves of chain complexes
ℝ→Ω dR •
  \mathbb{R} \to \Omega^\bullet_{dR}


ℂ→Ω hol •
  \mathbb{C} \to \Omega^\bullet_{hol}


from the locally constant sheaf on the real numbers (the complex numbers) to the de Rham complex (holomorphic de Rham complex) is a stalk-wise quasi-isomorphism – hence an equivalence in the derived category and hence induce an equivalence in hyper-abelian sheaf cohomology. (The latter statement fails in general in complex algebraic geometry, see (Illusie 12, 1.) and see also at GAGA.) (A variant of such resolutions of constant sheaves for the case over Klein geometries are BGG resolutions.)
The Poincaré lemma is a special case of the more general statement that the pullbacks of differential forms along homotopic smooth function are related by a chain homotopy.
The Stokes theorem (also Stokes' theorem or Stokes's theorem) asserts that the integral of an exterior differential form on the boundary of an oriented manifold with boundary (or submanifold or chain of such) equals the integral of the de Rham differential of the form on the manifold itself. (The theorem also applies to exterior pseudoforms on a chain of pseudoriented submanifolds.)
On cohomology
The de Rham theorem (named after Georges de Rham) asserts that the de Rham cohomology H dR n(X)H^n_{dR}(X) of a smooth manifold XX (without boundary) is isomorphic to the real cohomology H n(X,ℝ)H^n(X, \mathbb{R}), hence its ordinary cohomology with real number coefficients, as computed for instance by the singular or Čech cohomology with real coefficients.
The theorem has several dozens of different proofs. For example in the Čech approach one can make a double complex whose first row is the Čech complex of a covering and first column is the de Rham complex and other entries are mixed and use spectral sequence argument (see the textbook of Bott and Tu, or the geometry lectures book by Postnikov, semester III).
This is maybe best formulated, understood and proven in the context of abelian sheaf cohomology:
Write ℝ c\mathbb{R}_c for


the abelian group ℝ\mathbb{R}


regarded not as a Lie group with the standard manifold structure on ℝ\mathbb{R} but as a topologically discrete group on the underlying set of ℝ\mathbb{R}


and then regarded as a sheaf on XX: the constant sheaf that sends connected U⊂XU \subset X to the set of constant maps U→ℝU \to \mathbb{R}.


Write B nℝ c\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c for the corresponding Eilenberg-MacLane object in chain complexes of sheaves of abelian groups: this is the complex of sheaves with ℝ c\mathbb{R}_c in degree nn:
B nℝ c=(⋯→0→ℝ c→0→⋯→0).
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c
  = 
  (\cdots \to 0 \to \mathbb{R}_c \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0) 
  \,.


Next, write B¯ nℝ\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R} (without the subscript cc!) for the Deligne complex for ℝ\mathbb{R}
B¯ nℝ=(C ∞(−,ℝ)→d dRΩ 1(−)→d dRΩ 2(−)→d dR⋯→d dRΩ closed n(−)).
  \bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}
  = 
  (C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^1(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to}
    \Omega^2(-) \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \cdots \stackrel{d_{dR}}{\to} \Omega^n_{closed}(-)) 
  \,.


(The notation here is borrowed from that used at motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks: we can think of B¯ nℝ\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R} as a differential refinement of the object B nℝ c\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c).
Then we have:


“ordinary” ℝ\mathbb{R}-valued cohomology of XX is the abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in B nℝ c\mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c.


de Rham cohomology of XX is the abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in B¯ nℝ\bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R} (this is semi-obvious, requires a bit more discussion).


the Poincare lemma says that every closed differential form is locally exact, and hence there is a quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes of sheaves
B nℝ c→≃B¯ nℝ
  \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}_c \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \bar \mathbf{B}^n \mathbb{R}


given by injecting for each U⊂XU \subset X the set ℝ\mathbb{R} as the constant functions into C ∞(U,ℝ)C^\infty(U,\mathbb{R}).


It is this quasi-isomorphism of coefficient objects that induces the de Rham isomorphism of abelian sheaf cohomology groups, which is ordinarily written as
H n(X,ℝ)≃H dR n(X).
  H^n(X,\mathbb{R}) \simeq 
  H^n_{dR}(X)
  \,.


…
On cochains
The equivalence on cohomology asserted by the de Rham theorem is but a decategorification of a more refined statement: a quasi-isomorphism of cochain complexes. This even respects the product structure:
for XX a smooth manifold there is an equivalence of A-infinity algebras
(Ω •(X),d dR)→≃(C(X),∪)
  (\Omega^\bullet(X), d_{dR})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  (C(X), \cup)


between the de Rham complex and the collection of singular cochains equipped with the cup product.
This is due to (Gugenheim, 1977).
Furthermore, the E-infinity algebra structure on differential forms (trivially induced by the commutative dga? structure) and singular cochains (as witnessed by the action of the sequence operad of McClure and Smith on singular cochains) is also preserved.
Synthetic version
The de Rham theorem also holds internally in the context of suitable smooth toposes 𝒯\mathcal{T} modelling the axioms of synthetic differential geometry.
Specifically


the internal singular chain complex in 𝒯\mathcal{T} is given as the RR-linear dual of the free internal RR-module on the internal hom objects [Δ n,X][\Delta^n,X], where RR is the internal incarnation of the real numbers;


the de Rham complex is given by differential forms in synthetic differential geometry.


The de Rham theorem in 𝒯\mathcal{T} then asserts that for XX a manifold regarded as an object in the well-adapted smooth topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} the morphism
∫:H p(X)→H p(X,R) *
  \int : H^p(X) \to H_p(X,R)^*


in 𝒯\mathcal{T} is an isomorphism for all p∈ℕp \in \mathbb{N}. This implies the standard (external) de Rham theorem.
This is discussed in chapter IV of

Ieke Moerdijk, Gonzalo Reyes, Models for Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis for the toposes 𝒯=𝒢,ℱ\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{F} (see models).

A little bit a long these lines for diffeological spaces is also in

Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour, De Rham calculus (pdf)

The Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem identifies the Hochschild homology and cohomology of certain algebras with their modules of Kähler differentials and derivations, respectively.
In abstract generality, a differential cohomology diagram is the hexagonal diagram in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos formed by the two fracture squares of the unit and counit of, respectively, the shape modality Π\Pi and the flat modality ♭\flat. The exactness properties of this diagram for any stable homotopy type E^\hat E in the corresponding tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos express E^\hat E as being the coefficients for a differential cohomology refinement by differential form data ♭ dRE^\flat_{dR} \hat E of the generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory which is represented by the shape spectrum E≔Π(E^)E \coloneqq \Pi(\hat E).
Historically, it had been shown in (Simons-Sullivan 07) for ordinary differential cohomology and in (Freed-Lott 10, Simons-Sullivan 08) for differential K-theory that these cohomology theories are characterized as sitting in the middle of a hexagonal diagram of interlocking exact sequences of cohomology groups, which expresses, on the one hand, how every differential cohomology class has underlying it a non-differential cohomology class (“of a principal ∞-bundle”) as well as a curvature differential form datum, and, on the other hand, how the special cases of trivial underlying classes equipped with differential form datum and of flat differential form data sit inside the differential cohomology classes.
At this schematic conceptual level a differential cohomology diagram looks as follows (where all unlabelled arrows are meant to be read as “evident inclusions”);
  connectionformsontrivialbundles  ⟶deRhamdifferential  curvatureforms  ↗  ↘  ↗ curvature  ↘ deRhamtheorem flatdifferentialforms    geometricbundleswithconnection    rationalizedbundle  ↘  ↗  ↘ topol.class  ↗ Cherncharacter   geometricbundleswithflatconnection  ⟶comparison/regulatormap  shapeofbundle

  }


One characteristic property is that the two outer sequences are exact sequences. This expresses (at this rough schematic level) for instance (for the upper part) that the connections AA on trivial bundles whose curvature vanishes in that dA=0\mathbf{d}A = 0, are exactly the flat connections; as well as (for the lower part) that bundles with flat connections have torsion Chern-clases.
So a differential cohomology theory would be one whose cocycles/cohomology classes have the interpretation of (stable) principal ∞-bundles with connection such as in the middle of this diagram.
The characterization/construction of differential cohomology via homotopy fiber products (of mapping spectra with differential form data) due to (Hopkins-Singer 02) provides an incarnation of this kind of diagram genuinely in stable homotopy theory, so that the outer parts are indeed homotopy fiber sequences and the two squares are homotopy cartesian (are homotopy pullbacks/homotopy pushouts).
In (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13) it was observed (see Schreiber 13, section 4.1.2 for the generality in which we present this here) that every stable homotopy type E^\hat E in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} canonically sits inside a diagram of this form, being formed from the fracture squares of the units and counits of the shape modality Π\Pi and the flat modality ♭\flat, which in the right part are interpreted as the Maurer-Cartan form θ E\theta_E and the Chern character ch Ech_E:
  Π dRE^  ⟶d  ♭ dRE^  ↗  ↘  ↗ θ E^  ↘ Π dR♭E^    E^    Π♭ dRE^  ↘  ↗  ↘  ↗ ch E   ♭E^  ⟶  ΠE^.

    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{ch_E}}
    \\
    && \flat {\hat E} && \longrightarrow && \Pi \hat E
  }
  \,.


This is theorem  below.
For the special case that H=TSmooth∞Grpd\mathbf{H} = T Smooth\infty Grpd is the tangent (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids (∞-stacks over the site of smooth manifolds) this subsumes the cases mentioned above. But there are many examples of cohomology theories not of the form of (Hopkins-Singer 02) but represented by stable homotopy types in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos (see Schreiber 13, BunkeNikolausVölkl 13) and hence fitting into such a diagram, where the interpretation of the pieces of the diagram is just as it should be.
Therefore it makes sense to define generally that a differential cohomology diagram is the above combined fracture squares with its outer homotopy fiber sequences for shape modality and flat modality in any cohesive (∞,1)-topos.
The Kock–Lawvere axiom is the crucial axiom for the theory of synthetic differential geometry.
Imposed on a topos equipped with an internal algebra object RR over an internal ring object kk, the Kock–Lawvere axiom says essentially that morphisms D→RD \to R from the infinitesimal interval D⊂RD \subset R into RR are necessarily linear maps, in that they always and uniquely extend to linear maps R→RR \to R.
This linearity condition is what in synthetic differential geometry allows to identify the tangent bundle TX→XT X \to X of a space XX with its fiberwise linearity by simply the internal hom object X D→XX^D \to X.
Put the other way round, the Kock–Lawvere axiom axiomatizes the familiar statement that “to first order every smooth map is linear”.
In traditional differential geometry a smooth manifold may be thought of as a “locally linear space”: a space that is locally isomorphic to a vector space ≃ℝ n\simeq \mathbb{R}^n.
In the broader context of synthetic differential geometry there may exist spaces — in a smooth topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} with line object RR — considerably more general than manifolds. While for all of them there is a notion of tangent bundle TX:=X DT X : = X^D (sometimes called a synthetic tangent bundle, with DD the infinitesimal interval), not all such tangent bundles necessarily have RR-linear fibers!
A microlinear space is essentially an object XX in a smooth topos, such that its tangent bundle does have RR-linear fibers.
In fact the definition is a bit stronger than that, but the main point in practice of microlinearity is that the linearity of the fibers of the tangent bundle allows to apply most of the familiar constructions in differential geometry to these spaces.

Definition
(microlinear space)
Let 𝒯\mathcal{T} be a smooth topos with line object RR. An object X∈𝒯X \in \mathcal{T} is a microlinear space if for each diagram Δ:J→𝒯\Delta : J \to \mathcal{T} of infinitesimal spaces in 𝒯\mathcal{T} and for each cocone Δ→Δ c\Delta \to \Delta_c under it such that homming into RR produces a limit diagram , R c Δ≃lim j∈JR Δ jR^\Delta_c \simeq \lim_{j \in J} R^{\Delta_j}, also homming into XX produces a limit diagram: X c Δ≃lim j∈JX Δ jX^\Delta_c \simeq \lim_{j \in J} X^{\Delta_j}.

The main point of this definition is the following property.

Proposition
(fiberwise linearity of tangent bundle)
For every microlinear space XX, the tangent bundle X D→XX^D \to X has a natural fiberwise RR-module-structure.


Construction and Proof
We describe first the addition of tangent vectors, then the RR-action on them and then prove that this is a module-structure.


Addition With D={ϵ∈R|ϵ 2=0}D = \{\epsilon \in R| \epsilon^2 = 0 \} the infinitesimal interval and D(2)={(ϵ 1,ϵ 2)∈R×R|ϵ i 2=0}D(2) = \{(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2) \in R \times R | \epsilon_i^2 = 0\} we have a cocone
D(2) ← D ↑  ↑ D ← *
  \array{
    D(2) &\leftarrow& D
    \\
    \uparrow && \uparrow
    \\
    D &\leftarrow& {*}
  }


such that
R D(2) → R D ↓  ↓ R D → R
  \array{
    R^{D(2)} &\to & R^D
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    R^D &\to& R
  }


is a limit cone, by the Kock-Lawvere axiom satisfied in the smooth topos 𝒯\mathcal{T}. Since XX is microlinear, also the canonical map
r:X D(2)→X D× XX D
  r \colon X^{D(2)} \to X^D \times_X X^D


is an isomorphism. With Id×Id:D→D(2)\Id \times Id : D \to D(2) the diagonal map, we then define the fiberwise addition X D× XX D→X DX^D \times_X X^D \to X^D in the tangent bundle X DX^D to be given by the map
+:X D× XX D→r −1X D(2)→X Id×IdX D.  
  + : X^D \times_X X^D \stackrel{r^{-1}}{\to} X^{D(2)} \stackrel{X^{Id \times Id}}{\to}
  X^D
  \,.


On elements, this sends two elements v 1,v 2∈X Dv_1, v_2 \in X^D in the same fiber to the element v 1+v 2v_1 + v_2 of X DX^D given by the map (v 1+v 2):d↦r −1(v 1,v 2)(d,d)(v_1 + v_2) : d \mapsto r^{-1}(v_1,v_2)(d,d).


Multiplication ⋅:R×X D→X D \cdot : R \times X^D \to X^D is defined componentwise by
(α⋅v):d↦v(α⋅d)(\alpha \cdot v) : d \mapsto v (\alpha \cdot d).


One checks that this is indeed unital, associative and distributive. …

In the axiomatic formulation of differential geometry given by synthetic differential geometry the standard Kock-Lawvere axiom provides a notion of differentiation. In general this need not come with an inverse operation of integration. The additional integration axiom on a smooth topos does ensure this.

Definition
(integration axiom)
Let (𝒯,R)(\mathcal{T}, R) be a smooth topos and let the line object RR be equipped with the structure of a partial order (R,≤)(R, \leq) compatible with its ring structure (R,+,⋅)(R, +, \cdot) in the obvious way.
Then for any a,b∈Ra, b\in R write
[a,b]:={x∈R|a≤x≤b}
  [a,b] := \{x \in R | a \leq x \leq b\}


We say that (𝒯,(R,+,⋅,≤))(\mathcal{T},(R,+,\cdot,\leq)) satisfies the integration axiom if for all such intervals, all functions on the interval arise uniquely as derivatives on functions on the interval that vanish at the left boundary:
∀f∈R [a,b]:∃!∫ a −f∈R [a,b]:(∫ a −f)(a)=0∧(∫ a −f)′=f.
  \forall f \in R^{[a,b]} : \exists ! \int_a^{-} f \in R^{[a,b]} :
  (\int_a^{-} f)(a) = 0 \wedge (\int_a^{-} f)' = f
  \,.



… need to say more …

In a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos with fully faithful inverse image (such as a cohesive (∞,1)-topos), the extra left adjoint Π\Pi to the inverse image DiscDisc of the global sections geometric morphism Γ\Gamma induces a higher modality ʃ≔Disc∘Π\esh \coloneqq Disc \circ \Pi, which sends an object to something that may be regarded equivalently as its geometric realization or its fundamental ∞-groupoid (see at fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos and at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid). In either case ʃX\esh X may be thought of as the shape of XX and therefore one may call ʃ\esh the shape modality. It forms an adjoint modality with the flat modality ♭≔Disc∘Γ\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma.
In type theory
We assume a dependent type theory with crisp term judgments a::Aa::A in addition to the usual (cohesive) type and term judgments AtypeA \; \mathrm{type} and a:Aa:A, as well as context judgments Ξ|Γctx\Xi \vert \Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx} where Ξ\Xi is a list of crisp term judgments, and Γ\Gamma is a list of cohesive term judgments. A crisp type is a type in the context Ξ|()\Xi \vert (), where ()() is the empty list of cohesive term judgments. In addition, we also assume the dependent type theory has typal equality and judgmental equality, as well as the following axiom of cohesion:
There is a crisp type Ξ|()⊢Rtype\Xi \vert () \vdash R \; \mathrm{type} such that given any crisp type Ξ|()⊢Atype\Xi \vert () \vdash A \; \mathrm{type}, AA is discrete if and only if the function const A,R:A→(R→A)\mathrm{const}_{A, R}:A \to (R \to A) is an equivalence of types.
From here, there are two different notions of the shape modality which could be defined in the type theory, the strict shape modality, which uses judgmental equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule, and the weak shape modality, which uses typal equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule. When applied to a type they result in strict shape types and weak shape types respectively. The natural deduction rules for strict and weak shape types are provided as follows:

The shape modality is an example of a higher inductive type which states that the shape modality of a type AA ʃ(A)\esh(A) is the localization L R 1(A)L_{R^1}(A) of AA at the function const:A→(R→A)\mathrm{const}:A \to (R \to A), equivalent to const′:(1→A)→(R→A)\mathrm{const}':(1 \to A) \to (R \to A). Weak shape modalities are primarily used in cohesive objective type theories, while strict shape modalities are typically used in cohesive type theories with judgmental equality, such as cohesive Martin-Löf type theory (cohesive homotopy type theory or cohesive higher observational type theory.
Preservation of some ∞\infty-fiber products
The shape operation is defined to preserve finite homotopy products and small homotopy colimits (being a left adjoint) but it does not preserve general homotopy limits, not even all homotopy pullbacks:


Example
(shape does not preserve homotopy fibers of points over positive-dimensional smooth spheres)  For n∈ℕ +n \in \mathbb{N}_+ consider the 


n

n

-sphere in its standard incarnation as a smooth manifold (or just as a D-topological space) and as such as a 0-truncated smooth 


∞

-groupoid
S smth n∈SmthMfd↪SmthGrpd ∞.
  S^n_{smth} \,\in\, SmthMfd \hookrightarrow SmthGrpd_\infty
  \,.


This is such that the shape is the nn-sphere as a geometrically discrete higher homotopy type
ʃS smth n≃S n∈Grpd ∞↪DiscSmthGrpd ∞.
  \esh S^n_{smth} \,\simeq\, S^n \,\in\,
  Grpd_\infty 
  \xhookrightarrow{Disc} 
  SmthGrpd_{\infty}.


Now for x:*→S smth nx \colon \ast \to S^n_{smth} any point (and using that ʃ*=*\esh \ast \,=\, \ast by the condition that ʃ\esh preserves finite products):


its fiber product over S smth nS^n_{smth} may be computed in SmthMfd and hence is that same point:


its homotopy fiber product over S n=ʃS smth nS^n = \esh S^n_{smth} is the loop space ΩS n\Omega S^n, which (under our assumption that nn is a positive number) is far from equivalent to the point (for example: ΩS 1≃ℤ\Omega S^1 \,\simeq\, \mathbb{Z}).


Hence
n∈ℕ +⊢*≃ʃ(*×S smth n*)≠((ʃ*)×ʃS smth n(ʃ*))≃ΩS n.
  n \in \mathbb{N}_+

       {\esh S^n_{smth}}
       {\times}
    (\esh\ast) 
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \Omega S^{n}
  \,.





However, the shape modality does preserve some useful classes of homotopy fiber products after all:

 The following argument follows dcct, Thm. 3.8.19, which in turn follows discussion with Mike Shulman. The diagram is taken from the writeup of the proof given in SS21, Prop. 3.38.

Now Fnctr(B,Shp)Fnctr(B,Shp) preserves binary products as soon as ShpShp does (because products of presheaves are computed objectwise). But binary products in the equivalent slice category H /B\mathbf{H}_{/B} are the homotopy fiber products in question, and hence the claim follows.

Proof
Since a discrete ∞\infty-groupoid XX is the coproduct of its connected components, and since coproducts are preserved by homotopy pullback (due to universal colimits in an

First, observe that the pasting law for homotopy pullbacks gives the pasting diagram of homotopy pullbacks shown on the left below:

  }


Now, as shown on the right, the shape modality


preserves the left pullback square and its bottom effective epimorphism, by Prop. ;


preserves the outer pullback rectangle by Prop. .


Therefore also the square on the far right is homotopy Cartesian, by the “reverse pasting law” (this Prop.). But this is equivalently the claim to be shown.



More specific cases
The following discussion is about the topological/smooth shape modality commuting with looping (homotopy fiber products of points) of mapping stacks between delooping stacks of certain topological groups. This is a technical point of crucial importance in the construction and discussion of equivariant classifying spaces for equivariant principal bundles – though not traditionally presented as being about behaviour under a shape modality. The following perspective is from SS21, though the hard results themselves are either classical (essentially Conner & Floyd 1964, Lemma 31.8 for the case of compact Γ\Gamma) or, in more generality, due to Uribe & Lück 2014. (Beware that the following differs from their notation by the exchange “GG” ↔\leftrightarrow “Γ\Gamma”! For us here, GG denotes the equivariance group and Γ\Gamma the structure group.)

fiber products, i.e. under products in Grp(kTop) /ΓGrp(kTop)_{/\Gamma},


conjugation by Γ\Gamma (under postcomposition),


conjugation by GG (under precomposition).


We say (with Uribe & Lück 2014, Def. 6.1) that such data satisfies Condition H if for all (H,ρ)∈ℛ(H,
\rho) \,\in\, \mathcal{R} we have:


the path component of ρ\rho in HomMap(H,Γ)HomMap(H,\Gamma) is contained in its orbit under the Γ\Gamma-conjugation action:

with ℛ\mathcal{R} consisting of all compact subsgroups H⊂GH \subset G and all their homomorphisms H→ΓH \to \Gamma
(established in Uribe & Lück 2014, Thm. 6.3)


Γ=\Gamma = PU(ℋ) and GG any finite group
with ℛ\mathcal{R} consisting of all subgroups H⊂GH \subset G and all their homomorphisms H→PU(ℋ)H \to 
PU(\mathcal{H})
(established in Uribe & Lück 2014, Sec. 15)





For the following formulation of the main result of Uribe & Lück 2014 in terms of cohesive homotopy theory we use the continuous diffeology
kTop→CDfflgDiffSp↪SmthGrp ∞
  kTop
  \xrightarrow{CDfflg}
  DiffSp
  \hookrightarrow
  SmthGrp_\infty


and the fact that this preserves shapes and shapes of mapping spaces (see the introduction of SS21).


Proposition
(shape commutes with looping of mapping stacks between delooping stacks of certain pairs of topological groups)  For


GG a finite group


Γ\Gamma a compact Lie group or PU(ℋ),


we have for all homomorphisms ρ:H→Γ\rho \,\colon\, H \to \Gamma from subgroups H⊂GH \subset G that the shape modality commutes with the looping-operation on the mapping stack between the deloopings of HH and Γ\Gamma in

is the GG-equivariant homotopy type of the GG-equivariant classifying space of Γ\Gamma.
(For Γ\Gamma compact Lie this is the Murayama-Shimakawa result as reviewed in Guillou, May & Merling 2017, Thm. 3.1, while for Γ=PU(ℋ)\Gamma = PU(\mathcal{H}) this is due to Bárcenas, Espinoza, Joachim & Uribe 2012, with a re-derivation in a more explicitly cohesive context in SS21).
Moreover, by Exp.  both cases satisfy Condition H (Def. ), whence the main result Uribe & Lück 2014, Sec. 13 applies, which, using the above identification of the equivariant classifying space, gives a weak homotopy equivalence of the form
∐[ρ]∈Hom(H,Γ)/ΓBStab Γ(ρ)≃ʃMap(BH,BΓ).

(For Γ\Gamma a Lie group this is the classical fact that nearby homomorphisms from compact Lie groups are conjugate.)
Observing that BStab Γ(ρ)≃BʃStab Γ(ρ)B Stab_\Gamma(\rho) \,\simeq\, \mathbf{B} \esh Stab_\Gamma(\rho), the looping of this equivalence at the basepoint given by ρ\rho yields the claim.



Relative shape and factorization system
Generally, given an (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} (or just a 1-topos) equipped with an idempotent monad ʃ:H→H\esh \colon \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H} (a (higher) modality/closure operator) which preserves (∞,1)-pullbacks over objects in its essential image, one may call a morphism f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y in H\mathbf{H} ʃ\esh-closed if the unit-diagram
X ⟶η X ʃ(X) ↓ f  ↓ ʃ(f) Y ⟶η Y ʃ(Y)
  \array{
    X 
    &\overset{\eta_X}{\longrightarrow}& \esh(X)
    \\
    \big\downarrow {\mathrlap{{}^f}} 
    && 
    \big\downarrow{\mathrlap{{}^{\esh(f)}}}
    \\
    Y 
    &
    \overset{\eta_Y}{\longrightarrow}
    & 
    \esh(Y)
  }


is an (∞,1)-pullback diagram. These ʃ\esh-closed morphisms form the right half of an orthogonal factorization system, the left half being the morphisms that are sent to equivalences in H\mathbf{H}.

Definition
Let (Π⊣Disc⊣Γ):H→∞Grpd(\Pi\dashv \Disc\dashv \Gamma):H\to\infty\Grpd be an infinity-connected (infinity,1)-topos, let ʃ:=DiscΠ\esh:=\Disc \Pi be the geometric path functor / geometric homotopy functor, let f:X→Yf:X\to Y be a HH-morphism, let c ʃfc_{\esh} f denote the ∞-pullback
c ʃf ⟶ ʃX ↓  ↓ ʃ f Y →1 (Π⊣Disc) ʃY
  \array{
    c_{\esh} f
    &\longrightarrow& 
    {\esh} X
    \\
    \big\downarrow
    &&
    \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{{\esh}_f}}   
    \\
    Y
    &\xrightarrow{1_{(\Pi\dashv \Disc)}}
    &
    {\esh}Y
  }


c ʃfc_{\esh} f is called ʃ\esh-closure of ff.
ff is called ʃ\esh-closed if X≃c ʃfX\simeq c_{\esh}f.

If a morphism f:X→Yf:X\to Y factors into f=g∘hf=g\circ h and hh is a ʃ\esh-equivalence then gg is ʃ\esh-closed; this is seen by using that ʃ\esh is idempotent.
Π\Pi-closed morphisms are a right class of an orthogonal factorization system (in an (∞,1)-category) and hence, as discussed there, are closed under limits, composition, retracts and satisfy the left cancellation property.


Remark
(shape-modal maps as open maps)  A consequence of the previous property is that the class of ʃ\esh-closed morphisms gives rise to an admissible structure in the sense of structured spaces on an (∞,1)-connected (∞,1)-topos, hence they serve as a class of a kind of open maps.


Shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid
See at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid.
On a local topos/local (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, hence with extra fully faithful right adjoint coDisccoDisc to the global section geometric morphism (Disc⊣Γ)(Disc \dashv \Gamma), is canonically induced the idempotent comonad ♭≔Disc∘Γ\flat \coloneqq Disc\circ \Gamma. This modality sends for instance pointed connected objects BG\mathbf{B}G to coefficients ♭BG\flat \mathbf{B}G for flat principal ∞-connections, and may therefore be referred to as the flat modality. It is itself the left adjoint in an adjoint modality with the sharp modality ♯≔coDisc∘Γ\sharp \coloneqq coDisc \circ \Gamma. If H\mathbf{H} is in addition a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then it is also the right adjoint in an adjoint modality with the shape modality ∫\int.
In type theory
We assume a dependent type theory with crisp term judgments a::Aa::A in addition to the usual (cohesive) type and term judgments AtypeA \; \mathrm{type} and a:Aa:A, as well as context judgments Ξ|Γctx\Xi \vert \Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx} where Ξ\Xi is a list of crisp term judgments, and Γ\Gamma is a list of cohesive term judgments. A crisp type is a type in the context Ξ|()\Xi \vert (), where ()() is the empty list of cohesive term judgments. In addition, we also assume the dependent type theory has typal equality and judgmental equality.
From here, there are two different notions of the flat modality which could be defined in the type theory, the strict flat modality, which uses judgmental equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule, and the weak flat modality, which uses typal equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule. When applied to a type they result in strict flat types and weak flat types respectively. The natural deduction rules for strict and weak flat types are provided as follows:

Formation rule for weak and strict flat types:

Weak flat modalities are primarily used in cohesive objective type theories, while strict flat modalities are typically used in cohesive type theories with judgmental equality, such as cohesive Martin-Löf type theory (cohesive homotopy type theory or cohesive higher observational type theory.
Relation to discrete and codiscrete objects


The codiscrete objects in a local topos are the modal types for the sharp modality.


The discrete objects in a local topos are the modal types for the flat modality.


On a local topos/local (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, hence equipped with a fully faithful extra right adjoint coDisccoDisc to the global section geometric morphism (Disc⊣Γ)(Disc \dashv \Gamma), is induced an idempotent monad ♯≔coDisc∘Γ\sharp \coloneqq coDisc \circ \Gamma, a modality which we call the sharp modality. This is itself the right adjoint in an adjoint modality with the flat modality ♭≔Disc∘Γ\flat \coloneqq Disc \circ \Gamma.
In type theory
We assume a dependent type theory with crisp term judgments a::Aa::A in addition to the usual (cohesive) type and term judgments AtypeA \; \mathrm{type} and a:Aa:A, as well as context judgments Ξ|Γctx\Xi \vert \Gamma \; \mathrm{ctx} where Ξ\Xi is a list of crisp term judgments, and Γ\Gamma is a list of cohesive term judgments. A crisp type is a type in the context Ξ|()\Xi \vert (), where ()() is the empty list of cohesive term judgments. In addition, we also assume the dependent type theory has typal equality and judgmental equality.
From here, there are two different notions of the sharp modality which could be defined in the type theory, the strict sharp modality, which uses judgmental equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule, and the weak sharp modality, which uses typal equality in the computation rule and uniqueness rule.

Weak sharp modalities are primarily used in cohesive objective type theories, while strict sharp modalities are typically used in cohesive type theories with judgmental equality, such as cohesive Martin-Löf type theory (cohesive homotopy type theory or cohesive higher observational type theory.
Relation to discrete and codiscrete objects


The codiscrete objects in a local topos are the modal types for the sharp modality.


The discrete objects in a local topos are the modal types for the flat modality.


A discrete space is, in general, an object of a concrete category SpSp of spaces that is free on its own underlying set. More generally, the notion can be applied relative to any forgetful functor.
Note: This page is about the “cohesive” or “topological” notion of discreteness. In 2-category theory the term “discrete object” is also often used for 0-truncated objects. For this usage, see discrete morphism instead.
A discrete space must, in particular, be a free object for the forgetful functor U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp\to Set, i.e. in the image of its left adjoint F:Set→SpF: Set \to Sp. However, this is not sufficient for it to be free on its own underlying set; we must also require that the counit FUX→XF U X\to X be an isomorphism.
Thus, we say that U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp \to Set (or more generally, any functor) has discrete spaces or discrete objects if it has a fully faithful left adjoint. This ensures that the functor
Set→FSp→USet Set \stackrel{F}\to Sp \stackrel{U}\to Set 
is (naturally isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set. This is true, for example, if SpSp is Top, Diff, Loc, etc.
Assuming that UU is faithful (as it is when SpSp is a concrete category), we can characterise a discrete space XX as one such that every function from XX to YY (for YY any space) is a morphism of spaces. (More precisely, this means that every function from U(X)U(X) to U(Y)U(Y) is the image under UU of a morphism from XX to YY.)
The dual notion is a codiscrete object.
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
An object in the essential image of coDisccoDisc is called a codiscrete object.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc)ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
If one thinks of ℰ\mathcal{E} as a category of spaces, then the codiscrete objects are called codiscrete spaces.
The dual notion is that of discrete objects.


Proposition
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.



Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has a terminal object that is preserved by Γ\Gamma, then ℰ\mathcal{E} has concrete objects.

This is (Shulman, theorem 1).

Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has codiscrete objects and has pullbacks that are preserved by Γ\Gamma and , then Γ\Gamma is a Grothendieck fibration.

This is (Shulman, theorem 2).
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \;\colon\; \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc \,\colon\, \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \;\colon\; \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
In this situation, we say that a concrete object X∈ℰX \in \mathcal{E} is one for which the (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc)-unit of an adjunction is a monomorphism.
If ℰ\mathcal{E} is a sheaf topos, this is called a concrete sheaf.
If ℰ\mathcal{E} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then this is called a concrete (∞,1)-sheaf or the like.
The dual notion is that of a co-concrete object.
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.
Concretification factorization

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a local topos, write
H conc↪AAAAH
  \mathbf{H}_{conc} 
  \overset{ \phantom{AAAA} }{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}


for its full subcategory of concrete objects.
Then there is a sequence of reflective subcategory-inclusions that factor the (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc)-adjunction as
Γ⊣coDisc:H⟶AAconcAA ↩AAι concAAH conc⟶AAA ↩AAASet
  \Gamma \;\dashv\; coDisc
  \;\;\colon\;\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \array{
    \overset{\phantom{AA} conc \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
    \\
    \overset{\phantom{AA} \iota_{conc} \phantom{AA}}{\hookleftarrow}
  }
  \mathbf{H}_{conc}
  \array{
    \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\longrightarrow}
    \\
    \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookleftarrow}
  }
  Set


Here morphisms on top are left adjoint to morphisms below, hence
conc⊣ι conc
  conc \dashv \iota_{conc}


exhibits the concrete objects as a reflective subcategory, the reflector concconc being “concretification”.


Proof
For the adjunction on the right, we just need to observe that for every set S∈SetS \in Set, the codiscrete object coDisc(S)coDisc(S) is concrete, which is immediate by idempotency of ♯\sharp and the fact that every isomorphism is also a monomorphism.
For the adjunction on the left we claim that the left adjoint concconc (concretification), is given by sending each object to the image of its (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc) adjunction unit η ♯\eta^\sharp:
conc:X↦im(η X ♯)
  conc \;\colon\; X \mapsto im(\eta^\sharp_X)


hence to the object which exhibits the epi/mono-factorization of η X ♯\eta^\sharp_X
(1)η X ♯:X⟶epiη X concconcX⟶mono♯X.
  
  \eta^\sharp_X
  \;\colon\;
  X 
    \underoverset{epi}{ \eta^{conc}_X }{\longrightarrow}
  conc X
    \underoverset{mono}{}{\longrightarrow}
  \sharp X
  \,.


First we need to show that concXconc X, thus defined, is indeed concrete, hence that η im(η X ♯) ♯\eta^\sharp_{im(\eta^\sharp_X)} is a monomorphism. For this, consider the following naturality square of the Γ⊣coDisc\Gamma \dashv coDisc-adjunction hom-isomorphism
(2)A Hom Set(Γim(η X ♯),Γim(η X ♯)) ≃ Hom H(im(η X ♯),♯im(η X ♯))  (−)∘Γ(η X conc)↓  ↓ (−)∘η X conc Hom Set(ΓX,Γim(η X ♯)) ≃ Hom H(X,♯im(η X ♯))AAAAA {id Γim(η X ♯)} ⟶ ♯(η X conc)∘η X ♯{η im(η X ♯) ♯} ↓  ♯(η X conc)∘η X ♯↓ {Γ(η X conc)} ⟶ {♯(η X conc)⏟iso∘η X ♯=η im(η X ♯) ♯∘η X conc}
  
  \array{
    {\phantom{A}}
    \\
    Hom_{Set}( \Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X), \Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X) )
    &\simeq&
    Hom_{\mathbf{H}}( im(\eta^\sharp_X), \sharp im(\eta^\sharp_X) )
    \\
    {}^{ \mathllap{ (-) \circ \Gamma(\eta^{conc}_X) } }\big\downarrow      
      &&
    \big\downarrow^{
      \mathrlap{ (-) \circ \eta^{conc}_X }
    }
    \\
    Hom_{Set}( \Gamma X, \Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X) )
    &\simeq&
    Hom_{\mathbf{H}}( X, \sharp im(\eta^\sharp_X) )    
  }
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \array{
    {\phantom{A}}
    \\
    \left\{ id_{\Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X)} \right\}
      &\longrightarrow&
    \phantom{\sharp(\eta^{conc}_X) \circ \eta^\sharp_{ X }}
    \left\{ \eta^{\sharp}_{im(\eta^\sharp_X)} \right\}
    \\
    \big\downarrow 
      && 
    \phantom{\sharp(\eta^{conc}_X) \circ \eta^\sharp_{ X }}
    \big\downarrow
    \\
    \left\{ \Gamma(\eta^{conc}_X) \right\}
      &\longrightarrow& 
    \left\{
      \underset{
        iso
      }{ 
      \underbrace{
         \sharp(\eta^{conc}_X)
      }}
      \circ \eta^\sharp_{ X }
      \;=\;
    \eta^{\sharp}_{ im(\eta^\sharp_X) } \circ \eta^{conc}_X 
    \right\}
  }


By chasing the identity morphism on Γim(η X ♯)\Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X) through this diagram, as shown by the diagram on the right, we obtain the equality displayed in the bottom right entry, where we used the general formula for adjuncts and the definition ♯≔coDisc∘Γ\sharp \coloneqq coDisc \circ \Gamma.
But observe that Γ(η X conc)\Gamma (\eta^{conc}_X), and hence also ♯(η X conc)\sharp(\eta^{conc}_X), is an isomorphism, as indicated above: Since Γ\Gamma is both a left adjoint as well as a right adjoint, it preserves both epimorphisms as well as monomorphisms, hence it preserves image factorizations. This implies that Γη X conc\Gamma \eta^{conc}_X is the epimorphism onto the image of Γ(η X ♯)\Gamma( \eta^\sharp_X ). But by idempotency of ♯\sharp, the latter is an isomorphism, and hence so is the epimorphism in its image factorization.
Therefore the equality in (2) says that
η X ♯ =(iso∘η im(η X ♯) ♯)∘η X conc  =mono∘η X conc,
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta^\sharp_{ X } 
      & =
    \left( 
      iso \circ \eta^{\sharp}_{ im(\eta^\sharp_X)} 
    \right)
      \circ 
    \eta^{conc}_X
    \\
    & =
    mono \circ \eta^{conc}_X 
    \,,
  \end{aligned}


where in the second line we remembered that η X conc\eta^{conc}_X is, by definition, the epimorphism in the epi/mono-factorization of η X ♯\eta^\sharp_X.
Now the defining property of epimorphisms allows to cancel this commmon factor on both sides, which yields
η im(η X ♯) ♯=iso∘mono=mono.
  \eta^{\sharp}_{ im(\eta^\sharp_X) }
  \;=\;
  iso \circ mono
  \;=\;
  mono.


This shows that concX≔im(η X ♯)conc X \coloneqq im(\eta^\sharp_X) is indeed concrete.
It remains to show that this construction is left adjoint to the inclusion. We claim that the adjunction unit of (conc⊣ι conc)(conc \dashv \iota_{conc}) is provided by η conc\eta^{conc} (1).
To see this, first notice that, since the epi/mono-factorization is orthogonal and hence functorial, we have commuting diagrams of the form
(3)X 1 ⟶epiη X 1 conc im(η X 1 ♯) ⟶mono ♯X 1 ↓  ↓  ↓ X 2 ⟶epiη X 2 conc im(η X 2 ♯) ⟶mono ♯X 2
  
  \array{
    X_1 
      &\underoverset{epi}{\eta^{conc}_{X_1}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_1})
      &\underset{mono}{\longrightarrow}&
    \sharp X_1
    \\
    \big\downarrow && \big\downarrow && \big\downarrow
    \\
    X_2 
      &\underoverset{epi}{\eta^{conc}_{X_2}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_2})
      &\underset{mono}{\longrightarrow}&
    \sharp X_2
  }


Now to demonstrate the adjunction, it is sufficient, to show that η conc\eta^{conc} is a universal morphism in the sense discussed at adjoint functors. Hence consider any morphism f:X 1→X 2f \;\colon\; X_1 \to X_2 with X 2∈H conc↪HX_2 \in \mathbf{H}_{conc} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}. Then we need to show that there is a unique diagonal morphism as below, that makes the following top left triangle commute:
X 1 ⟶AAfAA X 2  epi↓ η X 1 conc  ∃!↗ ↓ mono im(η X 1 ♯) ⟶ ♯X 2
  \array{
    X_1 
      &\overset{\phantom{AA} f \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    X_2
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{epi}}\big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta^{conc}_{X_1}}} 
      &{}^{\mathllap{\exists !}}\nearrow& 
    \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{mono}}
    \\
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_1}) 
      &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& 
    \sharp X_2

Now, from (3), we have a commuting square as shown. Here the left morphism is an epimorphism by construction, while the right morphism is a monomorphism by assumption on X 2X_2. With this, the epi/mono-factorization says that there is a diagonal lift which makes both triangles commute.
It remains to see that the lift is unique with just the property of making the top left triangle commute. But this is equivalently the statement that the left morphism is an epimorphism.

 The point here is the given interpretation of this lifting problem, but the proof of the latter is immediate: 

Proof
Under the given assumptions, the essentially unique existence of the lift is an instance of the (n-connected, n-truncated) factorization system for n=(−1)n = (-1).


In a cohesive (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, the canonical natural transformation
♭→Π
  \flat \to \Pi


from the flat modality to the shape modality may be thought of as sending “points to the pieces in which they sit”.
A cohesive (∞,1)-topos is infinitesimal cohesive if all its objects behave as though built from infinitesimally thickened geometrically discrete ∞-groupoids in that they all have “precisely one point in each cohesive piece”.
(There is an evident version of an infinitesimally cohesive 1-topos. In (Lawvere 07, def. 1) such is referred to as a “quality type”. A hint of this seems to be also in (Lawvere 91, p. 9)).
Infinitesimal cohesion may also be defined relative to any (∞,1)-topos.

Remark
A cohesive (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} with its shape modality ⊣\dashv flat modality ⊣\dashv sharp modality denoted ʃ⊣♭⊣♯&#643; \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp is infinitesimal cohesive if the canonical points-to-pieces transform is an equivalence

in which case all three modal operators collapse to a single “classical modality” ♮\natural of a bireflective subcategory.


Remark
The underlying adjoint triple Π⊣Disc⊣Γ\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma in the case of infinitesimal cohesion is an ambidextrous adjunction. Such a localization is called a “quintessential localization” by Johnstone (1996), see at bireflective subcategory.

(2023).
The tangent (∞,1)-category THT\mathbf{H} to a cohesive (∞,1)-topos is itself cohesive: the tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos.
This THT \mathbf{H} is the ∞\infty-topos of parameterized spectra in H\mathbf{H}, hence is the context for cohesive stable homotopy theory.
Stable extension of cohesion
Let H\mathbf{H} be a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.
By the discussion at tangent ∞-category – Examples – Of an ∞-topos the tangent ∞\infty-topos THT \mathbf{H} constitutes an extension of H\mathbf{H} by its stabilization Stab(H)Stab(\mathbf{H}):

Here


Ω ∞∘tot:TH⟶H\Omega^\infty \circ tot \;\colon\; T \mathbf{H} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H} assigns the total space of a spectrum bundle;
its left adjoint is the tangent complex functor;


base:TH⟶Hbase \;\colon\; T \mathbf{H} \longrightarrow \mathbf{H} assigns the base space of a spectrum bundle;
its left adjoint produces the 0-bundle;
together these exhibit THT \mathbf{H} as an infinitesimal cohesive (infinity,1)-topos over H\mathbf{H}.


Stable homotopy types
In a tangent cohesive ∞\infty-topos THT \mathbf{H} all the homotopy types in T *H↪THT_\ast \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow T\mathbf{H} are stable homotopy types.
Cohomology – Twisted bivariant generalized geometric cohomology theory
Where the (∞,1)-categorical hom-space in a general (∞,1)-topos constitute a notion of cohomology, those of a tangent (∞,1)-topos specifically constitute twisted generalized cohomology, in fact twisted bivariant cohomology.
For consider a spectrum object E∈T *HE \in T_\ast \mathbf{H} and write GL 1(E)∈Grp(H)GL_1(E) \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) for its ∞-group of units. Then the ∞-action of this on EE is (by the discussion there) exhibited by an object
(E//GL 1(E) ↓ BGL 1(E))∈T BGL 1(E)H↪TH.
  \left(
   \array{
     E//GL_1(E)
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)
   }
  \right)
  \;\;\;
   \in
  \;\;\;
  T_{\mathbf{B}GL_1(E)}\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow T\mathbf{H}
  \,.


More generally, for Pic(E)∈HPic(E) \in \mathbf{H} the Picard ∞-groupoid of EE there is the universal (∞,1)-line bundle
(Pic(E)^→Pic(E))∈TH.
  (\widehat{Pic(E)} \to Pic(E)) \in T \mathbf{H}
  \,.


Now for any object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} we have the trivial sphere spectrum spectrum bundle over XX
X×𝕊≃(X×𝕊 ↓ X)∈T XH↪TH.
  X \times \mathbb{S}
  \simeq
  \left(
   \array{
     X \times \mathbb{S}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     X
   }
  \right)
  \;\;\;
   \in
  \;\;\;
  T_{X}\mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow T\mathbf{H}
  \,.


then morphisms in THT \mathbf{H} from the latter to the former
(X×𝕊 ↓ X)⟶(E//GL 1(E) ↓ BGL 1(E))
    \left(
   \array{
     X \times \mathbb{S}
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     X
   }
  \right)
  \longrightarrow
  \left(
   \array{
     E//GL_1(E)
     \\
     \downarrow
     \\
     \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)
   }
  \right)


are equivalently homotopy commuting diagrams of the form
X×𝕊 ⟶σ E//GL 1(E) ↓  ↓ X ⟶χ BGL 1(E)
  \array{
    X \times \mathbb{S} &\stackrel{\sigma}{\longrightarrow}& E//GL_1(E)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\chi}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}GL_1(E)
  }


and hence


a choice of twist of E-cohomology χ:X⟶BGL 1(E)\chi \;\colon \; X  \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}GL_1(E), modulating a GL 1(E)GL_1(E)-principal ∞-bundle;


an element in the χ\chi-twisted EE-cohomology of XX, σ∈E •+χ(X,E)\sigma \in E^{\bullet + \chi}(X,E), hence a section of the associated (∞,1)-line bundle.


If we consider the internal hom instead of the external (∞,1)-categorical hom space then things work even more nicely and we can use just XX instead of X×𝕊X \times \mathbb{S}:

Proposition
For X∈H↪0THX \in \mathbf{H} \stackrel{0}{\hookrightarrow} T \mathbf{H} a geometric homotopy type and E∈Stab(H)≃T *H↪THE \in Stab(\mathbf{H}) \simeq T_\ast \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H} a spectrum object, then the internal hom/mapping stack
[X,E] TH∈TH
  [X,E]_{T \mathbf{H}} \in T \mathbf{H}


(with respect to the Cartesian closed monoidal (∞,1)-category structure on the (∞,1)-topos is equivalently the mapping spectrum
[Σ ∞X,E] Stab(H)∈Stab(H)↪TH,
  [\Sigma^\infty X, E]_{Stab(\mathbf{H})} \in Stab(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H}
  \,,


in that
[X,E] TH≃[Σ ∞X,E] Stab(H).
  [X,E]_{T \mathbf{H}} \simeq [\Sigma^\infty X,E]_{Stab(\mathbf{H})}
  \,.



Proof
Notice that as an object of TH↪H seqT \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}^{seq}, the object XX is the constant (∞,1)-presheaf on seqseq. By the formula for the internal hom in an (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves we have
[X,E] •≃H seq(X×•,E).
  [X,E]_\bullet \simeq \mathbf{H}^{seq}(X \times \bullet, E)
  \,.


But since XX is constant the object X×•X \times \bullet is for each object of seqseq the presheaf represented by that object. Therefore by the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma it follows that
[X,E] •≃[X,E •].
  [X,E]_\bullet \simeq [X,E_\bullet]
  \,.


This is manifestly the same formula as for the mapping spectrum out of Σ ∞X\Sigma^\infty X.

Similar kind of arguments give the following more general statement.

Proposition
For X∈H↪0THX \in \mathbf{H} \stackrel{0}{\hookrightarrow} T \mathbf{H} a geometric homotopy type, for E∈E ∞(H)E \in E_\infty(\mathbf{H}) an E-∞ ring with (Pic(E)^→Pic(E))↪TH(\widehat{Pic(E)} \to Pic(E)) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H} its universal (∞,1)-line bundle over its Picard ∞-groupoid, then the internal hom/mapping stack
[X,Pic(E)^] TH∈TH
  [X,\widehat{Pic(E)}]_{T \mathbf{H}} \in T \mathbf{H}


is the object whose


base homotopy type is the E-∞ ring [X,Pic(E)][X, Pic(E)] of EE-twist on XX;


whose spectrum bundle is the collection of χ\chi-twisted E-cohomology spectra for all twists χ\chi.



In full generality we may formulate the internal hom mapping space in THT \mathbf{H} in homotopy type theory notation as follows.

Proposition
For
(a:A)⊢E a:Spectra(H)
  (a \colon A) \;\vdash\; E_a \colon Spectra(\mathbf{H})


and
(b:B)⊢F b:Spectra(H)
  (b \colon B) \;\vdash\; F_b \colon Spectra(\mathbf{H})


two spectrum bundle dependent types over base homotopy types, A,B:HA,B \colon \mathbf{H}, respectively, then the function type (E→F):TH(E \to F) \colon T\mathbf{H} between them (regarded as homotopy types in THT \mathbf{H}) is
χ:(A→B);σ:∏a:ASpMap(E a,F χ(a))⊢∏a:AF χ(a).
  \chi \colon (A \to B); \sigma \colon \underset{a \colon A}{\prod} SpMap(E_a,F_{\chi(a)})
  \;\vdash\;
  \underset{a \colon A}{\prod} F_{\chi(a)}
  \,.



Proof
Let (x:X)⊢M x:Spectra(x:X)\vdash M_x : Spectra be another spectrum bundle. The cartesian product M×EM\times E in THT \mathbf{H} is then (x:X),(a:A)⊢M x⊕E a(x:X),(a:A) \vdash M_x \oplus E_a, with ⊕\oplus also the coproduct (hence the direct sum), since spectra are stable and hence additive. We compute the mapping space TH(M×E,F)T\mathbf{H}(M\times E,F) as follows:
∑ (ϕ:X×A→B)∏ ((x,a):X×A)SpMap(M x⊕E a,F ϕ(x,a)) = ∑ (ϕ:X→A→B)∏ (x:X)∏ (a:A)SpMap(E a,F ϕ(x,a))×SpMap(M x,F ϕ(x,a))  = ∏ (x:X)∑ (χ:A→B)(∏ (a:A)SpMap(E a,F χ(a)))×(∏ (a:A)SpMap(M x,F χ(a)))  = ∏ (x:X)∑ ψ:∑ (χ:A→B)∏ (a:A)SpMap(E a,F χ(a))SpMap(M x,∏ (a:A)F pr 1(ψ)(a))  = ∑ ρ:X→∑ (χ:A→B)∏ (a:A)SpMap(E a,F χ(a))∏ (x:A)SpMap(M x,∏ (a:A)F pr 1(ρ(x))(a))
\begin{aligned}
  \sum_{(\phi:X\times A \to B)} \prod_{((x,a):X\times A)} SpMap(M_x\oplus E_a,F_{\phi(x,a)})
  &=& \sum_{(\phi:X \to A \to B)} \prod_{(x:X)} \prod_{(a:A)} SpMap(E_a,F_{\phi(x,a)}) \times SpMap(M_x,F_{\phi(x,a)})\\
  &=& \prod_{(x:X)} \sum_{(\chi:A \to B)} \left(\prod_{(a:A)} SpMap(E_a,F_{\chi(a)})\right) \times \left( \prod_{(a:A)} SpMap(M_x,F_{\chi(a)}) \right)\\
  &=& \prod_{(x:X)} \sum_{\psi : \sum_{(\chi:A \to B)} \prod_{(a:A)} SpMap(E_a,F_{\chi(a)})} SpMap\left(M_x, \prod_{(a:A)} F_{pr_1(\psi)(a)}\right)\\
  &=& \sum_{\rho : X \to \sum_{(\chi:A \to B)} \prod_{(a:A)} SpMap(E_a,F_{\chi(a)})} \prod_{(x:A)} SpMap\left(M_x, \prod_{(a:A)} F_{pr_1(\rho(x))(a)}\right)
\end{aligned}


In the first line, we curry ϕ\phi, apply the induction principle for dependent maps out of X×AX\times A, and also apply the universal property of the coproduct M x⊕E aM_x \oplus E_a. In the second line, we apply the universal property for mapping into ∞-types? (the “type-theoretic axiom of choice”) and also that for dependent functions into a product. In the third line we apply the associativity of ∞-types?, and also the universal property for mapping into the dependent product ∏\prod of spectra. Finally, in the fourth line, we apply the type-theoretic axiom of choice again in the other direction. The resulting type is the mapping space from MM to the claimed function type (E→F)(E\to F) defined above. (See also this discussion.)


Example
We have the following special cases of prop. .


If E a=0E_a = 0 for all a:Aa \colon A, and if B=*B = \ast, then the function type is
⊢∏a:AF
  \vdash \; \underset{a \colon A}{\prod} F


which reproduces the mapping spectrum SpMap(Σ ∞A,F)SpMap(\Sigma^\infty A, F) from prop. .


If A=B=*A = B = \ast then the mapping type is
σ:SpMap(E,F)⊢F:Spectra
  \sigma \colon SpMap(E,F) \;\vdash \; F \colon Spectra



If E a=0E_a = 0 for all a:Aa \colon A and F b=0F_b = 0 for all b:Bb \colon B then the mapping type is
χ:(A→B)⊢0:Spectra.
  \chi \colon (A \to B)\;\vdash \; 0 \colon Spectra
  \,.




Cohesive and differential refinement
Let THT\mathbf{H} be a tangent cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos and write T *HT_\ast \mathbf{H} for the stable (∞,1)-category of spectrum objects inside it. We discuss how every stable homotopy type here canonically sits in the middle of a differential cohomology diagram.

Proposition
For every A∈T *HA \in T_\ast \mathbf{H} the naturality square
A ⟶ A/♭A ↓  (pb) ↓ Π(A) ⟶ Π(A/♭A)
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A/\flat A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }


(of the shape modality applied to the homotopy cofiber of the counit of the flat modality) is an (∞,1)-pullback square.

This was observed in (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13). It is an incarnation of a fracture theorem.

Proof
By cohesion and stability we have the diagram
♭A ⟶ A ⟶ A/♭A ↓ ≃  ↓  ↓ Π(♭A) ⟶ Π(A) ⟶ Π(A/♭A)
  \array{
    \flat A &\longrightarrow & A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A/\flat A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(\flat A) &\longrightarrow& \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }


where both rows are homotopy fiber sequences. By cohesion the left vertical map is an equivalence. The claim now follows with the homotopy fiber characterization of homotopy pullbacks.


Remark
This means that in stable cohesion every cohesive stable homotopy type is in controled sense a cohesive extension/refinement of its geometric realization geometrically discrete (“bare”) stable homotopy type by the non-discrete part of its cohesive structure;
In particular, A/♭AA/\flat A may be identified with differential cycle data. Indeed, by stability and cohesion it is the flat de Rham coefficient object
A/♭A=♭ dRΣA
  A/\flat A = \flat_{dR}\Sigma A


of the suspension of AA, and the map to this quotient is thus the Maurer-Cartan form θ A\theta_A. So
A ⟶θ A ♭ dRΣA ↓  (pb) ↓ Π(A) ⟶ Π(A/♭A)
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{\theta_A}{\longrightarrow}& \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }


exhibits AA as a differential cohomology-coefficient of the generalized cohomology theory Π(A)\Pi(A).
It follows by the discussion at differential cohomology in a cohesive topos that the further differential refinement A^\widehat{A} of AA should be given by a further homotopy pullback
A^ ⟶ Ω 1(−,Lie(A)) ↓  (pb) ↓ A ⟶θ A ♭ dRΣA ↓  (pb) ↓ Π(A) ⟶ Π(A/♭A).
  \array{
    \widehat{A} &\longrightarrow& \Omega^1(-,Lie(A))
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    A &\stackrel{\theta_A}{\longrightarrow}& \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{(pb)}& \downarrow
    \\
    \Pi(A) &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A/\flat A)
  }
  \,.


But of course by the generality of the above proposition, such an A^\widehat{A} sits itself again in its fracture-like pullback diagram.

Dually:

Proposition
For every A∈T *HA \in T_\ast \mathbf{H} the naturality square
♭(Π dRΣ −1A) ⟶ Π dR(Σ −1A) ↓  ↓ ♭A ⟶ A
  \array{
    \flat(\Pi_{dR} \Sigma^{-1} A) &\longrightarrow & \Pi_{dR}(\Sigma^{-1} A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A 
  }


(of the flat modality applied to the homotopy fiber of the unit of the shape modality) is an (∞,1)-pullback square.


Proof
As before but dually, the diagram extends to a morphism of homotopy cofiber diagrams of the form
♭(Π dRΣ −1A) ⟶ Π dR(ΩA) ↓  ↓ ♭A ⟶ A ↓  ↓ ♭Π(A) ⟶≃ Π(A),
  \array{
    \flat(\Pi_{dR} \Sigma^{-1} A) &\longrightarrow & \Pi_{dR}(\Omega A)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \flat A &\stackrel{}{\longrightarrow}& A 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow 
    \\
    \flat \Pi(A) &\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}& \Pi(A) 
  }
  \,,


and by cohesion the bottom horizontal morphism is an equivalence.

Combining these two statements yields the following (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13).

Corollary
For H\mathbf{H} a cohesive (∞,1)-topos every stable homotopy type A∈Stab(H)↪THA \in Stab(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow T \mathbf{H} sits inside a diagram of the form
  Π dRΩA  ⟶  ♭ dRΣA  ↗  ↘  ↗ θ A  ↘ ♭Π dRΩA    A    Π♭ dRΣA  ↘  ↗  ↘  ↗ Πθ A   ♭A  ⟶  ΠA,
  \array{
    &&  \Pi_{dR} \Omega A && \longrightarrow && \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow & & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\theta_A}} && \searrow
    \\
    \flat \Pi_{dR} \Omega A  && && A && && \Pi \flat_{dR}\Sigma A
    \\
    & \searrow &  & \nearrow & & \searrow && \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\Pi \theta_A}}
    \\
    && \flat A && \longrightarrow && \Pi A
  }
  \,,


where the two squares are homotopy pullback squares and the two diagonals are the fiber sequences of the Maurer-Cartan form θ A\theta_A and its dual.


Remark
The bottom horizontal morphisms in the diagram in prop.  are the canonical points-to-pieces transform.


Remark
This kind of diagram under forming π 0\pi_0 has been traditionally known from ordinary differential cohomology and from differential K-theory, and had been used in proposals to axiomatize differential cohomology, see for instance (Bunke 12, prop. 4.57) and see at differential cohomology diagram. Here we see that this holds fully generally for every stable cohesive homotopy type. If one still regards this diagram as characteristic of “differential” refinement it hence exhibits every cohesive stable type as a coefficients of some differential cohomology theory. This is a strong version of the synthetic notion “differential cohomology in a cohesive topos” . For more on this see also at smooth spectrum.

In abstract generality, a differential cohomology diagram is the hexagonal diagram in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos formed by the two fracture squares of the unit and counit of, respectively, the shape modality Π\Pi and the flat modality ♭\flat. The exactness properties of this diagram for any stable homotopy type E^\hat E in the corresponding tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos express E^\hat E as being the coefficients for a differential cohomology refinement by differential form data ♭ dRE^\flat_{dR} \hat E of the generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory which is represented by the shape spectrum E≔Π(E^)E \coloneqq \Pi(\hat E).
Historically, it had been shown in (Simons-Sullivan 07) for ordinary differential cohomology and in (Freed-Lott 10, Simons-Sullivan 08) for differential K-theory that these cohomology theories are characterized as sitting in the middle of a hexagonal diagram of interlocking exact sequences of cohomology groups, which expresses, on the one hand, how every differential cohomology class has underlying it a non-differential cohomology class (“of a principal ∞-bundle”) as well as a curvature differential form datum, and, on the other hand, how the special cases of trivial underlying classes equipped with differential form datum and of flat differential form data sit inside the differential cohomology classes.
At this schematic conceptual level a differential cohomology diagram looks as follows (where all unlabelled arrows are meant to be read as “evident inclusions”);

One characteristic property is that the two outer sequences are exact sequences. This expresses (at this rough schematic level) for instance (for the upper part) that the connections AA on trivial bundles whose curvature vanishes in that dA=0\mathbf{d}A = 0, are exactly the flat connections; as well as (for the lower part) that bundles with flat connections have torsion Chern-clases.
So a differential cohomology theory would be one whose cocycles/cohomology classes have the interpretation of (stable) principal ∞-bundles with connection such as in the middle of this diagram.
The characterization/construction of differential cohomology via homotopy fiber products (of mapping spectra with differential form data) due to (Hopkins-Singer 02) provides an incarnation of this kind of diagram genuinely in stable homotopy theory, so that the outer parts are indeed homotopy fiber sequences and the two squares are homotopy cartesian (are homotopy pullbacks/homotopy pushouts).
In (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13) it was observed (see Schreiber 13, section 4.1.2 for the generality in which we present this here) that every stable homotopy type E^\hat E in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} canonically sits inside a diagram of this form, being formed from the fracture squares of the units and counits of the shape modality Π\Pi and the flat modality ♭\flat, which in the right part are interpreted as the Maurer-Cartan form θ E\theta_E and the Chern character ch Ech_E:
  Π dRE^  ⟶d  ♭ dRE^  ↗  ↘  ↗ θ E^  ↘ Π dR♭E^    E^    Π♭ dRE^  ↘  ↗  ↘  ↗ ch E   ♭E^  ⟶  ΠE^.

This is theorem  below.
For the special case that H=TSmooth∞Grpd\mathbf{H} = T Smooth\infty Grpd is the tangent (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids (∞-stacks over the site of smooth manifolds) this subsumes the cases mentioned above. But there are many examples of cohomology theories not of the form of (Hopkins-Singer 02) but represented by stable homotopy types in a cohesive (∞,1)-topos (see Schreiber 13, BunkeNikolausVölkl 13) and hence fitting into such a diagram, where the interpretation of the pieces of the diagram is just as it should be.
Therefore it makes sense to define generally that a differential cohomology diagram is the above combined fracture squares with its outer homotopy fiber sequences for shape modality and flat modality in any cohesive (∞,1)-topos.
A cohesive (∞,1)-topos is a context of ∞-groupoids that are equipped with a geometric notion of cohesion on their collections of objects and k-morphisms, for instance topological cohesion or smooth cohesion.
While the axioms of cohesion do imply the intrinsic existence of exponentiated infinitesimal spaces, they do not admit access to an explicit synthetic notion of infinitesimal extension.
Here we consider one extra axiom on a cohesive (∞,1)-topos that does imply a good intrinsic notion of synthetic differential extension, compatible with the given notion of cohesion. We speak of differential cohesion.
In a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos with differential cohesion there are for instance good intrinsic notions of formal smoothness and of de Rham spaces of objects.
In a context of synthetic differential geometry/differential cohesion the reduction modality characterizes reduced objects. It forms itself the left adjoint in an adjoint modality with the infinitesimal shape modality.

Here ℜ\Re is the reduction modality. The reflective subcategory that it defines is that of reduced objects.
In a context of differential cohesion the infinitesimal shape modality, crystalline modality or étale modality ℑ\Im  characterizes coreduced objects. It is itself the right adjoint in an adjoint modality with the reduction modality and the left adjoint in an adjoint modality with the infinitesimal flat modality.

Relation for formally étale morphisms
The modal types of ℑ\Im  in the context of some XX, i.e. those (Y→X)∈H /X(Y\to X) \in \mathbf{H}_{/X} for which the naturality square of the ℑ\Im -unit

  \array{
     Y &\longrightarrow& \Im Y

     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\longrightarrow& \Im X
  }


is a (homotopy) pullback square, are the formally étale morphisms Y→XY \to X.
Relation to de Rham spaces
For XX a geometric homotopy type, the result of applying the infinitesimal shape modality yields a type ℑX \Im X which has the interpretation of the de Rham space of XX. See there for more.
Relation to jet bundles
For any object XX in differential cohesion, the base change comonad Jet≔i *i *Jet \coloneqq i^\ast i_\ast along the unit i:X→ℑXi \colon X \to \Im X has the interpretation of being the jet comonad which sends bundles over XX to their jet bundles.
Relation to crystalline cohomology
The cohomology of ℑX\Im X has the interpretation of crystalline cohomology of XX. See there for more.
In a context of synthetic differential geometry/differential cohesion the infinitesimal flat modality is the right adjoint in an adjoint modality with the infinitesimal shape modality.

Relation to crystalline cohomology
For AA a geometric homotopy type, &A\& A  is the coefficient for crystalline cohomology with coefficients in AA. See there for more.
In a context of synthetic differential geometry/differential cohesion a reduced object is one “without purely infinitesimal extension”.
For instance in the context of formal schemes/formal smooth manifolds the reduced objects are the genuine schemes and the genuine smooth manifold, those without formal extension.
Accordingly, an anti-reduced object is one consisting entirely of infinitesimal extension, hence is an infinitesimally thickened point.
Beware that reduced objects in general do “contain infinitesimals in between their classical points”, in that not every map from an anti-reduced object into them is necessarily constant. The objects “without any infinitesimals” in the sense that all such maps are constant are instead the coreduced objects.

A reduced object or reduced type is one in the full subcategory defined by the leftmost modality ℜ\Re.
In smooth differential geometry
Consider the Cahiers topos
H=Sh({ℝ n×Spec(W)} n,W)
  \mathbf{H} = Sh(\{\mathbb{R}^n \times Spec(W)\}_{n,W})


as a model of synthetic differential geometry/differential cohesion (where WW denotes Weil algebras/Artin algebras). The sub-topos of reduced obects
H reduced↪H
  \mathbf{H}_{reduced} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}


is the topos of smooth spaces
H reduced=Sh({ℝ n}).
  \mathbf{H}_{reduced} = Sh(\{\mathbb{R}^n\})
  \,.


An object D∈HD \in \mathbf{H} with is an anti-reduced object, hence whose reduction coreflection is the terminal object, ℜ(D)≃*\Re(D) \simeq   \ast  is an infinitesimally thickened point.
For instance the formal dual D 1=Spec(ℝ[ϵ](ϵ 2))D^1 = Spec(\mathbb{R}[\epsilon](\epsilon^2)) of the ring of dual numbers is such that its reduction is the point ℜ(D)≃*\Re(D) \simeq \ast.
Under Yoneda embedding every smooth manifold is in H reduced\mathbf{H}_{reduced} and is hence a reduced object in H\mathbf{H}. More generally there are formal smooth manifolds in H\mathbf{H} and they are generally not reduced.
For example for Σ∈SmoothMfd↪H reduced↪H\Sigma \in SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}_{reduced}\hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} an ordinary smooth manifold (hence reduced) the object
Σ×D 1∈H
  \Sigma \times D^1 \in \mathbf{H}


is a formal smooth manifold which is not reduced. It reduction is
ℜ(Σ×D 1)≃Σ.
  \Re(\Sigma\times D^1) \simeq \Sigma
  \,.


In particular the real line which is the smooth line object of the smooth topos H\mathbf{H}
ℝ 1∈H reduced↪H
  \mathbb{R}^1 \in \mathbf{H}_{reduced}\hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}


is reduced, ℜ(ℝ)≃ℝ\Re(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}.
Observe from these examples that reduced objects do “contain infinitesimal points in between their classical points”, which just means that there are non-constant morphisms of the form
D⟶Σ.
  D \longrightarrow \Sigma
  \,.


Contrast between reduced and coreduced objects
The objects X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} for which all maps out of anti-reduced objects DD are constant maps are instead the coreduced objects.
The coreduced objects are the ones with “no infinitesimal behavior”, and the reduced objects are the ones “whose infinitesimal behavior is determined by their non-infinitesimal behavior”. A reduced object does contain infinitesimal points; what it lacks are “purely infinitesimal directions” while a coreduced object has no infinitesimal points.
In algebraic geometry
A reduced scheme is one all whose local rings of functions have no non-zero nilpotent elements.
In a context of synthetic differential geometry/differential cohesion a coreduced object is one all whose infinitesimal paths are constant. Compare the discrete objects, in which all paths are constant, meaning all discrete objects are also coreduced.

A coreduced object or coreduced type is one in the full subcategory defined by the infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im or equivalently the infinitesimal flat modality &\&.
Note that an object XX being coreduced is the same as it being formally etale.
A context of differential cohesion is determined by the existence of an adjoint triple of modalities

An object/type XX is called formally smooth if the unit
X→ℑX
  X \to \Im X


is a 1-epimorphism. This is equivalent to the essentially unique morphism X→*X \to * to the terminal object being a formally smooth morphism.
The concept of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid or super smooth geometric homotopy type is the combination of super ∞-groupoid and smooth ∞-groupoid. The cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth super-∞\infty-groupoids is a context that realizes higher supergeometry.
Super smooth ∞\infty-groupoids include supermanifolds, super Lie groups and their deloopings etc. Under Lie differentiation these map to super L-∞ algebras.
We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at smooth super infinity-groupoid.

Definition
Write


CartSp for the site of Cartesian spaces;


InfPoint≔WAlg opInfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op} for the category of first-order infinitesimally thickened points (i.e. the formal duals of commutative algebras over the real numbers of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R}\oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional square-0 nilpotent ideal).


SuperPoint≔WAlg super opSuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op} for the category of superpoints, by which we here mean the formal duals to commutative superalgebras which are super-Weil algebras.


There are then “semidirect product” sites CartSp⋊InfinPointCartSp \rtimes InfinPoint and CartSp⋊SuperPointCartSp \rtimes SuperPoint (whose objects are Cartesian products of the given form inside synthetic differential supergeometry and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).
Set then
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊InfPoint)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)


for the collection of formal smooth ∞-groupoids (see there) and finally
SuperSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊SuperPoint)
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)


for that of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid

Here


the first inclusion picks the terminal object ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0;


the second inclusion is that of reduced objects; the coreflection is reduction, sending an algebra to its reduced algebra;


the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at superalgebra – Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras.




Remark
Passing to (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves, this yields, via (∞,1)-Kan extension, a sequence of adjoint quadruples as follows:

  }



Proposition
Passing to the adjoint triples of idempotent monads and idempotent comonads which this induces, then yields


on the left the shape modality ∫\int, flat modality ♭\flat and sharp modality ♯\sharp,


in the middle yields the reduction modality ℜ\Re, the infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im and the infinitesimal flat modality &\&.


on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit ⇝\rightsquigarrow is the bosonic modality and whose left piece ⇉\rightrightarrows produces super-even components, containing all the “fermion currents” if one wishes , which in this unity of opposites hence deserves to be called the fermionic modality. The further right adjoint RhRh is the rheonomy modality.


Hence we get a process of adjoint modalities of the form
  id ⊣ id   ∨  ∨  fermionic ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosonic   ⊥  ⊥  bosonic ⇝ ⊣ Rh rheonomic   ∨  ∨  reduced ℜ ⊣ ℑ infinitesimal   ⊥  ⊥  infinitesimal ℑ ⊣ & étale   ∨  ∨  contractible ʃ ⊣ ♭ discrete   ⊥  ⊥  discrete ♭ ⊣ ♯ differential   ∨  ∨   ∅ ⊣ *
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\

    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }


where “∨\vee” denotes inclusion of modal types. The first level is cohesion, the second is differential cohesion (elasticity), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further “square roots” of all infinitesimal generators.


Proof
All the sites are ∞-cohesive sites, which gives that we have an cohesive (infinity,1)-topos. The composite inclusion on the right is an ∞-cohesive neighbourhood site, whence the inclusion Smooth∞Gpd↪SuperFormalSmooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd exhibits differential cohesion.
With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the Aufhebung of ℜ⊣ℑ\Re \dashv \Im by ⇝⊣Rh\rightsquigarrow \dashv Rh and the further opposition ⇉⊣⇝\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow.

On super smooth infinity-groupoids there is a modal operator (−)⇝\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{(-)} which projects onto the bosonic components of the supergeometry. On formal dual superalgebras this is given by passing to the body. In terms of physical fields this is the projection onto boson fields, which are hence the modal types of ⇝\rightsquigarrow, and so it makes sense to speak of the bosonic modality.
This has a left adjoint ⇉\rightrightarrows (which on superalgebras passes to the even-graded sub-algebra) and hence together these form an adjoint modality which may be thought of as characterizing the supergeometry. See at super smooth infinity-groupoid – Cohesion. With ⇉\rightrightarrows being opposite to ⇝\rightsquigarrow thereby, it makes sense to call it the fermionic modality.
Notice that the fermionic currents in physics (e.g. the electron density current) are indeed fermionic bilinears, i.e. are indeed in the even subalgebras of the underlying superalgebra.

  \array{

Since the crucial extra structures carried by an orbifold are


geometric structure (e.g. topological, algebro-geometric, differential-geometric, super-geometric, etc.)


singularities


the cohomology of orbifolds should be such as to provide invariants which are sensitive not just to the underlying plain homotopy type of an orbifold (its shape) but also to this extra structure. This means that orbifold cohomology should, respectively, unify


geometric cohomology (e.g. sheaf hypercohomology, differential cohomology, etc.)


equivariant cohomology in its fine form of Bredon cohomology


in the sense that geometric cohomology is recovered away from the orbifold singularities and equivariant cohomology is recovered right at the singularities, while globally orbifold cohomology provides a unification of these two aspects.
Since any concept of cohomology (as discussed there) is effectively equivalent to the choice of ambient (∞,1)-topos, the question of defining orbifold cohomology is closely related to the question of how exactly to define the (∞,1)-category of orbifolds (usually a (2,1)-category) in the first place. This question is notoriously more subtle than the simple intuitive idea of orbifolds might suggest, as witnessed by the convoluted history of the concept (see e.g. Lerman 08, Introduction).

Deficiency of orbifolds as geometric groupoids
A proposal popular among Lie theorists (Moerdijk-Pronk 97) is to regard an orbifold with local charts U i∈G iActionsU_i \in G_i Actions (actions of some group on some local model space) as the geometric stack obtained by gluing the corresponding homotopy quotients/quotient stacks U i⫽G iU_i \!\sslash \!G_i. If H\mathbf{H} is the ambient cohesive (∞,1)-topos in which this takes place (for instance H=\mathbf{H} =  Smooth∞Groupoids, SuperFormalSmooth∞Groupoids, etc.) and if G∈Grp↪DiscGrp(H)G \in Grp \overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} Grp(\mathbf{H}) is a discrete group in which all the isotropy groups of the orbifold are contained, this gives an object
(𝒳 ↓ faith BG faith)∈(H /BG) ≤0↪H /BG
  \left(
  \array{
    \mathcal{X}
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{faith}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \phantom{{}^{faith}}
  \right)
  \;\in\;
  \left( 
    \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \right)_{\leq 0}
  \hookrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}


in the slice (∞,1)-topos over the delooping BG=*⫽G\mathbf{B}G = \ast \sslash G of GG, which is still a 0-truncated object, reflecting that as a functor of groupoids the morphism 𝒳→BG\mathcal{X} \to \mathbf{B}G is a faithful functor.
Accordingly, if this is – or were – the correct formalization of the nature of orbifolds 𝒳\mathcal{X}, then the corresponding orbifold cohomology has coefficients given by objects 𝒜∈H /BG\mathcal{A} \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G} and cohomology sets being the connected components of the (∞,1)-categorical hom-spaces
H BG(𝒳,𝒜)≔π 0H /BG(𝒳,𝒜).
  H_{\mathbf{B}G}\big( \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{A}\big)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  \pi_0 \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}\big( \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{A}\big)
  \,.


This concept of orbifold cohomology does fully reflect the geometric nature of orbifolds. It also reflects some equivariance aspect. For example if 𝒳=*⫽G\mathcal{X} = \ast \sslash G is the one-point orbifold with singularity given by a finite group GG, and if V∈GRepresentationsV \in G Representations is a linear representation, with K(V,n)⫽G∈∞Groupoids /BG↪DiscH /BGK(V,n)\sslash G \in \infty Groupoids_{/\mathbf{B}G} \overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G} its Eilenberg-MacLane space, then
H BG(BG,K(V,n)⫽G)≃H grp n(G,V)
  H_{\mathbf{B}G}\big( 
    \mathbf{B}G, K(V,n)\sslash G
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  H^n_{grp}(G,V)


is the group cohomology of GG with coefficients in VV.
However, this definition does not reflect Bredon-equivariant cohomology around the orbifold singularities. Instead, it really given (geometric/stacky refinement) of cohomology with local coefficients.
\,
Lift of orbifolds to singular-cohesive homotopy theory
Hence the proposal of Moerdijk-Pronk 97, that an orbifold should be regarded as a certain geometric stack, is missing something. It was briefly suggested in Schwede 17, Introduction, Schwede 18, p. ix-x that the missing aspect is provided by global equivariant homotopy theory, but details seem to have been left open.
Here we discuss how to define the required orbifold cohomology in detail and in general. We combine the differential cohesion for the geometric aspect with the cohesion of global equivariant homotopy theory that was observed and highlighted in Rezk 14.
The following may serve as intuition for the issue with the nature of orbifolds:
Envision the picture of an orbifold singularity and hold a mathemagical magnifying glass over the singular point. Under this magnification you can see resolved the singular point as a fuzzy fattened point, to be called 𝔹G\mathbb{B}G.
Removing the magnifying glass, what one sees with the bare eye depends on how one squints:


The physicist says that what he sees is a singular point, but a point after all. This is the plain quotient *=*/G\ast = \ast / G.


The Lie geometer says that what she sees is a point transforming under the GG-action that fixes it, hence the homotopy quotient groupoid BG=*⫽G\mathbf{B}G =\ast \sslash G.


These are two opposite extreme aspects of the orbifold singularity 𝔹G\mathbb{B}G, but the orbifold singularity itself is more than both of these aspects. The real nature of an orbifold singularity is in fact a point, not a big classifying space BG\mathbf{B} G (recall that already Bℤ 2=ℝP ∞\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2 = \mathbb{R}P^\infty), but it is a point that also remembers the group action, for that characterizes how the singularity is being singular:
  orbifold singularity𝔹G   <↙ Aopposite extremeaspects of orbifold singularity ↘ ⊂ plain quotient*=*/G    homotopy quotientBG=*⫽G
   \array{
       && 
       { \text{orbifold singularity} \atop {\mathbb{B}G} }

     &&
     &&

   }


This “unity of opposites” may be captured by the modalities on the singular-cohesive

A smooth algebra or C ∞C^\infty-ring is an algebra AA over the reals ℝ\mathbb{R} for which not only the product operation ⋅:ℝ×ℝ→ℝ\cdot : \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} lifts to the algebra product A×A→AA \times A \to A, but for which every smooth map f:ℝ n→ℝ mf : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m (morphism in Diff) lifts to a map A(f):A n→A mA(f) : A^n \to A^m in a compatible way.
In short this means that AA is


a product-preserving co-presheaf on CartSp;


equivalently: an algebra for the Lawvere theory CartSp;


The smoothness of such C ∞C^\infty-rings is witnessed by the fact that this Lawvere theory is even a Fermat theory.
The opposite category of the category of C ∞C^\infty-rings is the category of smooth loci. This and its subcategories play a major role as sites for categories of sheaves that serve as models for synthetic differential geometry.
Limits and colimits

Proposition
All limits and all directed colimits in C ∞RingC^\infty Ring are computed objectwise in [CartSp,Set][CartSp,Set] as limits in Set.


Proof
As discussed at limits and colimits by example, all limits and colimits in [CartSp,Set][CartSp,Set] are computed objectwise, so the remaining question is if they preserve the property of functors CartSp→SetCartSp \to Set to preserved products. The claim follows from the observation that limits and directed colimits do commute with products.

See also MSIA, p. 22.
The underlying ordinary algebra
There is a forgetful functor
U:C ∞Alg→Alg
  U : C^\infty Alg \to Alg


from generalized smooth algebras to ordinary algebras which is given by evaluation on ℝ\mathbb{R}
U:A↦A(ℝ)
  U : A \mapsto A(\mathbb{R})


and equipping the set A(ℝ)A(\mathbb{R}) with the algebra structure induced on it:
the product and sum on A(ℝ)A(\mathbb{R}) is the image of the corresponding operations on the algebra ℝ\mathbb{R}
⋅ A:A(ℝ)×A(ℝ)→≃A(ℝ×ℝ)→A(⋅)A(ℝ).
  \cdot_A 
  :
  A(\mathbb{R}) \times A(\mathbb{R})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  A(\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R})
  \stackrel{A(\cdot)}{\to}
  A(\mathbb{R})
  \,.


+ A:A(ℝ)×A(ℝ)→≃A(ℝ+ℝ)→A(⋅)A(ℝ).
  +_A :
  A(\mathbb{R}) \times A(\mathbb{R})
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  A(\mathbb{R} + \mathbb{R})
  \stackrel{A(\cdot)}{\to}
  A(\mathbb{R})
  \,.


Moreover there is canonically a morphism of rings
ℝ→A(ℝ)
  \mathbb{R} \to A(\mathbb{R})


given by
(*=ℝ 0→cℝ)↦(*=A(ℝ 0)→A(c)A(ℝ)).
  (* = \mathbb{R}^0 \stackrel{c}{\to} \mathbb{R})
  \mapsto
  (* = A(\mathbb{R}^0) \stackrel{A(c)}{\to} A(\mathbb{R}))
  \,.


This makes A(ℝ)A(\mathbb{R}) an ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra.

Proposition
The forgetful functor UU fits into an adjunction
(F⊣U):C ∞Alg ℝ→U←FAlg ℝ.
  (F \dashv U)
  :
  C^\infty Alg_{\mathbb{R}}
  \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{U}{\to}}
  Alg_{\mathbb{R}}
  \,.



Proof
This statement may be understood as a special case of the following more general statement:

If SS, TT are finitary monads and f:S→Tf: S \to T is a monad morphism, then the relative forgetful functorf *:Alg T→Alg S,f^*: Alg_T \to Alg_S,
which pulls back a TT-algebra ξ:TX→X\xi: T X \to X to the SS-algebra ξ∘fX:SX→X\xi \circ f X: S X \to X, admits a left adjoint.


(In the case under discussion, SS is the free algebra monad on SetSet, TT is the free smooth algebra monad, and f:S→Tf: S \to T is induced from the obvious inclusion f(n):S(n)→T(n)f(n): S(n) \to T(n) which interprets an nn-ary algebra operation (in the theory Th STh_S) as a smooth operation in the theory Th TTh_T. See finitary monad for discussion on the connection between finitary monads TT and Lawvere theories Th TTh_T.)
The desired left adjoint f !f_! takes an algebra θ:SX→X\theta: S X \to X to the reflexive coequalizer exhibited as a diagram
TSX→Tθ→(μ T∘Tf)XTX→πT⊗ SXT S X \stackrel{\overset{(\mu_T \circ T f)X}{\to}}{\underset{T\theta}{\to}} T X \stackrel{\pi}{\to} T \otimes_S X
in the category of TT-algebras, where μ T:TT→T\mu_T: T T \to T is the monad multiplication. The coequalizer is denoted T⊗ SXT \otimes_S X to emphasize the analogy with pushing forward SS-modules XX along a ring homomorphism f:S→Tf: S \to T to get TT-modules; the proof below is an arrow-theoretic transcription of the usual proof of the adjunction between pushing forward and pulling back in the context of rings and modules.
A finitary monad TT preserves reflexive coequalizers, so that there is a canonical isomorphism
T(T⊗ SX)≅(TT)⊗ SXT(T \otimes_S X) \cong (T T) \otimes_S X
It follows that TT-algebra (TT-module) maps g¯:T⊗ SX→Y\bar{g}: T \otimes_S X \to Y, i.e., maps that render commutative the diagram
TT⊗ SX →Tg¯ TY μ⊗ SX↓  ↓ξ T⊗ SX →g¯ Y\array{
T T \otimes_S X & \stackrel{T\bar{g}}{\to} & T Y \\
\mu \otimes_S X \downarrow & & \downarrow \xi \\
T \otimes_S X & \underset{\bar{g}}{\to} & Y
}

are in bijection with maps g:TX→Yg: T X \to Y that render commutative
TTX →Tg TY μ↓  ↓ξ TX →g Y\array{
T T X & \stackrel{T g}{\to} & T Y \\
\mu \downarrow & & \downarrow \xi \\
T X & \underset{g}{\to} & Y
}

(that is to say, TT-algebra maps g:TX→Yg: T X \to Y) which additionally coequalize the parallel pair in the diagram
TSX→Tθ→(μ T∘Tf)XTX→gYT S X \stackrel{\overset{(\mu_T \circ T f)X}{\to}}{\underset{T\theta}{\to}} T X \stackrel{g}{\to} Y
Since f:S→Tf: S \to T is a monad morphism, we have commutativity of parallel squares in
TSX →Tθ→(μ T∘Tf)X TX →g Y fSX↑  ↑fX   SSX →Sθ→μ SX SX\array{
T S X & \stackrel{\overset{(\mu_T \circ T f)X}{\to}}{\underset{T\theta}{\to}} & T X & \stackrel{g}{\to} & Y \\
f S X \uparrow & & \uparrow f X & & \\
S S X & \stackrel{\overset{\mu_S X}{\to}}{\underset{S \theta}{\to}} & S X
}

so that g∘fXg \circ f X coequalizes the bottom pair. However, because g:TX→Yg: T X \to Y is a TT-algebra map, its pullback g∘fX:SX→Yg \circ f X: S X \to Y defines an SS-algebra map SX→f *YS X \to f^* Y. This SS-algebra map g∘fXg \circ f X factors through the coequalizer of the bottom pair of maps in Alg SAlg_S, i.e., factors uniquely through an SS-algebra map X→f *YX \to f^*Y. This establishes the adjunction f !⊣f *f_! \dashv f^*.

Finitely presented C ∞C^\infty-rings

Proposition (MSIA, prop. 1.1)
C ∞(ℝ n)C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n) is the free smooth algebra on nn generators, in that for every n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and every smooth algebra AA there is an adjunction isomorphism
Hom C ∞Alg(C ∞(ℝ n),A)≃Hom Alg(ℝ[x 1,...,x n],A(ℝ)).
  Hom_{C^\infty Alg}(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n), A)
  \simeq
  Hom_{Alg}(\mathbb{R}[x_1,...,x_n], A(\mathbb{R}))
  \,.



Every finitely presented C ∞C^\infty-ring is fair/germ determined.

We have a chain of inclusions


finitely presented C ∞C^\infty-rings


⊂\subset “good” C ∞C^\infty-rings


⊂\subset fair C ∞C^\infty-rings


⊂\subset finitely generated C ∞C^\infty-rings


Points of smooth loci
An ℝ\mathbb{R}-point of a C ∞C^\infty-ring CC is a point *→𝕃(C)* \to \mathbb{L}(C) of the corresponding smooth locus, i.e. a morphism C→ℝ≅C ∞(*)C \to \mathbb{R} \cong C^\infty(*).

Proposition
Points of a C ∞C^\infty-ring are in bijection with points of the underlying ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra U(C)U(C), i.e. with ordinary ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra morphisms U(C)→ℝU(C) \to \mathbb{R}.

In particular every Weil algebra WW has a unique point *→𝕃(W)* \to \mathbb{L}(W): every Weil algebra is the algebra of functions on an infinitesimal thickening of an ordinary point.
By the properties of C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) for XX a smooth manifold discussed below, the ℝ\mathbb{R}-points of C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) are precisely the ordinary points of the manifold XX.
Smooth function algebras on smooth manifolds

Proposition (MSIA, prop. 2.5, 2.6 )
Let f:X→Zf : X \to Z and g:Y→Zg : Y \to Z be transversal maps of smooth manifolds. Then the functor C ∞(−)C^\infty(-) sends the pullback
X× ZY → X ↓  ↓ f Y →g Z
  \array{
    X \times_Z Y &\to& X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^f
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{g}{\to}& Z
  }


to the pushout
C ∞(X)⊗ C ∞(Z)C ∞(Y)=: C ∞(X× ZY) ← C ∞(X)  ↑  ↑ f *  C ∞(Y) ←g * C ∞(Z)
  \array{
    C^\infty(X) \otimes_{C^\infty(Z)} C^\infty(Y)
    =: & C^\infty(X \times_Z Y) &\leftarrow& C^\infty(X)
    \\
    & \uparrow && \uparrow^{f^*}
    \\
    & C^\infty(Y) &\stackrel{g^*}{\leftarrow}& C^\infty(Z)
  }


In particular this implies (for Z=*Z = {*})that the the smooth tensor product of functions on XX and YY is the algebra of functions on the product X×YX \times Y:
C ∞(X×Y)≃C ∞(X)⊗ ∞C ∞(Y).
  C^\infty(X \times Y) \simeq C^\infty(X) \otimes_\infty C^\infty(Y)
  \,.



Remark
The ordinary algebraic tensor product of C ∞(X)(ℝ)C^\infty(X)(\mathbb{R}) and C ∞(Y)(ℝ)C^\infty(Y)(\mathbb{R}) regarded as ordinary algebras does not in general satisfy this property. Rather one has an inclusion
C ∞(X)(ℝ)⊗C ∞(Y)(ℝ)⊂C ∞(X×Y)(ℝ).
  C^\infty(X)(\mathbb{R}) \otimes C^\infty(Y)(\mathbb{R})
  \subset
  C^\infty(X \times Y)(\mathbb{R})
  \,.



Remark
In the context of geometric function theory the corresponding general statement (without the transversality condition) says that C ∞(X)C^\infty(X) is a “good” kind of function. The above equation is one sub-aspect of the one of the fundamental theorems of geometric infinity-function theory.

Turning this inclusion into an equivalence is usually called a completion of the algebraic tensor product. Therefore we see:

The smooth tensor product is automatically the completed tensor product.

In summary this yields the following characterization of smooth function algebras on manifolds.

Theorem (MSIA, theorem 2.8)
The functor C ∞(−)=Hom Diff(−,−):Diff→C ∞AlgC^\infty(-) = Hom_{Diff}(-,-) : Diff \to C^\infty Alg


is a full and faithful functor


takes values in finitely presented smooth C ∞C^\infty-algebras


sends transversal pullbacks to coproducts (and hence to the smooth tensor product).



A smooth locus is the formal dual of a finitely generated smooth algebra (or C ∞C^\infty-ring):
a space that behaves as if its algebra of functions is a finitely generated smooth algebra.
Given that a smooth algebra is a smooth refinement of an ordinary ring with a morphism from ℝ\mathbb{R}, a smooth locus is the analog in well-adapted models for synthetic differential geometry for what in algebraic geometry is an affine variety over ℝ\mathbb{R}.
A finitely generated smooth algebra is one of the form C ∞(ℝ n)/JC^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n)/J, for JJ an ideal of the ordinary underlying algebra.
Write C ∞Ring finC^\infty Ring^{fin} for the category of finitely generated smooth algebras.
Then the opposite category 𝕃:=(C ∞Ring fin) op\mathbb{L} := (C^\infty Ring^{fin})^{op} is the category of smooth loci.
Notation
For A∈C ∞Ring finA \in C^\infty Ring^{fin} one write ℓA\ell A for the corresponding object in 𝕃\mathbb{L}.
Often one also write
R:=ℓC ∞(ℝ)
  R := \ell C^\infty(\mathbb{R})


for the real line regarded as an object of 𝕃\mathbb{L}.
The category 𝕃\mathbb{L} has the following properties:

Proposition
The canonical inclusion functor
SmthMfd↪𝕃
  SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbb{L}

X↦ℓC ∞(X)
  X \mapsto \ell C^\infty(X)


from the category SmthMfd of smooth manifolds is a full subcategory embedding (i.e. a full and faithful functor. Moreover, it preserves pullbacks along transversal maps.


Proposition
The Tietze extension theorem holds in 𝕃\mathbb{L}: RR-valued functions on closed subobjects in 𝕃\mathbb{L} have an extension.

A ‘Fermat theory’ is a Lawvere theory that extends the usual theory of commutative rings by permitting differentiation.
The term Fermat theory seems to have been introduced in (Kock 09) based on (Dubuc-Kock 84). But as the name suggests, it has its roots in an old observation of Fermat. Namely: if f:ℝ⟶ℝf \;\colon\; \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} is a polynomial function, then
f(x+y)=f(x)+yf˜(x,y)f (x+y) = f(x) + y \tilde{f}(x,y) 
for a unique polynomial function f˜:ℝ 2→ℝ\tilde{f} \colon \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}. Clearly
f˜(x,y)=f(x+y)−f(x)y \tilde{f}(x,y) = \frac{f(x+y) - f(x)}{y} 
for y≠0y \ne 0, but the interesting thing is that
f˜(x,0)=f′(x)\tilde{f}(x,0) = f'(x)
So, the function f˜\tilde{f} knows about the derivative of ff! (This can be done for polynomials over any commutative ring, although Fermat wasn't working in that generality.)
Later Jacques Hadamard generalized this observation from a polynomial function ff to a continuously differentiable function ff, where now f˜\tilde{f} is unique if required to be continuous. This is the statement of the Hadamard lemma. (For a merely differentiable function ff, require f˜\tilde{f} to be continuous in yy alone.) The function f˜\tilde{f} is thus called a Hadamard quotient. If f˜\tilde{f} is to be the same class of function as ff, then we need smooth functions, and that will be our motivating context from now on.
If we take f˜(x,0)=f′(x)\tilde{f}(x,0) = f'(x) as a definition of the derivative, we can derive many of the basic rules for derivatives from the formula
f(x+y)=f(x)+yf˜(x,y)f(x+y) = f(x) + y \tilde{f}(x,y) 
using just algebra — no limits! As an exercise, the reader should check these rules:
(f+g)′=f′+g′(f + g)' = f' + g'
(fg)′=f′g+fg′(f g)' = f' g + f g' 
(f∘g)′=(f′∘g)g′(f \circ g)' = (f' \circ g) g' 
These ideas continue to work if ff is a smooth function from ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n to ℝ\mathbb{R}; focussing on one variable and treating the others as parameter?s, we have partial differentiation.
The above observations suggest defining the following kind of Lawvere theory. A Fermat theory is an extension of the algebraic theory of commutative rings, such that for any (n+1)(n+1)-ary operation ff there is a unique (n+2)(n+2)-ary operation f˜\tilde{f} such that
f(x+y,z→)=f(x,z→)+yf˜(x,y,z→) f(x + y, \vec{z}) =
f(x, \vec{z}) + y \tilde{f}(x,y,\vec{z})

where z→\vec{z} is a list of nn variables which act as parameters. (Here we are abusing language by writing the operations ff and f˜\tilde{f} as if they were functions, to avoid unintuitive commutative diagrams.)
The Cahier topos is a cohesive topos that constitutes a well-adapted model for synthetic differential geometry (a “smooth topos”).
It is the sheaf topos on the site FormalCartSp of infinitesimally thickened Cartesian spaces.

Definition
Let FormalCartSp be the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on those of the form
ℝ n×ℓW,
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \ell W
  \,,


consisting of a product of a Cartesian space with an infinitesimally thickened point, i.e. a formal dual of a Weil algebra .
Dually, the opposite category is the full subcategory FormalCartSp op↪SmoothAlgFormalCartSp^{op} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg of smooth algebras on those of the form
C ∞(ℝ k×ℓW)=C ∞(ℝ k)⊗W.
  C^\infty( \mathbb{R}^k \times \ell W)
  = 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) \otimes W
  \,.


This appears for instance in Kock Reyes (1).

Definition
Define a structure of a site on FormalCartSp by declaring a covering family to be a family of the form
{U i×ℓW→p i×IdU×ℓW}
  \{
    U_i \times \ell W \stackrel{p_i \times Id}{\to} U \times \ell W
  \}


where {U i→p iU}\{U_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} U\} is an open cover of the Cartesian space UU by Cartesian spaces U iU_i.

This appears as Kock (5.1).

Definition
The Cahiers topos 𝒞𝒯\mathcal{CT} is the category of sheaves on this site:
𝒞𝒯:=Sh(FormalCartSp).
  \mathcal{CT} := Sh(FormalCartSp)  
  \,.


This site of definition appears in Kock, Reyes. The original definition is due to Dubuc 79
Synthetic differential geometry

Proposition
The Cahiers topos is a well-adapted model for synthetic differential geometry.

This is due to Dubuc 79.
Connectedness, locality and cohesion

Proposition
The Cahiers topos is a cohesive topos. See synthetic differential infinity-groupoid for details.

Convenient vector spaces

Proposition
The category of convenient vector spaces with smooth functions between them embeds as a full subcategory into the Cahiers topos.
The embedding is given by sending a convenient vector space VV to the sheaf given by
V:ℝ k×ℓW↦C ∞(ℝ k,V)⊗W.
  V
  : 
  \mathbb{R}^k \times \ell W
  \mapsto 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k, V) \otimes W
  \,.


This result was announced in Kock. See the corrected proof in (KockReyes).

Remark
Together with prop.  this means that the differential geometry on convenient vector spaces may be treated synthetically in the Cahiers topos.

Synthetic tangent bundles of smooth spaces
Synthetic tangent spaces
We discuss here induced synthetic tangent spaces of smooth spaces in the sense of diffeological spaces and more general sheaves on the site of smooth manifolds after their canonical embedding into the Cahiers topos.

Definition
Write SmoothLocSmoothLoc for the category of smooth loci. Write
CartSp↪SmoothLoc
  CartSp \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


for the full subcategory on the Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n (n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}). Write
InfThPoint↪SmoothLoc
  InfThPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


for the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points, and write
CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothLoc
  CartSp_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


for the full subcategory on those smooth loci which are the cartesian product of a Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n (n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}) and an infinitesimally thickened point.
We regard CartSp as a site by equipping it with the good open cover coverage. We regard InfThPointInfThPoint as equipped with the trivial coverage and CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} as equipped with the induced product coverage.
The sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is that of smooth spaces. The sheaf topos Sh(CartSp synthdiff)Sh(CartSp_{synthdiff}) is the Cahier topos.


Example
We write
D≔ℓ(ℝ[ϵ]/(ϵ 2))∈InfThPt↪CartSp synthdiff
  D \coloneqq \ell(\mathbb{R}[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2))
  \in 
  InfThPt \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the infinitesimal interval, the smooth locus dual to the smooth algebra “of dual numbers”.


Definition
For X∈Sh(CartSp synthdiff)X \in Sh(CartSp_{synthdiff}) any object in the Cahier topos, its synthetic tangent bundle in the sense of synthetic differential geometry is the internal hom space X DX^D, equipped with the projection map
X(*→D):X D→X.
  X(\ast \to D) \colon X^D \to X
  \,.



Proposition
The canonical inclusion functor i:CartSp→CartSp synthdiffi \colon CartSp \to CartSp_{synthdiff} induces an adjoint pair
Sh(CartSp)←i *→i !Sh(CartSp synthdiff)
  Sh(CartSp)
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\underset{i^\ast}{\leftarrow}}
  Sh(CartSp_{synthdiff})


where i *i^\ast is given by precomposing a presheaf on CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} with ii. The left adjoint i !i_! has the interpretation of the inclusion of smooth spaces as reduced objects in the Cahiers topos.

This is discussed in more detail at synthetic differential infinity-groupoid.

Proposition
For X∈Sh(CartSp)X \in Sh(CartSp) a smooth space, and for ℓ(W)∈InfThPoint\ell(W) \in InfThPoint an infinitesimally thickened point, the morphisms
ℓ(W)→i !X
  \ell(W) \to i_! X


in Sh(CartSp synthdiff)Sh(CartSp_{synthdiff}) are in natural bijection to equivalence classes of pairs of morphisms
ℓ(W)→ℝ n→X
  \ell(W) \to \mathbb{R}^n \to X


consisting of a morphism in CartSp synthCartSp_{synth} on the left and a morphism in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) on the right (which live in different categories and hence are not composable, but usefully written in juxtaposition anyway). The equivalence relation relates two such pairs if there is a smooth function ϕ:ℝ n→ℝ n′\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n'} such that in the diagram
  ℝ n  ↗  ↘ ℓ(W)  ↓ ϕ  X  ↘  ↗   ℝ n′
  \array{
    && \mathbb{R}^n
    \\
    & \nearrow & & \searrow
    \\
    \ell(W) && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\phi}} && X
    \\
    & \searrow && \nearrow
    \\
    && \mathbb{R}^{n'}
  }


the left triangle commutes in CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} and the right one in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp).


Proof
By general properties of left adjoints of functors of presheaves, i !Xi_! X is the left Kan extension of the presheaf XX along ii. By the Yoneda lemma and the coend formula for these (as discussed there), we have that the set of maps ℓ(W)→i !X\ell(W) \to i_! X is naturally identified with
(i !X)(ℓ(W))=(Lan iX)(ℓ(W))=∫ ℝ n∈CartSpHom CartSp synthdiff(ℓ(W),ℝ n)×X(ℝ n).
  (i_! X)(\ell(W))
  =
  (Lan_i X)(\ell(W))
  =
  \int^{\mathbb{R}^n \in CartSp}
  Hom_{CartSp_{synthdiff}}(\ell(W), \mathbb{R}^n)
  \times 
  X(\mathbb{R}^n)
  \,.


Unwinding the definition of this coend as a coequalizer yields the above description of equivalence classes.

A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}
  \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
A formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with a cohesive structure that subsumes that of smooth ∞-groupoids as well as of infinitesimal ∞\infty-groupoids – ∞-Lie algebroids, hence equipped with “differential cohesion”.
In the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids the canonical fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos Π(X)\mathbf{\Pi}(X) factors through a version relative to Smooth∞Grpd: the infinitesimal path ∞-functor Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X). In traditional terms this is the object modeled by the tangent Lie algebroid and the de Rham space of XX. The quasicoherent ∞-stacks on Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) are D-modules on XX.
We consider (∞,1)-sheaves over a “twisted semidirect product” site or (∞,1)-site of


Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them as for smooth ∞-groupoids,


and a category or (∞,1)-category of infinitesimally thickened points.


First in

1-localic definition

we consider the 1-site, then in

∞-localic definition

we consider the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site.
1-localic definition

Definition
Let T:=T :=  CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the syntactic category of the Lawvere theory of smooth algebras: the category of Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and smooth functions between them.
Write
SmoothAlg:=TAlg
  SmoothAlg := T Alg


for its category of T-algebras – the smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings).
Let
InfPoint↪SmoothAlg op
  InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}


be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points: this smooth algebras whose underlying abelian group is a vector space of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R} \oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional real vector space and nilpotent in the algebra structure.


Definition
Let
FormalCartSp↪SmoothLoc
  FormalCartSp \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


be the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on the objects of the form
U=ℝ n×D
  U = \mathbb{R}^n \times D


that are products of a Cartesian space ℝ n∈\mathbb{R}^n \in CartSp for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and an infinitesimally thickened point D∈InfPointD \in InfPoint. (See at FormalCartSp.)
Equip this category with the coverage where a family of morphisms is covering precisely if it is of the form {U i×D→(f i,Id D)U×D}\{U_i \times D \stackrel{(f_i, Id_D)}{\to} U \times D\} for {f i:U i→U}\{f_i : U_i \to U\} a covering in CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} (a good open cover).

This appears as ([Kock 86, (5.1)]).

Note
The sheaf topos over FormalCartSp is (equivalent to) the topos known as the Cahiers topos, a smooth topos that constitutes a well adapted model for synthetic differential geometry. See at Cahiers topos for further references.


Definition
We say the (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves
FormalSmooth∞Grpd:=Sh (∞,1)(FormalCartSp)
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FormalCartSp)


on FormalCartSpFormalCartSp.

∞\infty-localic
We now generalize the 1-category InfPointInfPoint of infinitesimally thickened points to the (∞,1)-category InfPoint ∞InfPoint_\infty of “derived infinitesimally thickened points”, the formal dual of “small commutative ∞\infty-algebras” from (Hinich, Lurie).
(…)

Proposition
FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
Because FormalCartSp is an ∞-cohesive site. See there for details.


Definition
Write FormalSmoothMfd↪SmoothAlg opFormalSmoothMfd \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} for the full subcategory of smooth loci on the formal smooth manifolds: those modeled on FormalCartSp equipped with the evident coverage.


Observation
FormalCartSpFormalCartSp is a dense sub-site of FormalSmoothMfdFormalSmoothMfd.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(FSmoothMfd)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FSmoothMfd)


with the hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos over FSmoothMfdFSmoothMfd.


Proof
With the above observation this is directly analogous to the corresponding proof at ETop∞Grpd.


Definition
Write i:CartSp smooth↪FormalCartSpi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow FormalCartSp for the canonical embedding.


Proposition
The functor i *i^* given by restriction along ii exhibits FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth\infty Grpd as an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids in that we have a quadruple of adjoint (∞,1)-functors
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd←i !→i *←i *↪i !FormalSmooth∞Grpd,
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd
  \,,


such that i !i_! is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor.


Proof
Since i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp formalsmoothi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{formalsmooth} is an infinitesimally ∞-cohesive site this follows with a proposition discussed at cohesive (infinity,1)-topos – infinitesimal cohesion.

The concept of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid or super smooth geometric homotopy type is the combination of super ∞-groupoid and smooth ∞-groupoid. The cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth super-∞\infty-groupoids is a context that realizes higher supergeometry.
Super smooth ∞\infty-groupoids include supermanifolds, super Lie groups and their deloopings etc. Under Lie differentiation these map to super L-∞ algebras.
We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at smooth super infinity-groupoid.

Definition
Write


CartSp for the site of Cartesian spaces;


InfPoint≔WAlg opInfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op} for the category of first-order infinitesimally thickened points (i.e. the formal duals of commutative algebras over the real numbers of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R}\oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional square-0 nilpotent ideal).


SuperPoint≔WAlg super opSuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op} for the category of superpoints, by which we here mean the formal duals to commutative superalgebras which are super-Weil algebras.


There are then “semidirect product” sites CartSp⋊InfinPointCartSp \rtimes InfinPoint and CartSp⋊SuperPointCartSp \rtimes SuperPoint (whose objects are Cartesian products of the given form inside synthetic differential supergeometry and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).
Set then
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊InfPoint)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)


for the collection of formal smooth ∞-groupoids (see there) and finally
SuperSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊SuperPoint)
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)


for that of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid

Here


the first inclusion picks the terminal object ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0;


the second inclusion is that of reduced objects; the coreflection is reduction, sending an algebra to its reduced algebra;


the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at superalgebra – Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras.




Remark
Passing to (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves, this yields, via (∞,1)-Kan extension, a sequence of adjoint quadruples as follows:
      ⟵      ↪  ↪    ⟵  ⟵  ⟵  Δ: ∞Grpd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↪ FormalSmooth∞Grpd ↪ SuperFormalSmooth∞Grpd   ⟵  ⟵    ↪

    &\hookrightarrow&
    SuperFormalSmooth \infty Grpd
    \\
    & &\longleftarrow& &\longleftarrow&
    \\
    & &\hookrightarrow&
  }



Proposition
Passing to the adjoint triples of idempotent monads and idempotent comonads which this induces, then yields


on the left the shape modality ∫\int, flat modality ♭\flat and sharp modality ♯\sharp,


in the middle yields the reduction modality ℜ\Re, the infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im and the infinitesimal flat modality &\&.


on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit ⇝\rightsquigarrow is the bosonic modality and whose left piece ⇉\rightrightarrows produces super-even components, containing all the “fermion currents” if one wishes , which in this unity of opposites hence deserves to be called the fermionic modality. The further right adjoint RhRh is the rheonomy modality.


Hence we get a process of adjoint modalities of the form
  id ⊣ id   ∨  ∨  fermionic ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosonic   ⊥  ⊥  bosonic ⇝ ⊣ Rh rheonomic   ∨  ∨  reduced ℜ ⊣ ℑ infinitesimal   ⊥  ⊥  infinitesimal ℑ ⊣ & étale   ∨  ∨  contractible ʃ ⊣ ♭ discrete   ⊥  ⊥  discrete ♭ ⊣ ♯ differential   ∨  ∨   ∅ ⊣ *
  \array{
    && id &\dashv& id 
    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    &\stackrel{fermionic}{}& \rightrightarrows &\dashv& \rightsquigarrow & \stackrel{bosonic}{}
    \\
    && \bot && \bot
    \\
    &\stackrel{bosonic}{} & \rightsquigarrow &\dashv& Rh & \stackrel{rheonomic}{}
    \\

    &\stackrel{contractible}{}& &#643; &\dashv& \flat & \stackrel{discrete}{}

    \\
    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }


where “∨\vee” denotes inclusion of modal types. The first level is cohesion, the second is differential cohesion (elasticity), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further “square roots” of all infinitesimal generators.


Proof
All the sites are ∞-cohesive sites, which gives that we have an cohesive (infinity,1)-topos. The composite inclusion on the right is an ∞-cohesive neighbourhood site, whence the inclusion Smooth∞Gpd↪SuperFormalSmooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd exhibits differential cohesion.
With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the Aufhebung of ℜ⊣ℑ\Re \dashv \Im by ⇝⊣Rh\rightsquigarrow \dashv Rh and the further opposition ⇉⊣⇝\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow.

Higher Lie theory is the refinement of Lie theory to higher geometry (higher differential geometry). It studies smooth ∞-groupoids and L-∞ algebroids and their relation via Lie integration and Lie differentiation.
A Lie algebra is the infinitesimal approximation to a Lie group.
Ordinary definition
A Lie algebra is a vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} equipped with a bilinear skew-symmetric map [−,−]:𝔤∧𝔤→𝔤[-,-]  : \mathfrak{g} \wedge \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g} which satisfies the Jacobi identity:
∀x,y,z∈𝔤:[x,[y,z]]+[z,[x,y]]+[y,[z,x]]=0.
  \forall x,y,z \in \mathfrak{g} : \left[x,\left[y,z\right]\right] + \left[z,\left[x,y\right]\right] + \left[y,\left[z,x\right]\right] = 0
  \,.


A homomorphism of Lie algebras is a linear map ϕ:𝔤→𝔥\phi : \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h} such that for all x,y∈𝔤x,y \in \mathfrak{g} we have
ϕ([x,y] 𝔤)=[ϕ(x),ϕ(y)] 𝔥.
  \phi([x,y]_{\mathfrak{g}}) = [\phi(x),\phi(y)]_{\mathfrak{h}}
  \,.


This defines the category LieAlg of Lie algebras.
Internal to a general linear category
The notion of Lie algebra may be formulated internal to any linear category. This general definition subsumes variants of Lie algebras such as super Lie algebras.
Consider a commutative unital ring kk, and a (strict for simplicity) symmetric monoidal kk-linear category (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C},\otimes,1) with braiding τ\tau.
A Lie algebra object in (𝒞,⊗,1,τ)(\mathcal{C},\otimes,1,\tau) is


an object
L∈𝒞
  L \in \mathcal{C}



morphism (the Lie bracket)
[−,−]:L⊗L→L
  [-,-] \;\colon\; L \otimes L \to L



such that the following conditions hold:


Jacobi identity:
[−,[−,−]]+[−,[−,−]]∘(id L⊗τ L,L)∘(τ⊗id L)+[−,[−,−]]∘(τ L,L⊗id L)∘(id L⊗τ L,L)=0
  \left[-,\left[-,-\right]\right]
    +
  \left[-,\left[-,-\right]\right]
  \circ(id_L\otimes\tau_{L,L})
  \circ(\tau\otimes id_L)
  +
  \left[-,\left[-,-\right]\right]
    \circ 
  (\tau_{L,L}\otimes id_L)\circ (id_L\otimes\tau_{L,L}) = 0



skew-symmetry:
 +[−,−]  +[−,−]∘τ L,L  =+0
  \begin{aligned}
    & 
    \phantom{+}
    [-,-]
    \\
    &
    +
    [-,-]\circ \tau_{L,L} 
    \\
    & = \phantom{+} 0
  \end{aligned}



Equivalently, Lie algebra objects are the algebras over an operad over a certain quadratic operad, called the Lie operad, which is the Koszul dual of the commutative algebra operad.
Examples of types of Lie algebra objects:
If kk is the ring ℤ\mathbb{Z} of integers and 𝒞=\mathcal{C} =  kkMod = Ab is the category of abelian groups equipped with the tensor product of abelian groups, then a Lie algebra object is called a Lie ring.
If kk is a field and 𝒞=\mathcal{C} = Vect is the category of vector spaces over kk equipped with the tensor product of vector spaces then a Lie algebra object is an ordinary_Lie k-algebra.
If kk is a field and 𝒞\mathcal{C} = sVect is the category of super vector spaces over kk, then a Lie algebra object is a super Lie algebra.
General abstract perspective
Lie algebras are equivalently groups in “infinitesimal geometry”.
For instance in synthetic differential geometry then a Lie algebra of a Lie group is just the first-order infinitesimal neighbourhood of the unit element (e.g. Kock 09, section 6).
More generally in geometric homotopy theory, Lie algebras, being 0-truncated L-∞ algebras are equivalently “infinitesimal ∞-group geometric ∞-stacks” (e.g. here-topos#FormalModuliProblems)), also called formal moduli problems (see there for more).

Lie's three theorems




L ∞L_\infty-algebras (or strong homotopy Lie algebras) are a higher generalization (a “vertical categorification”) of Lie algebras: in an L ∞L_\infty-algebra the Jacobi identity is allowed to hold (only) up to higher coherent homotopy.
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra that is concentrated in lowest degree is an ordinary Lie algebra. If it is concentrated in the lowest two degrees is is a Lie 2-algebra, etc.
From another perspective: an L ∞L_\infty-algebra is a Lie ∞-algebroid with a single object.
L ∞L_\infty-algebras are infinitesimal approximations of smooth ∞-groups in analogy to how an ordinary Lie algebra is an infinitesimal approximation of a Lie group. Under Lie integration every L ∞L_\infty-algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} “exponentiates” to a smooth ∞-group Ωexp(𝔤)\Omega \exp(\mathfrak{g}).
In terms of algebras over an operad
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is an algebra over an operad in the category of chain complexes over the L-∞ operad.
In the following we spell out in detail what this means in components.
In terms of higher brackets
We now state the definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras that is most directly related to the traditional definition of ordinary Lie algebras, namely as ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} equipped with nn-ary multilinear and graded-skew symmetric maps [−,⋯,−][-,\cdots,-] – the “brackets” – that satisfy a generalization of the Jacobi identity.
To that end, we here choose grading conventions such that the following definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras reduces to that of ordinary Lie algebras when 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is concentrated in degree zero. Moreover we take the differential of the underlying chain complex of the L ∞L_\infty-algebra to have degree −1-1 (“homological grading”). Together this means in particular that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is a Lie n-algebra for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, n≥1n \geq 1, if it is concentrated in degrees 0 to n−1n-1.
Beware that there are also other conventions possible, and there are other conventions in use, for both these choices, leading to different signs in the following formulas.

Definition
(graded signature of a permuation)
Let VV be a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space, and for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} let
v=(v 1,v 2,⋯,v n)
  \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n)


be an n-tuple of elements of VV of homogeneous degree |v i|∈ℤ\vert v_i \vert  \in \mathbb{Z}, i.e. such that v i∈V |v i|v_i \in V_{\vert v_i\vert}.
For σ\sigma a permutation of nn elements, write (−1) |σ|(-1)^{\vert \sigma \vert} for the signature of the permutation, which is by definition equal to (−1) k(-1)^k if σ\sigma is the composite of k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} permutations that each exchange precisely one pair of neighboring elements.
We say that the v\mathbf{v}-graded signature of σ\sigma
χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)∈{−1,+1}
  \chi(\sigma, v_1, \cdots, v_n) \;\in\; \{-1,+1\}


is the product of the signature of the permutation (−1) |σ|(-1)^{\vert \sigma \vert} with a factor of (−1) |v i||v j|(-1)^{\vert v_i \vert \vert v_j \vert} for each interchange of neighbours (⋯v i,v j,⋯)(\cdots v_i,v_j, \cdots ) to (⋯v j,v i,⋯)(\cdots v_j,v_i, \cdots ) involved in the decomposition of the permuation as a sequence of swapping neighbour pairs.


Definition
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is


a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g};


for each n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, n≥1n \geq 1 a multilinear map, called the nn-ary bracket, of the form
l n(⋯)≔[−,−,⋯,−] n:𝔤⊗⋯⊗𝔤⏟ncopies⟶𝔤
  l_n(\cdots) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  [-,-, \cdots, -]_n 
  \;\colon\; 
    \underset{n \; \text{copies}}{\underbrace{\mathfrak{g} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathfrak{g}}}
    \longrightarrow
    \mathfrak{g}


and of degree n−2n-2
(if one includes here n=0n = 0 then one speaks of a curved L-infinity algebra)


such that the following conditions hold:


(graded skew symmetry) each l nl_n is graded antisymmetric, in that for every permutation σ\sigma of nn elements and for every n-tuple (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1, \cdots, v_n) of homogeneously graded elements v i∈𝔤 |v i|v_i \in \mathfrak{g}_{\vert v_i \vert} then
l n(v σ(1),v σ(2),⋯,v σ(n))=χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)⋅l n(v 1,v 2,⋯v n)
  l_n(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma(n)}) 
  = 
  \chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) \cdot l_n(v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n)


where χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)\chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) is the (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1,\cdots,v_n)-graded signature of the permuation σ\sigma, according to def. ;


(strong homotopy Jacobi identity) for all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, and for all 


n

n

-tuples (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1, \cdots, v_n) of homogeneously graded elements v i∈𝔤 |v i|v_i \in \mathfrak{g}_{\vert v_i \vert} the following equation holds
(1)∑ i,j∈ℕi+j=n+1∑ σ∈UnShuff(i,j−1)χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)(−1) i(j−1)l j(l i(v σ(1),⋯,v σ(i)),v σ(i+1),⋯,v σ(n))=0,
  
  \sum_{{i,j \in \mathbb{N}} \atop {i+j = n+1}} 
  \sum_{\sigma \in UnShuff(i,j-1)}
  \chi(\sigma,v_1, \cdots, v_{n})
  (-1)^{i(j-1)}
   l_{j} \left(
     l_i \left( v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(i)} \right),
     v_{\sigma(i+1)} , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)}
   \right)
  = 0
  \,,


where the inner sum runs over all (i,j−1)(i,j-1)-unshuffles σ\sigma and where χ\chi is the graded signature sign from def. .




Example
In lowest degrees the generalized Jacobi identity says that


for n=1n = 1: the unary map ∂≔l 1\partial \coloneqq l_1 squares to 0:
∂(∂(v 1))=0
  \partial (\partial(v_1)) = 0



for n=2n = 2: the unary map ∂\partial is a graded derivation of the binary map
−[∂v 1,v 2]−(−1) |v 1||v 2|[∂v 2,v 1]+∂[v 1,v 2]=0
  - [\partial v_1, v_2] 
  - (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert \vert v_2 \vert}
  [\partial v_2, v_1]
  +
  \partial [v_1, v_2]
  =
  0


hence
∂[v 1,v 2]=[∂v 1,v 2]+(−1) |v 1|[v 1,∂v 2].
  \partial [v_1, v_2] =  [\partial v_1, v_2] + (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert} [v_1, \partial v_2]
  \,.





Example
When all higher brackets vanish, l k>2=0l_{k \gt 2}= 0 then for n=3n = 3:
[[v 1,v 2],v 3]+(−1) |v 1|(|v 2|+|v 3|)[[v 2,v 3],v 1]+(−1) |v 2|(|v 1|+|v 3|)[[v 1,v 3],v 2]=0
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  0


this is the graded Jacobi identity. So in this case the L ∞L_\infty-algebra is equivalently a dg-Lie algebra.


Example
When l 3l_3 is possibly non-vanishing, then on elements x ix_i on which ∂=l 1\partial = l_1 vanishes then the generalized Jacobi identity for n=3n = 3 gives
[[v 1,v 2],v 3]+(−1) |v 1|(|v 2|+|v 3|)[[v 2,v 3],v 1]+(−1) |v 2|(|v 1|+|v 3|)[[v 1,v 3],v 2]=−∂[v 1,v 2,v 3].
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  - \partial [v_1, v_2, v_3]
  \,.


This shows that the Jacobi identity holds up to an “exact” term, hence up to homotopy.

In terms of semifree differential coalgebra
In (Lada-Stasheff 92) it was pointed out that the higher brackets of an L ∞L_\infty-algebra (def. ) induce on the graded-co-commutative cofree coalgebra ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} over the underlying graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} the structure of a differential graded coalgebra, with differential D=[−]+[−,−]+[−,−,−]+⋯D = [-] + [-,-] + [-,-,-] + \cdots the sum of the higher brackets, extended as graded coderivations. The higher Jacobi identity is equivalently the condition that D 2=0D^2 = 0. In (Lada-Markl 94) it was observed that conversely, such “semifree” differential graded coalgebras are an equivalent incarnation of L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
(If one uses unital dg-co-algebras then the L ∞L_\infty-algbras encoded with way are generally curved L-infinity algebras. To restrict to the non-curved one one either considers co-augmented unital dg-co-algebras or non-unital coalgebras.)
Notice that this immediately imples that if 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is degreewise finite dimensional, then passing to dual vector spaces turns semifree differential graded coalgebra into semifree differential graded algebras, which hence are opposite-equivalent to L ∞L_\infty-algebras of finite type. For 𝔤\mathfrak{g} an ordinary finite dimensional Lie algebra, then this dg-algebras is its Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra, hence we may generally speak of Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras of L ∞L_\infty-algebras of finite type (and also more generally, if one invokes pro-objects, see at model structure for L-infinity algebras – Use of pro-dg-algebras ).
In term of the operadic definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras above this equivalence is an incarnation of the Koszul duality between the Lie operad and the commutative operad.
We now spell out this dg-coalgebraic incarnation of L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
A (connected) L ∞L_\infty-algebra is


an ℕ +\mathbb{N}_+-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g};


equipped with a differential D:∨ •𝔤→∨ •𝔤D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} of degree −1-1 on the free graded co-commutative coalgebra over 𝔤\mathfrak{g} that squares to 0


D 2=0.
  D^2 = 0
  \,.


Here the free graded co-commutative co-algebra ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} is, as a vector space, the same as the graded Grassmann algebra ∧ •𝔤\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g} whose elements we write as
3t 1∨t 2+t 3+t 3∨t 4∨t 5
  3 t_1 \vee t_2 + t_3 + t_3 \vee t_4 \vee t_5


etc (where the ∨\vee is just a funny way to write the wedge ∧\wedge, in order to remind us that:…)
but thought of as equipped with the standard coproduct
Δ(v 1∨v 2⋯∨v n)∝∑ i±(v 1∨⋯∨v i)⊗(v i+1∨⋯∨v n)
  \Delta (v_1 \vee v_2 \cdots \vee v_n)
  \propto \sum_i \pm (v_1 \vee \cdots \vee v_i) \otimes (v_{i+1} \vee \cdots \vee v_n)



(work out or see the references for the signs and prefacors).

Since this is a free graded co-commutative coalgebra, one can see that any differential
D:∨ •𝔤→∨ •𝔤
  D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}


on it is fixed by its value “on cogenerators” (a statement that is maybe unfamiliar, but simply the straightforward dual of the more familar statement to which we come below, that differentials on free graded algebras are fixed by their action on generators) which means that we can decompose DD as
D=D 1+D 2+D 3+⋯,
  D = D_1 +  D_2 + D_3 + \cdots
  \,,


where each D iD_i acts as l il_i when evaluated on a homogeneous element of the form t 1∨⋯∨t nt_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n and is then uniquely extended to all of ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} by extending it as a coderivation on a coalgebra.
For instance D 2D_2 acts on homogeneous elements of word lenght 3 as
D 2(t 1∨t 2∨t 3)=D 2(t 1,t 2)∨t 3±permutations.
  D_2(t_1 \vee t_2 \vee t_3) = 
  D_2(t_1, t_2)\vee t_3 \pm permutations
  \,.



exercise for the reader: spell this all out more in detail with all the signs and everyrthing. Possibly by looking it up in the references given below.

Using this, one checks that the simple condition that DD squares to 0 is precisely equivalent to the infinite tower of generalized Jacobi identities:
(D 2=0)⇔(∀n:∑ i+j=n∑ shufflesσ±l i(l j(v σ(1),⋯,v σ(j)),v σ(j+1),⋯,v σ(n))=0).
  (D^2 = 0)
  \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
    \forall n : 
  \sum_{i+j = n} \sum_{shuffles \sigma}
  \pm l_i (l_j (v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(j)} )
   , v_{\sigma(j+1)} , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)} ) = 0
  \right)
  \,.


So in conclusion we have:

An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is a dg-coalgebra whose underlying coalgebra is cofree and concentrated in negative degree.

In terms of semifree differential algebra
The reformulation of an L ∞L_\infty-algebra as simply a semi-co-free graded-co-commutative coalgebra (∨ •𝔤,D)(\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D) is a useful repackaging of the original definition, but the coalgebraic aspect tends to be not only unfamiliar, but also a bit inconvenient. At least when the graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is degreewise finite dimensional, we may simply pass to its degreewise dual graded vector space 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*.
(Fully generally the following works when using not just dg-algebras but pro-objects in dg-algebras, see at model structure for L-infinity algebras – Use of pro-dg-algebras).
Its Grassmann algebra ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* is then naturally equipped with an ordinary differential d=D *d = D^* which acts on ω∈∧ •𝔤 *\omega \in \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* as
(dω)(t 1∨⋯∨t n)=±ω(D(t 1∨⋯∨t n)).
  (d \omega) (t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n) =
  \pm \omega(D(t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n))
  \,.


When the grading-dust has settled one finds that with
∧ •𝔤 *=k⊕𝔤 1 *⊕(𝔤 1 *∧𝔤 1 *⊕𝔤 2 *)⊕⋯
  \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* =
  k \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus (\mathfrak{g}^*_1 \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_2) \oplus \cdots


with the ground field in degree 0, the degree 1-elements of 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^* in degree 1, etc, that dd is of degree +1 and of course squares to 0
d 2=0.
  d^2 = 0
  \,.


This means that we have a semifree dga
CE(𝔤):=(∧ •𝔤 *,d).
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) := (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d)
  \,.


In the case that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} happens to be an ordinary Lie algebra, this is the ordinary Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of this Lie algebra. Hence we should generally call CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the L ∞L_\infty-algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.
One observes that this construction is bijective: every (degreewise finite dimensional) cochain semifree dga generated in positive degree comes from a (degreewise finite dimensional) L ∞L_\infty-algebra this way.
This means that we may just as well define a (degreewise finite dimensional) L ∞L_\infty-algebra as an object in the opposite category of (degreewise finite dimensional) commutative dg-algebras that are semifree dgas and generated in positive degree.
(In general this corresponds to curved L-infinity algebra. The flat L ∞L_\infty-algebras 𝔤\mathfrak{g} dually correspond to the dg-algebras which are augmented over ℝ\mathbb{R}, i.e for which the canonical projection CE(𝔤)⟶ℝCE(\mathfrak{g}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} is a homomorphism of dg-algebras.)
And this turns out to be one of the most useful perspectives on L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
In particular, if we simply drop the condition that the dg-algebra be generated in positive degree and allow it to be generated in non-negative degree over the algebra in degree 0, then we have the notion of the (Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of) an L-infinity-algebroid.
Details
We discuss in explit detail the computation that shows that an L ∞L_\infty-algebra structure on 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is equivalently a dg-algebra-structure on ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*.
Let 𝔤\mathfrak{g} be a degreewise finite-dimensional ℕ +\mathbb{N}_+graded vector space equipped with multilinear graded-symmetric maps
[−,⋯,−] k:Sym k𝔤→𝔤
  [-,\cdots,-]_k : Sym^k \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}


of degree -1, for each k∈ℕ +k \in \mathbb{N}_+.
Let {t a}\{t_a\} be a basis of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} and {t a}\{t^a\} a dual basis of the degreewise dual 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*. Equip the Grassmann algebra Sym •𝔤 *Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* with a derivation
d:Sym •𝔤 *→Sym •𝔤 *
  d : Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* \to Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*


defined on generators by
d:t a↦−∑ k=1 ∞1k![t a 1,⋯,t a k] k at a 1∧⋯∧t a k.
  d : t^a 
    \mapsto 
    -
   \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
   [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \,.


Here we take t at^a to be of the same degree as t at_a. Therefore this derivation has degree +1.
We compute the square d 2=d∘dd^2 = d \circ d:
ddt a =d(−1)∑ k=1 ∞1k![t a 1,⋯,t a k] k at a 1∧⋯∧t a k  =∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k−1)!l![[t b 1,⋯,t b l],t a 2,⋯,t a k] at b 1∧⋯∧t b l∧t a 2∧⋯∧t a k.
  \begin{aligned}
    d d t^a 
      &= 
    d (-1)\sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
    [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
    \\
    & = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Here the wedge product on the right projects the nested bracket onto its graded-symmetric components. This is produced by summing over all permutations σ∈Σ k+l−1\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1} weighted by the Koszul-signature of the permutation:
⋯=∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k+l−1)!∑ σ∈Σ k+l−1(−1) sgn(σ)1(k−1)!l![[t b 1,⋯,t b l],t a 2,⋯,t a k] at b 1∧⋯∧t b l∧t a 2∧⋯∧t a k.
  \cdots = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1}}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \,.


The sum over all permutations decomposes into a sum over the (l,k−1)(l,k-1)-unshuffles and a sum over permutations that act inside the first ll and the last (k−1)(k-1) indices. By the graded-symmetry of the bracket, the latter do not change the value of the nested bracket. Since there are (k−1)!l!(k-1)! l! many of them, we get
⋯=∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k+l−1)!∑ σ∈Unsh(l,k−1)(−1) sgn(σ)[[t a 1,⋯,t a l],t a l+1,⋯,t a k+l−1]t a 1∧⋯∧t a k+l−1.
  \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \left[\left[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}\right], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}\right]
    \,
    t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k+l-1}}
  \,.


Therefore the condition d 2=0d^2 = 0 is equivalent to the condition
∑ k+l=n−1∑ σ∈Unsh(l,k−1)(−1) sgn(σ)[[t a 1,⋯,t a l],t a l+1,⋯,t a k+l−1]=0
    \sum_{k+l = n-1}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \left[\left[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}\right], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}\right]
  = 0


for all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and all {t a i∈𝔤}\{t_{a_i} \in \mathfrak{g}\}. This is equation (1) which says that {𝔤,{[−,…,−] k}}\{\mathfrak{g}, \{[-,\dots,-]_k\}\} is an L ∞L_\infty-algebra.
In terms of algebras over an operad
L ∞L_\infty-algebras are precisely the algebras over an operad of the cofibrant resolution of the Lie operad.
Ind-Conilpotency

Remark
(Pridham 10, remark 3.15, remark 3.13)
For 𝔤\mathfrak{g} an L ∞L_\infty-algebra, then its CE chain dgc-coalgebra CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) (above) is ind-conilpotent.
This means that CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered colimit of sub-dg-coalgebras which are conilpotent, in that for each of them there is n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} such that their nn-fold coproduct vanishes. As such these are like “co-local Artin algebras”.
Moreover, since every dg-coalgebra is the union of its finite-dimensonal subalgebras (see at dg-coalgebra the section As filtered colimits of finite-dimensional pieces), this means that CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered colimit of finite dimensional conilpotent coalgebras.
This implies that the dual Chevalley-Eilenberg cochain algebra CE •(𝔤)CE^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered limit of finite-dimensional nilpotent dgc-algebras (actual local Artin algebras).

Relation to dg-Lie algebras
Every dg-Lie algebra is in an evident way an L ∞L_\infty-algebra. Dg-Lie algebras are precisely those L ∞L_\infty-algebras for which all nn-ary brackets for n>2n \gt 2 are trivial. These may be thought of as the strict L ∞L_\infty-algebras: those for which the Jacobi identity holds on the nose and all its possible higher coherences are trivial.

Theorem
Let kk be a field of characteristic 0 and write L ∞Alg kL_\infty Alg_k for the category of L∞L\infty-algebras over kk.
Then every object of L ∞Alg kL_\infty Alg_k is quasi-isomorphic to a dg-Lie algebra.
Moreover, one can find a functorial replacement: there is a functor
W:L ∞Alg k→L ∞Alg k
  W : L_\infty Alg_k \to L_\infty Alg_k


such that for each 𝔤∈L ∞Alg k\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty Alg_k


W(𝔨)W(\mathfrak{k}) is a dg-Lie algebra;


there is a quasi-isomorphism
𝔤→≃W(𝔤).
  \mathfrak{g} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.




This appears for instance as (Kriz & May 1995, Cor. 1.6).
For more see at relation between L-∞ algebras and dg-Lie algebras.
Relation to ∞\infty-Lie groupoids
In generalization to how a Lie algebra integrates to a Lie group, L ∞L_\infty-algebras integrate to ∞-Lie groups.
See
Lie integration
and
Lie integrated ∞-Lie groupoids.
L ∞L_\infty-algebras (or strong homotopy Lie algebras) are a higher generalization (a “vertical categorification”) of Lie algebras: in an L ∞L_\infty-algebra the Jacobi identity is allowed to hold (only) up to higher coherent homotopy.
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra that is concentrated in lowest degree is an ordinary Lie algebra. If it is concentrated in the lowest two degrees is is a Lie 2-algebra, etc.
From another perspective: an L ∞L_\infty-algebra is a Lie ∞-algebroid with a single object.
L ∞L_\infty-algebras are infinitesimal approximations of smooth ∞-groups in analogy to how an ordinary Lie algebra is an infinitesimal approximation of a Lie group. Under Lie integration every L ∞L_\infty-algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} “exponentiates” to a smooth ∞-group Ωexp(𝔤)\Omega \exp(\mathfrak{g}).
In terms of algebras over an operad
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is an algebra over an operad in the category of chain complexes over the L-∞ operad.
In the following we spell out in detail what this means in components.
In terms of higher brackets
We now state the definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras that is most directly related to the traditional definition of ordinary Lie algebras, namely as ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} equipped with nn-ary multilinear and graded-skew symmetric maps [−,⋯,−][-,\cdots,-] – the “brackets” – that satisfy a generalization of the Jacobi identity.
To that end, we here choose grading conventions such that the following definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras reduces to that of ordinary Lie algebras when 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is concentrated in degree zero. Moreover we take the differential of the underlying chain complex of the L ∞L_\infty-algebra to have degree −1-1 (“homological grading”). Together this means in particular that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is a Lie n-algebra for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, n≥1n \geq 1, if it is concentrated in degrees 0 to n−1n-1.
Beware that there are also other conventions possible, and there are other conventions in use, for both these choices, leading to different signs in the following formulas.

Definition
(graded signature of a permuation)
Let VV be a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space, and for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} let
v=(v 1,v 2,⋯,v n)
  \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_n)


be an n-tuple of elements of VV of homogeneous degree |v i|∈ℤ\vert v_i \vert  \in \mathbb{Z}, i.e. such that v i∈V |v i|v_i \in V_{\vert v_i\vert}.
For σ\sigma a permutation of nn elements, write (−1) |σ|(-1)^{\vert \sigma \vert} for the signature of the permutation, which is by definition equal to (−1) k(-1)^k if σ\sigma is the composite of k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} permutations that each exchange precisely one pair of neighboring elements.
We say that the v\mathbf{v}-graded signature of σ\sigma
χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)∈{−1,+1}
  \chi(\sigma, v_1, \cdots, v_n) \;\in\; \{-1,+1\}


is the product of the signature of the permutation (−1) |σ|(-1)^{\vert \sigma \vert} with a factor of (−1) |v i||v j|(-1)^{\vert v_i \vert \vert v_j \vert} for each interchange of neighbours (⋯v i,v j,⋯)(\cdots v_i,v_j, \cdots ) to (⋯v j,v i,⋯)(\cdots v_j,v_i, \cdots ) involved in the decomposition of the permuation as a sequence of swapping neighbour pairs.


Definition
An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is


a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g};


for each n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, n≥1n \geq 1 a multilinear map, called the nn-ary bracket, of the form
l n(⋯)≔[−,−,⋯,−] n:𝔤⊗⋯⊗𝔤⏟ncopies⟶𝔤
  l_n(\cdots) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  [-,-, \cdots, -]_n 
  \;\colon\; 
    \underset{n \; \text{copies}}{\underbrace{\mathfrak{g} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathfrak{g}}}
    \longrightarrow
    \mathfrak{g}


and of degree n−2n-2
(if one includes here n=0n = 0 then one speaks of a curved L-infinity algebra)


such that the following conditions hold:


(graded skew symmetry) each l nl_n is graded antisymmetric, in that for every permutation σ\sigma of nn elements and for every n-tuple (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1, \cdots, v_n) of homogeneously graded elements v i∈𝔤 |v i|v_i \in \mathfrak{g}_{\vert v_i \vert} then
l n(v σ(1),v σ(2),⋯,v σ(n))=χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)⋅l n(v 1,v 2,⋯v n)
  l_n(v_{\sigma(1)}, v_{\sigma(2)},\cdots ,v_{\sigma(n)}) 
  = 
  \chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) \cdot l_n(v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n)


where χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)\chi(\sigma,v_1,\cdots, v_n) is the (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1,\cdots,v_n)-graded signature of the permuation σ\sigma, according to def. ;


(strong homotopy Jacobi identity) for all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, and for all 


n

n

-tuples (v 1,⋯,v n)(v_1, \cdots, v_n) of homogeneously graded elements v i∈𝔤 |v i|v_i \in \mathfrak{g}_{\vert v_i \vert} the following equation holds
(1)∑ i,j∈ℕi+j=n+1∑ σ∈UnShuff(i,j−1)χ(σ,v 1,⋯,v n)(−1) i(j−1)l j(l i(v σ(1),⋯,v σ(i)),v σ(i+1),⋯,v σ(n))=0,
  
  \sum_{{i,j \in \mathbb{N}} \atop {i+j = n+1}} 
  \sum_{\sigma \in UnShuff(i,j-1)}
  \chi(\sigma,v_1, \cdots, v_{n})
  (-1)^{i(j-1)}
   l_{j} \left(
     l_i \left( v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(i)} \right),
     v_{\sigma(i+1)} , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)}
   \right)
  = 0
  \,,


where the inner sum runs over all (i,j−1)(i,j-1)-unshuffles σ\sigma and where χ\chi is the graded signature sign from def. .




Example
In lowest degrees the generalized Jacobi identity says that


for n=1n = 1: the unary map ∂≔l 1\partial \coloneqq l_1 squares to 0:
∂(∂(v 1))=0
  \partial (\partial(v_1)) = 0



for n=2n = 2: the unary map ∂\partial is a graded derivation of the binary map
−[∂v 1,v 2]−(−1) |v 1||v 2|[∂v 2,v 1]+∂[v 1,v 2]=0
  - [\partial v_1, v_2] 
  - (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert \vert v_2 \vert}
  [\partial v_2, v_1]
  +
  \partial [v_1, v_2]
  =
  0


hence
∂[v 1,v 2]=[∂v 1,v 2]+(−1) |v 1|[v 1,∂v 2].
  \partial [v_1, v_2] =  [\partial v_1, v_2] + (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert} [v_1, \partial v_2]
  \,.





Example
When all higher brackets vanish, l k>2=0l_{k \gt 2}= 0 then for n=3n = 3:
[[v 1,v 2],v 3]+(−1) |v 1|(|v 2|+|v 3|)[[v 2,v 3],v 1]+(−1) |v 2|(|v 1|+|v 3|)[[v 1,v 3],v 2]=0
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  0


this is the graded Jacobi identity. So in this case the L ∞L_\infty-algebra is equivalently a dg-Lie algebra.


Example
When l 3l_3 is possibly non-vanishing, then on elements x ix_i on which ∂=l 1\partial = l_1 vanishes then the generalized Jacobi identity for n=3n = 3 gives
[[v 1,v 2],v 3]+(−1) |v 1|(|v 2|+|v 3|)[[v 2,v 3],v 1]+(−1) |v 2|(|v 1|+|v 3|)[[v 1,v 3],v 2]=−∂[v 1,v 2,v 3].
  [[v_1,v_2],v_3] 
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_1 \vert (\vert v_2 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_2,v_3],v_1]
  +
  (-1)^{\vert v_2 \vert (\vert v_1 \vert + \vert v_3 \vert)}
  [[v_1,v_3],v_2]
  =
  - \partial [v_1, v_2, v_3]
  \,.


This shows that the Jacobi identity holds up to an “exact” term, hence up to homotopy.

In terms of semifree differential coalgebra
In (Lada-Stasheff 92) it was pointed out that the higher brackets of an L ∞L_\infty-algebra (def. ) induce on the graded-co-commutative cofree coalgebra ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} over the underlying graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} the structure of a differential graded coalgebra, with differential D=[−]+[−,−]+[−,−,−]+⋯D = [-] + [-,-] + [-,-,-] + \cdots the sum of the higher brackets, extended as graded coderivations. The higher Jacobi identity is equivalently the condition that D 2=0D^2 = 0. In (Lada-Markl 94) it was observed that conversely, such “semifree” differential graded coalgebras are an equivalent incarnation of L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
(If one uses unital dg-co-algebras then the L ∞L_\infty-algbras encoded with way are generally curved L-infinity algebras. To restrict to the non-curved one one either considers co-augmented unital dg-co-algebras or non-unital coalgebras.)
Notice that this immediately imples that if 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is degreewise finite dimensional, then passing to dual vector spaces turns semifree differential graded coalgebra into semifree differential graded algebras, which hence are opposite-equivalent to L ∞L_\infty-algebras of finite type. For 𝔤\mathfrak{g} an ordinary finite dimensional Lie algebra, then this dg-algebras is its Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra, hence we may generally speak of Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras of L ∞L_\infty-algebras of finite type (and also more generally, if one invokes pro-objects, see at model structure for L-infinity algebras – Use of pro-dg-algebras ).
In term of the operadic definition of L ∞L_\infty-algebras above this equivalence is an incarnation of the Koszul duality between the Lie operad and the commutative operad.
We now spell out this dg-coalgebraic incarnation of L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
A (connected) L ∞L_\infty-algebra is


an ℕ +\mathbb{N}_+-graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g};


equipped with a differential D:∨ •𝔤→∨ •𝔤D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} of degree −1-1 on the free graded co-commutative coalgebra over 𝔤\mathfrak{g} that squares to 0


D 2=0.
  D^2 = 0
  \,.


Here the free graded co-commutative co-algebra ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} is, as a vector space, the same as the graded Grassmann algebra ∧ •𝔤\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g} whose elements we write as
3t 1∨t 2+t 3+t 3∨t 4∨t 5
  3 t_1 \vee t_2 + t_3 + t_3 \vee t_4 \vee t_5


etc (where the ∨\vee is just a funny way to write the wedge ∧\wedge, in order to remind us that:…)
but thought of as equipped with the standard coproduct
Δ(v 1∨v 2⋯∨v n)∝∑ i±(v 1∨⋯∨v i)⊗(v i+1∨⋯∨v n)
  \Delta (v_1 \vee v_2 \cdots \vee v_n)
  \propto \sum_i \pm (v_1 \vee \cdots \vee v_i) \otimes (v_{i+1} \vee \cdots \vee v_n)



(work out or see the references for the signs and prefacors).

Since this is a free graded co-commutative coalgebra, one can see that any differential
D:∨ •𝔤→∨ •𝔤
  D : \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} \to \vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}


on it is fixed by its value “on cogenerators” (a statement that is maybe unfamiliar, but simply the straightforward dual of the more familar statement to which we come below, that differentials on free graded algebras are fixed by their action on generators) which means that we can decompose DD as
D=D 1+D 2+D 3+⋯,
  D = D_1 +  D_2 + D_3 + \cdots
  \,,


where each D iD_i acts as l il_i when evaluated on a homogeneous element of the form t 1∨⋯∨t nt_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n and is then uniquely extended to all of ∨ •𝔤\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g} by extending it as a coderivation on a coalgebra.
For instance D 2D_2 acts on homogeneous elements of word lenght 3 as
D 2(t 1∨t 2∨t 3)=D 2(t 1,t 2)∨t 3±permutations.
  D_2(t_1 \vee t_2 \vee t_3) = 
  D_2(t_1, t_2)\vee t_3 \pm permutations
  \,.



exercise for the reader: spell this all out more in detail with all the signs and everyrthing. Possibly by looking it up in the references given below.

Using this, one checks that the simple condition that DD squares to 0 is precisely equivalent to the infinite tower of generalized Jacobi identities:
(D 2=0)⇔(∀n:∑ i+j=n∑ shufflesσ±l i(l j(v σ(1),⋯,v σ(j)),v σ(j+1),⋯,v σ(n))=0).
  (D^2 = 0)
  \Leftrightarrow
  \left(
    \forall n : 
  \sum_{i+j = n} \sum_{shuffles \sigma}
  \pm l_i (l_j (v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(j)} )
   , v_{\sigma(j+1)} , \cdots , v_{\sigma(n)} ) = 0
  \right)
  \,.


So in conclusion we have:

An L ∞L_\infty-algebra is a dg-coalgebra whose underlying coalgebra is cofree and concentrated in negative degree.

In terms of semifree differential algebra
The reformulation of an L ∞L_\infty-algebra as simply a semi-co-free graded-co-commutative coalgebra (∨ •𝔤,D)(\vee^\bullet \mathfrak{g}, D) is a useful repackaging of the original definition, but the coalgebraic aspect tends to be not only unfamiliar, but also a bit inconvenient. At least when the graded vector space 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is degreewise finite dimensional, we may simply pass to its degreewise dual graded vector space 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*.
(Fully generally the following works when using not just dg-algebras but pro-objects in dg-algebras, see at model structure for L-infinity algebras – Use of pro-dg-algebras).
Its Grassmann algebra ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* is then naturally equipped with an ordinary differential d=D *d = D^* which acts on ω∈∧ •𝔤 *\omega \in \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* as
(dω)(t 1∨⋯∨t n)=±ω(D(t 1∨⋯∨t n)).
  (d \omega) (t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n) =
  \pm \omega(D(t_1 \vee \cdots \vee t_n))
  \,.


When the grading-dust has settled one finds that with
∧ •𝔤 *=k⊕𝔤 1 *⊕(𝔤 1 *∧𝔤 1 *⊕𝔤 2 *)⊕⋯
  \wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* =
  k \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus (\mathfrak{g}^*_1 \wedge \mathfrak{g}^*_1 \oplus \mathfrak{g}^*_2) \oplus \cdots


with the ground field in degree 0, the degree 1-elements of 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^* in degree 1, etc, that dd is of degree +1 and of course squares to 0
d 2=0.
  d^2 = 0
  \,.


This means that we have a semifree dga
CE(𝔤):=(∧ •𝔤 *,d).
  CE(\mathfrak{g}) := (\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*, d)
  \,.


In the case that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} happens to be an ordinary Lie algebra, this is the ordinary Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of this Lie algebra. Hence we should generally call CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the L ∞L_\infty-algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.
One observes that this construction is bijective: every (degreewise finite dimensional) cochain semifree dga generated in positive degree comes from a (degreewise finite dimensional) L ∞L_\infty-algebra this way.
This means that we may just as well define a (degreewise finite dimensional) L ∞L_\infty-algebra as an object in the opposite category of (degreewise finite dimensional) commutative dg-algebras that are semifree dgas and generated in positive degree.
(In general this corresponds to curved L-infinity algebra. The flat L ∞L_\infty-algebras 𝔤\mathfrak{g} dually correspond to the dg-algebras which are augmented over ℝ\mathbb{R}, i.e for which the canonical projection CE(𝔤)⟶ℝCE(\mathfrak{g}) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} is a homomorphism of dg-algebras.)
And this turns out to be one of the most useful perspectives on L ∞L_\infty-algebras.
In particular, if we simply drop the condition that the dg-algebra be generated in positive degree and allow it to be generated in non-negative degree over the algebra in degree 0, then we have the notion of the (Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of) an L-infinity-algebroid.
Details
We discuss in explit detail the computation that shows that an L ∞L_\infty-algebra structure on 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is equivalently a dg-algebra-structure on ∧ •𝔤 *\wedge^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*.
Let 𝔤\mathfrak{g} be a degreewise finite-dimensional ℕ +\mathbb{N}_+graded vector space equipped with multilinear graded-symmetric maps
[−,⋯,−] k:Sym k𝔤→𝔤
  [-,\cdots,-]_k : Sym^k \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{g}


of degree -1, for each k∈ℕ +k \in \mathbb{N}_+.
Let {t a}\{t_a\} be a basis of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} and {t a}\{t^a\} a dual basis of the degreewise dual 𝔤 *\mathfrak{g}^*. Equip the Grassmann algebra Sym •𝔤 *Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* with a derivation
d:Sym •𝔤 *→Sym •𝔤 *
  d : Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^* \to Sym^\bullet \mathfrak{g}^*


defined on generators by
d:t a↦−∑ k=1 ∞1k![t a 1,⋯,t a k] k at a 1∧⋯∧t a k.
  d : t^a 
    \mapsto 
    -
   \sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
   [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
  \,.


Here we take t at^a to be of the same degree as t at_a. Therefore this derivation has degree +1.
We compute the square d 2=d∘dd^2 = d \circ d:
ddt a =d(−1)∑ k=1 ∞1k![t a 1,⋯,t a k] k at a 1∧⋯∧t a k  =∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k−1)!l![[t b 1,⋯,t b l],t a 2,⋯,t a k] at b 1∧⋯∧t b l∧t a 2∧⋯∧t a k.
  \begin{aligned}
    d d t^a 
      &= 
    d (-1)\sum_{k = 1}^\infty 
    \frac{1}{k!}
    [t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a_k
   \,
   t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_k}
    \\
    & = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Here the wedge product on the right projects the nested bracket onto its graded-symmetric components. This is produced by summing over all permutations σ∈Σ k+l−1\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1} weighted by the Koszul-signature of the permutation:
⋯=∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k+l−1)!∑ σ∈Σ k+l−1(−1) sgn(σ)1(k−1)!l![[t b 1,⋯,t b l],t a 2,⋯,t a k] at b 1∧⋯∧t b l∧t a 2∧⋯∧t a k.
  \cdots = 
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma_{k+l-1}}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \frac{1}{(k-1)! l!}
    [[t_{b_1}, \cdots, t_{b_l}], t_{a_2}, \cdots, t_{a_k}]^a
    \,
    t^{b_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{b_l}  
    \wedge  
    t^{a_2} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k}}
  \,.


The sum over all permutations decomposes into a sum over the (l,k−1)(l,k-1)-unshuffles and a sum over permutations that act inside the first ll and the last (k−1)(k-1) indices. By the graded-symmetry of the bracket, the latter do not change the value of the nested bracket. Since there are (k−1)!l!(k-1)! l! many of them, we get
⋯=∑ k,l=1 ∞1(k+l−1)!∑ σ∈Unsh(l,k−1)(−1) sgn(σ)[[t a 1,⋯,t a l],t a l+1,⋯,t a k+l−1]t a 1∧⋯∧t a k+l−1.
  \cdots 
    =
    \sum_{k,l = 1}^\infty
    \frac{1}{(k+l-1)!}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \left[\left[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}\right], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}\right]
    \,
    t^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge t^{a_{k+l-1}}
  \,.


Therefore the condition d 2=0d^2 = 0 is equivalent to the condition
∑ k+l=n−1∑ σ∈Unsh(l,k−1)(−1) sgn(σ)[[t a 1,⋯,t a l],t a l+1,⋯,t a k+l−1]=0
    \sum_{k+l = n-1}
    \sum_{\sigma \in Unsh(l,k-1)}
    (-1)^{sgn(\sigma)}
    \left[\left[t_{a_1}, \cdots, t_{a_l}\right], t_{a_{l+1}}, \cdots, t_{a_{k+l-1}}\right]
  = 0


for all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and all {t a i∈𝔤}\{t_{a_i} \in \mathfrak{g}\}. This is equation (1) which says that {𝔤,{[−,…,−] k}}\{\mathfrak{g}, \{[-,\dots,-]_k\}\} is an L ∞L_\infty-algebra.
In terms of algebras over an operad
L ∞L_\infty-algebras are precisely the algebras over an operad of the cofibrant resolution of the Lie operad.
Ind-Conilpotency

Remark
(Pridham 10, remark 3.15, remark 3.13)
For 𝔤\mathfrak{g} an L ∞L_\infty-algebra, then its CE chain dgc-coalgebra CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) (above) is ind-conilpotent.
This means that CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered colimit of sub-dg-coalgebras which are conilpotent, in that for each of them there is n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} such that their nn-fold coproduct vanishes. As such these are like “co-local Artin algebras”.
Moreover, since every dg-coalgebra is the union of its finite-dimensonal subalgebras (see at dg-coalgebra the section As filtered colimits of finite-dimensional pieces), this means that CE •(𝔤)CE_\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered colimit of finite dimensional conilpotent coalgebras.
This implies that the dual Chevalley-Eilenberg cochain algebra CE •(𝔤)CE^\bullet(\mathfrak{g}) is a filtered limit of finite-dimensional nilpotent dgc-algebras (actual local Artin algebras).

Model category structure
See model structure for L-∞ algebras.
Relation to dg-Lie algebras
Every dg-Lie algebra is in an evident way an L ∞L_\infty-algebra. Dg-Lie algebras are precisely those L ∞L_\infty-algebras for which all nn-ary brackets for n>2n \gt 2 are trivial. These may be thought of as the strict L ∞L_\infty-algebras: those for which the Jacobi identity holds on the nose and all its possible higher coherences are trivial.

Theorem
Let kk be a field of characteristic 0 and write L ∞Alg kL_\infty Alg_k for the category of L∞L\infty-algebras over kk.
Then every object of L ∞Alg kL_\infty Alg_k is quasi-isomorphic to a dg-Lie algebra.
Moreover, one can find a functorial replacement: there is a functor
W:L ∞Alg k→L ∞Alg k
  W : L_\infty Alg_k \to L_\infty Alg_k


such that for each 𝔤∈L ∞Alg k\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty Alg_k


W(𝔨)W(\mathfrak{k}) is a dg-Lie algebra;


there is a quasi-isomorphism
𝔤→≃W(𝔤).
  \mathfrak{g} \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \,.




This appears for instance as (Kriz & May 1995, Cor. 1.6).

Relation to ∞\infty-Lie groupoids
In generalization to how a Lie algebra integrates to a Lie group, L ∞L_\infty-algebras integrate to ∞-Lie groups.
See
Lie integration
and
Lie integrated ∞-Lie groupoids.
A Lie group is a group with smooth structure. Lie groups form a category, LieGrp.

Definition
A Lie group is a smooth manifold whose underlying set of elements is equipped with the structure of a group such that the group multiplication and inverse-assigning functions are smooth functions.
In other words, a Lie group is a group object internal to the category SmthMfd of smooth manifolds.

Usually the smooth manifold is assumed to be defined over the real numbers and to be of finite dimension (f.d.), but extensions of the definition to some other ground fields or to -infinite-dimensional manifolds are also relevant, sometimes under other names (such as Fréchet Lie group when the underlying manifold is an infinite-dimensional Fréchet manifold).
A real Lie group is called a compact Lie group (or connected, simply connected Lie group, etc) if its underlying topological space is compact (or connected, simply connected, etc).
Every connected finite dimensional real Lie group is homeomorphic to a product of a compact Lie group (its maximal compact subgroup) and a Euclidean space.
Every abelian connected compact finite dimensional real Lie group is a torus (a product of circles T n=S 1×S 1×…×S 1T^n = S^1\times S^1 \times \ldots \times S^1).
There is an infinitesimal version of a Lie group, a so-called local Lie group, where the multiplication and the inverse are only partially defined, namely if the arguments of these operations are in a sufficiently small neighborhood of identity. There is a natural equivalence of local Lie groups by means of agreeing (topologically and algebraically) on a smaller neighborhood of the identity. The category of local Lie groups is equivalent to the category of connected and simply connected Lie groups.
The first order infinitesimal approximation to a Lie group is its Lie algebra.
Lie’s three theorems
Sophus Lie proved several theorems, known as Lie's three theorems, on the relationship between Lie algebras and Lie groups. Lie’s third theorem is about the equivalence of categories of finite-dimensional real Lie algebras and local Lie groups. Because Élie Cartan extended this to a global integrability theorem, Lie’s third theorem is also called the Cartan-Lie theorem.
Lie subgroups


Proposition
(Cartan's closed subgroup theorem)
If H⊂GH \subset G is a closed subgroup of a (finite dimensional) Lie group, then HH is a sub-Lie group, hence a smooth submanifold such that its group operations are smooth functions with respect to the the submanifold smooth structure.


Classification


Proposition

Every connected finite-dimensional real Lie group is homeomorphic to a product of a compact Lie group and a Euclidean space. Every abelian connected compact f.d. real Lie group is a torus (a product of circles T n=S 1×S 1×…×S 1T^n = S^1\times S^1 \times \ldots \times S^1).



The simple Lie groups have a classification into infinite series of

classical Lie groups

and a finite snumber o

exceptional Lie groups

Different Lie group structures on a group
For GG a bare group (without smooth structure) there may be more than one way to equip it with the structure of a Lie group.

Example
As bare abelian groups, the Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n are, for all nn, vector spaces over the rational numbers ℚ\mathbb{Q} whose dimension is the cardinality of the continuum, 2 ℵ 02^{\aleph_0}.
Therefore these are all isomorphic as bare group. But equipped with their canonical Lie group structure (as in the Examples) they are of course not isomorphic.

Different topologies on a Lie group

Linus Kramer, The topology of a simple Lie group is essentially unique, (arXiv)


Abstract: We study locally compact group topologies on simple Lie groups. We show that the Lie group topology on such a group SS is very rigid: every ‘abstract’ isomorphism between SS and a locally compact and σ\sigma-compact group Γ\Gamma is automatically a homeomorphism, provided that SS is absolutely simple. If SS is complex, then non-continuous field automorphisms of the complex numbers have to be considered, but that is all.

Basic examples


The real line ℝ\mathbb{R} with its standard smooth structure and the group operation being addition is a Lie group. So is every Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n with the componentwise addition of real numbers.


The quotient of ℝ\mathbb{R} by the subgroup of integers ℤ↪ℝ\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} is the circle group S 1=ℝ/ℤS^1 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}. The quotient ℝ n/ℤ n\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n is the nn-dimensional torus.


The automorphism group of any Lie group is canonically itself a Lie group: the automorphism Lie group.


Classical Lie groups
The classical Lie groups include


the general linear group GL(n)GL(n)


the orthogonal group O(n)O(n) and special orthogonal group SO(n)SO(n);


the unitary group U(n)U(n) and special unitary group SU(n)SU(n);


the symplectic group Sp(2n)Sp(2n).

The notion of Lie 2-group is the generalization of the notion of Lie group as groups are generalized to 2-groups:
it is a smooth 2-group that happens to have a model given by a Lie groupoid equipped with the structure of a group object (in general only up to homotopy).
One general way to make the notion precise is as a special case of an smooth ∞-groupoid, namely a 1-truncated ∞-group object in ∞-stacks over the site CartSp/SmthMfd, possibly with some representability condition:
these are stacks on the site of smooth manifolds (representable by Lie groupoids and) equipped with group structure: “group stacks” or “gr-stacks”.
Special cases of this have simpler definitions. For instance a crossed module internal to Diff is a model for a strict and comparatively tame Lie 2-group.
Analogous to how the infinitesimal version of a Lie group is a Lie algebra, the infinitesimal version of a Lie 2-group is a Lie 2-algebra.
A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})

Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.

A differential equation is an equation involving terms that are derivatives (or differentials). One sometimes distinguishes partial differential equations (which involve partial derivatives) from ordinary differential equations (which don't).
Variational calculus – sometimes called secondary calculus – is a version of differential calculus that deals with local extremization of nonlinear functionals: extremization of differentiable functions on non-finite dimensional spaces such as mapping spaces, spaces of sections and hence spaces of histories of fields in field theory.
Specifically, it studies the critical points , i.e. the points where the first variational derivative of a functional vanishes, for functionals on spaces of sections of jet bundles. The kinds of equations specifying these critical points are Euler-Lagrange equations.
This applies to, and is largely motivated from, the study of action functionals in physics. In classical physics the critical points of a specified action functional on the space of field configurations encode the physically observable configurations.
There are strong cohomological tools for studying variational calculus, such as the variational bicomplex and BV-BRST formalism.
The term 𝒟\mathcal{D}-geometry refers to a synthetic formulation of differential geometry with a focus on the geometry of de Rham spaces. A quasicoherent sheaf of modules over a de Rham space is called a D-module, short for module over the algebra of differential operators, which is where the term “D-geometry” derives from.
In terms of differential operators
A D-module (introduced by Mikio Sato) is a sheaf of modules over the sheaf D XD_X of regular differential operators on a ‘variety’ XX (the latter notion depends on whether we work over a scheme, manifold, analytic complex manifold etc.), which is quasicoherent as O XO_X-module. As O XO_X is a subsheaf of D XD_X consisting of the zeroth-order differential operators (multiplications by the sections of structure sheaf), every D XD_X-module is an O XO_X-module. Moreover, the (quasi)coherence of D XD_X-modules implies the (quasi)coherence of a D XD_X-module regarded as an O XO_X-module (but not vice versa).
In terms of sheaves on the deRham space
The category of 𝒟\mathcal{D}-modules on a smooth scheme XX may equivalently be identified with the category of quasicoherent sheaves on its deRham space dR(X)dR(X) (in non-smooth case one needs to work in derived setting, with de Rham stack instead).
(Lurie, above theorem 0.4, Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum 11, 2.1.1)
Remembering, from this discussion there, that


the deRham space is the decategorification of the infinitesimal path groupoid Π inf(X)\Pi_{inf}(X) of XX;


a quasicoherent sheaf on dR(X)dR(X) is a generalization of a vector bundle on XX;


a vector bundle with a flat connection is an equivariant vector bundle on the infinitesimal path ∞\infty-groupoid Π inf\Pi^{inf} of XX


this shows pretty manifestly how D-modules are “sheaves of modules with flat connection”, as described more below.
Six operations yoga
Discussion of six operations yoga for pull-push of (coherent, holonomic) D-modules is in (Bernstein, around p. 18). This is reviewed for instance in (Etingof, Ben-Zvi & Nadler 09).
The most efficient and intuitive way to define the six operations on D-modules is to transfer them from Ω-modules? (i.e., modules over the differential graded algebra of differential forms) using Koszul duality. The six operations on Ω-modules? can be defined in the standard way using the fact that differential forms can be pulled back, unlike differential operators. See the article Koszul duality for more information.
Relation to geometric representation theory
For the moment see at Harish Chandra transform.
A jet can be thought of as the infinitesimal germ of a section of some bundle or of a map between spaces. Jets are a coordinate free version of Taylor-polynomials and Taylor series.
Concrete
For
p≔E→X
  p \coloneqq E \to X


a surjective submersion of smooth manifolds and k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N}, the bundle
J kP→X
  J^k P \to X


of order-kk jets of sections of pp is the bundle whose fiber over a point x∈Xx \in X is the space of equivalence classes of germs of sections of pp, where two germs are considered equivalent if their first kk partial derivatives at xx coincide.
In the case when pp is a trivial bundle p:X×Y→Xp:X\times Y \to X its sections are canonically in bijection with maps from XX to YY and two sections have the same partial derivatives iff the partial derivatives of the corresponding maps from XX to YY agree. So in this case the jet space J kPJ^k P is called the space of jets of maps from XX to YY and commonly denoted with J k(X,Y)J^k(X,Y).
In order to pass to k→∞k \to \infty to form the infinite jet bundle J ∞PJ^\infty P one forms the projective limit over the finite-order jet bundles,
J ∞E≔lim⟵ kJ kE=lim⟵(⋯J 3E→J 2E→J 1E→E)
  J^\infty E \coloneqq \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}_k J^k E
  = 
  \underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}
  \left(
    \cdots J^3 E \to J^2 E \to J^1 E \to E
  \right)


but one has to decide in which category of infinite-dimensional manifolds to take this limit:


one may form the limit formally, i.e. in pro-manifolds. This is what is implicit for instance in Anderson, p.3-5;


one may form the limit in Fréchet manifolds, this is farily explicit in (Saunders 89, chapter 7). See at Fréchet manifold – Projective limits of finite-dimensional manifolds. Beware that this is not equivalent to the pro-manifold structure (see the remark here). It makes sense to speak of locally pro-manifolds.


The Atiyah exact sequence
When (X,𝒪 X)(X,\mathcal{O}_X) is a complex-analytic manifold with the structure sheaf of holomorphic functions, and EE a locally free sheaf of 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_X-modules, we can be even more explicit. The first jet bundle J 1(E)J^1(E) fits into a short exact sequence, called the Atiyah exact sequence:
0→E⊗ 𝒪 XΩ X 1→J 1(E)→E→0
  0\to
  E\otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X}\Omega_X^1\to
  J^1(E)\to
  E\to
  0


where J 1(E)=(E⊗Ω X 1)⊕EJ^1(E) = (E\otimes\Omega_X^1)\oplus E as a ℂ\mathbb{C}-module, but with an 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_X-action given by
f(s⊗ω,t)=(fs⊗ω+t⊗df,ft).
  f(s\otimes\omega,t)
  =
  (f s\otimes\omega+t\otimes\mathrm{d}f, f t).


The extension class [J 1(E)]∈Ext 𝒪 X 1(E,E⊗Ω X 1)[J^1(E)]\in\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{O}_X}^1(E,E\otimes\Omega_X^1) of this exact sequence is called the Atiyah class of EE, and is somewhat equivalent to the first Chern class of EE. Note that the Atiyah class is exactly the obstruction to the Atiyah exact sequence admitting a splitting, and a (holomorphic) splitting of the Atiyah exact sequence is exactly a Koszul connection.
General abstract
We discuss a general abstract definition of jet bundles.
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos equipped with differential cohesion with infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im (or rather a tower ℑ k\Im_k of such, for each infinitesimal order k∈ℕ∪{∞}k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} ).
For X∈HX \in \mathbf{H}, write ℑ(X)\Im(X) for the corresponding de Rham space object.
Notice that we have the canonical morphism, the XX-component of the unit of the ℑ\Im-monad
i:X→ℑ(X)
  i \colon X \to \Im(X)


(“inclusion of constant paths into all infinitesimal paths”).
The corresponding base change geometric morphism is
(i *⊣i *):H /X⟶Jet:=i *⟵i *H /ℑ(X)
  (i^\ast \dashv i_\ast)
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{Jet := i_*}{\longrightarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}_{/\Im(X)}



Definition
The jet comonad is the (∞,1)-comonad
i *i *:H /X⟶H /X
  i^\ast i_\ast
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}
  \longrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}_{/X}



Remark
Since base change gives even an adjoint triple (i !⊣i *⊣i *)(i_! \dashv i^\ast \dashv i_\ast), there is a left adjoint T infX× X(−)T_{inf} X \times_X (-) to the jet comonad of def. ,
T infX× X(−)⊣Jet
  T_{inf}X \times_X (-) \;\dashv\; Jet


where T infXT_{inf} X is the infinitesimal disk bundle of XX, see at differential cohesion – infinitesimal disk bundle – relation to jet bundles


Remark
In the context of differential geometry the fact that the jet bundle construction is a comonad was explicitly observed in (Marvan 86, see also Marvan 93, section 1.1, Marvan 89). It is almost implicit in (Krasil’shchik-Verbovetsky 98, p. 13, p. 17, Krasilshchik 99, p. 25).
In the context of synthetic differential geometry the fact that the jet bundle construction is right adjoint to the infinitesimal disk bundle construction is (Kock 80, prop. 2.2).
 In the context of algebraic geometry and of D-schemes as in (BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2, reviewed in Paugam, section 2.3), the base change comonad formulation inf def.  was noticed in (Lurie, prop. 0.9).

In as in (BeilinsonDrinfeld, 2.3.2, reviewed in Paugam, section 2.3) jet bundles are expressed dually in terms of algebras in D-modules. We now indicate how the translation works.

Remark
In terms of differential homotopy type theory this means that forming “jet types” of dependent types over XX is the dependent product operation along the unit of the infinitesimal shape modality
jet(E)≔∏X→ℑXE.
  jet(E) \coloneqq \underset{X \to \Im X}{\prod} E
  \,.



Definition
A quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaf on XX is a morphism of (∞,2)-sheaves
X→Mod.
  X \to Mod
  \,.


We write
QC(X):=Hom(X,Mod)
  QC(X) := Hom(X, Mod)


for the stable (∞,1)-category of quasicoherent (∞,1)-sheaves.
A D-module on XX is a morphism of (∞,2)-sheaves
ℑ(X)→Mod.
  \Im (X) \to Mod
  \,.


We write
DQC(X):=Hom(ℑ(X),Mod)
  DQC(X) := Hom(\Im (X), Mod)


for the stable (∞,1)-category of D-modules.

The Jet algebra functor is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor from commutative algebras over 𝒟(X)\mathcal{D}(X) to those over the structure sheaf 𝒪(X)\mathcal{O}(X)
(Jet⊣F):Alg 𝒟(X)→F←JetAlg 𝒪(X).
  (Jet \dashv F)
   :
   Alg_{\mathcal{D}(X)}
    \stackrel{\overset{Jet}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{F}{\to}}
   Alg_{\mathcal{O}(X)}
  \,.


For XX a (spacetime) manifold and E→XE \to X a bundle (in physics called the field bundle) with jet bundle Jet(E)→XJet(E) \to X, the variational bicomplex is essentially the de Rham complex (Ω •(Jet(E)),d)(\Omega^\bullet(Jet( E)),\mathbf{d}) of Jet(E)Jet(E) with differential forms Ω n(Jet(E))=⨁ h+v=nΩ h,v(E)\Omega^n(Jet(E)) = \bigoplus_{h+v=n} \Omega^{h,v}(E) bigraded by horizontal degree hh (with respect to XX) and vertical degree vv (along the fibers of j ∞Ej_\infty E)). Accordingly the differential decomposes as
d=d+δ,
  \mathbf{d} = d + \delta
  \,,


where d\mathbf{d} is the de Rham differential on Jet(E)Jet(E), dd is called the horizontal differential and δ\delta is called the vertical differential.
With E→XE \to X thought of as a field bundle over spacetime/worldvolume, then dd is a measure for how quantities change over spacetime, while δ\delta is the variational differential that measures how quantities change as the field configurations are varied.
Accordingly, much of classical mechanics and classical field theory on XX is formalized in terms of the variational bicomplex. For instance


a field configuration is a section of EE;


a Lagrangian is an element L∈Ω n,0(E)L \in \Omega^{n,0}(E);


a local action functional is a map
S:Γ(E)→ℝ
  S : \Gamma(E) \to \mathbb{R}


of the form
S(ϕ)=∫ XL(j ∞ϕ),
  S(\phi) = \int_X L(j^\infty \phi)
  \,,



the Euler-Lagrange equation is
E(L):=δLmodimd=0
  E(L) := \delta L \mod im d = 0



the covariant phase space is the locus
{ϕ∈Γ(E)|E(L)(j ∞ϕ)=0}
  \{
   \phi \in \Gamma(E) | E(L)(j^\infty \phi) = 0
 \}



a conserved current is an element η∈Ω n−1,0(E)\eta\in \Omega^{n-1,0}(E) that is horizontally closed on the covariant phase space
dη=0modE(L)
  d \eta = 0 \mod E(L)



a symmetry is an evolutionary vector field vv such that
v(L)=0modimd
  v(L) = 0 \mod im d



Noether's theorem asserts that every symmetry induces a conserved current.


Let XX be a smooth manifold and p:E→Xp : E \to X some smooth bundle over XX. Write Jet(E)→XJet(E) \to X for the corresponding jet bundle.
The bicomplex
The spaces of sections Γ(E)\Gamma(E) and Γ(Jet(E))\Gamma(Jet(E)) canonically inherit a generalized smooth structure that makes them diffeological spaces: we have a pullback diagram of diffeological spaces
Γ(E) ⟶ * ↓  ↓ id [X,E] ⟶p * [X,X].
  \array{
     \Gamma(E) & \longrightarrow & *
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{id}
     \\
     [X,E] &\stackrel{p_*}{\longrightarrow}& [X,X]
  }
  \,.


This induces the evaluation map
X×Γ(E)→E.
  X \times \Gamma(E) \to E
  \,.


and composed with the jet prolongation
j ∞:Γ(E)→Γ(Jet(E))
  j^\infty : \Gamma(E)  \to \Gamma(Jet(E))


it yields a smooth map (homomorphism of diffeological spaces)
(1)e ∞:X×Γ(E)→(id,j ∞)X×Γ(Jet(E))→evJet(E).
  
  e_\infty : X \times \Gamma(E) \stackrel{(id,j^\infty)}{\to}
   X \times \Gamma(Jet(E))
   \stackrel{ev}{\to}
  Jet(E)
  \,.


Write
Ω •,•(X×Γ(E))
  \Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(X \times \Gamma(E))


for the cochain complex of smooth differential forms on the product X×Γ(E)X \times \Gamma(E), bigraded with respect to the differentials on the two factors
d≔d+δ,
  \mathbf{d} \coloneqq d + \delta
  \,,


where the d\mathbf{d}, dd and δ\delta, are the de Rham differentials of X×Γ(E)X\times\Gamma(E), XX and Γ(E)\Gamma(E), respectively.

Definition
The variational bicomplex of E→XE \to X is the sub–bi-complex of Ω •,•(X×Γ(E))\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}(X \times \Gamma(E)) that is the image of the pullback of forms along the map e ∞e_\infty (1):
e ∞ *:Ω •(Jet(E))→Ω •(X×Γ(E)).
  e_\infty^* : \Omega^{\bullet}(Jet(E)) \to 
   \Omega^\bullet(X \times \Gamma(E))
  \,.


We write
Ω loc •,•≔im(e ∞ *)
  \Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}_{loc}
  \coloneqq
  im (e_\infty^*)


and speak of the bicomplex of local forms on sections on EE.

The bicomplex structure on Ω loc •,•\Omega^{\bullet, \bullet}_{loc} is attributed in (Olver 86) to (Takens 79). The above formulation as a sub-bicomplex of the evident bicomplex of forms on X×Γ(E)X \times \Gamma(E) is due to [Zuckerman 87, p. 5].

More on the horizontal differential complex

Remark
In terms of a coordinate chart (x i,u α,u i α,u ij α,⋯)(x^i, u^\alpha,u^\alpha_i,u^\alpha_{i j},\cdots) of EE covering a coordinate chart (X i)(X^i) of XX, the action of the horizontal differential on functions f∈C ∞(Jet(E))f \in C^\infty(Jet(E)) is given by the formula for the total derivative operation, but with concrete differentials substituted by the respective jet coordinates:
d hf≔∑ i(∂f∂x i+∂f∂u αu i α+∑ j∂f∂u j αu ji α+⋯)dx i.
  d_h f 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \sum_i
  \left(
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}
    + 
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial u^\alpha}u^\alpha_i
    +
    \sum_j \frac{\partial f}{\partial u^\alpha_j} u^\alpha_{j i}
    +
    \cdots
  \right)
  d x^i
  \,.


(Anderson 89, p. 10).

More abstractly, the horizontal differential is characterized as follows:

Proposition
The horizontal differential takes horizontal forms to horizontal forms, and for all sections ϕ∈Γ(E)\phi \in \Gamma(E) it respects pullback of differential forms along the jet prolongation j ∞ϕ∈Γ(Jet(E))j_\infty \phi \in \Gamma(Jet(E))
(j ∞ϕ) *∘d h=d∘(j ∞ϕ) *
  (j^\infty \phi)^\ast \circ d_h = d \circ (j^\infty \phi)^\ast


(where on the right we have the ordinary de Rham differential on the base space).

Yet more abstractly, the horizontal complex may be understood in terms of differential operators and the jet comonad as follows.

Remark
A horizontal differential nn-form α\alpha on Jet(E)→XJet(E) \to X is equivalently a homomorphism of bundles over XX
α:Jet(E)⟶∧ nT *X
  \alpha \colon Jet(E) \longrightarrow \wedge^n T^\ast X


from the jet bundle Jet(E)Jet(E) to the exterior bundle ∧ nT *X\wedge^n T^\ast X. This in turn is, by the discussion there, equivalently a differential operator α:E→∧ nT *X\alpha \colon E \to \wedge^n T^\ast X.
Now of course also the de Rham differential d Xd_X on XX is a differential operator ∧ nT *X→∧ nT *X\wedge^n T^\ast X \to \wedge^n T^\ast X. In view of this, the horizontal differential of the variational bicomplex is just the composition operation of differential operators, with horizontal forms regarded as differential operators as above.
By the fact that differential operators are the co-Kleisli morphisms of the Jet comonad, this means that the horizontal differential is
d Hα:Jet(F)⟶Jet(Jet(F))⟶Jet(α)Jet(∧ nT *X)⟶d˜ X∧ nT *X.
  d_H \alpha
  \colon
  Jet(F)
  \longrightarrow
  Jet(Jet(F))
  \stackrel{Jet(\alpha)}{\longrightarrow}
  Jet(\wedge^n T^\ast X)
  \stackrel{\tilde d_X}{\longrightarrow}
  \wedge^n T^\ast X
  \,.


(e.g. Krasil’shchik-Verbovertsky 98, around def. 3.27, Krasil’shchik-Vinogradov 99, ch 4, around def. 1.8)
Evolutionary vector fields
Vector fields on J ∞EJ^\infty E also split into a direct sum of vertical and horizontal ones, respectively being annihilated by contraction with any horizontal 11-forms or with any vertical 11-forms, 𝔛(J ∞E)=𝔛 H(J ∞E)⊕𝔛 V(J ∞E)\mathfrak{X}(J^\infty E) = \mathfrak{X}_H(J^\infty E) \oplus \mathfrak{X}_V(J^\infty E). A special kind of vertical vector field v∈𝔛 V(J ∞E)v \in \mathfrak{X}_V(J^\infty E) is called an evolutionary vector field provided it satisfies ℒ vd=dℒ v\mathcal{L}_v d = d \mathcal{L}_v and ℒ v=ι vδ+δι v\mathcal{L}_v = \iota_v \delta + \delta \iota_v, we denote the subspace of evolutionary vector fields as 𝔛 ev(J ∞E)⊂𝔛 V(J ∞E)\mathfrak{X}_{ev}(J^\infty E) \subset \mathfrak{X}_V(J^\infty E).
Horizontal, vertical, and total cohomology
Let E→XE \to X be a smooth fiber bundle over a base smooth manifold XX of dimension n.n. Write J ∞E→XJ^\infty E \to X for the jet bundle of E→XE\to X.
Write
ℱ s(J ∞E)≔I(Ω n,s(J ∞E))
  \mathcal{F}^s(J^\infty E) \coloneqq I (\Omega^{n,s}(J^\infty E))


for the projection of (n,s)(n,s)-forms to the image of the “interior Euler operator” (Anderson 89, p. 21 (50/318)).

Proposition

is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of the total space EE of the given fiber bundle.

For smooth functions of locally bounded jet order this is due to (Takens 79). A proof is also in (Anderson 89, theorem 5.9).
For smooth functions of globally bounded order and going up to the Euler-Lagrange operator EE, this is also shown in (Deligne 99, vol 1, p.188).
The fundamental variational formula

Definition
A source form is an element α\alpha in Ω loc n,1\Omega^{n,1}_{loc} such that
α ϕ(δϕ)
  \alpha_\phi(\delta \phi)


depends only on the 0-jet of δϕ\delta \phi.


Proposition
Let L∈Ω loc n,0L \in \Omega^{n,0}_{loc}.
Then there is a unique source form E(L)E(L)  such that
δL=E(L)−dΘ.
  \delta L = E(L) - d \Theta
  \,.


Moreover


E(L)E(L) is independent of changes of LL by dd-exact terms:
E(L)=E(L+dK).
  E(L) = E(L + d K)
  \,.



Θ\Theta is unique up to dd-exact terms.



This is [Zuckerman 87, theorem 3].
Here EE is the Euler-Lagrange operator .

Definition
Write
Ω=δΘ.
  \Omega = \delta \Theta
  \,.



Remark
By prop.  have
dΩ=−δE(L).
  d \Omega = -\delta E(L)
  \,.



Proposition
δE\delta E vanishes when restricted to vertical tangent vectors based in covariant phase space (but not necessarily tangential to it).
δE(L)| T E(L)=0Γ(E)=0.
  \delta E(L) |_{T_{E(L) = 0} \Gamma(E)} = 0
  \,.


This is [Zuckerman 87, lemma 8].
Presymplectic covariant phase space

Corollary
The form Ω\Omega is a conserved current.


Proof
By remark  and prop. .


Definition
For Σ⊂X\Sigma \subset X a compact closed submanifold of dimension n−1n-1, one says that
ω:=∫ ΣΩ∈Ω loc 0,2
  \omega := \int_\Sigma \Omega \in \Omega^{0,2}_{loc}


is the presymplectic structure on covariant phase space relative to Σ\Sigma.


Proposition
The 2-form ω\omega is indeed closed
δω=0
  \delta \omega = 0


and in fact exact:
θ:=∫ ΣΘ
  \theta := \int_\Sigma \Theta


is its presymplectic potential .
δθ=ω.
  \delta \theta  = \omega
  \,.


Symmetries
Let L∈Ω loc n,0L \in \Omega^{n,0}_{loc}.

Definition
An evolutionary vertical vector field v∈𝔛 ev(J ∞E)v \in \mathfrak{X}_{ev}(J^\infty E) is a symmetry if
v(L)=0modimd.
  v(L) = 0 \mod im d
  \,.



Proposition
The presymplectic form ω\omega from def.  is annihilated by the Lie derivative of the vector field on Γ(E)\Gamma(E) induced by a symmetry.

This appears as [Zuckerman 87, theorem 13].
Given a smooth bundle E→ΣE \to \Sigma over a smooth manifold Σ\Sigma, then its Euler-Lagrange complex is a resolution of the constant sheaf of locally constant functions on the jet bundle J ∞EJ^\infty E by a chain complex of sheaves of certain differential forms. The Euler-Lagrange complex starts out as the complex of horizontal differential forms up to degree n≔dim(Σ)n \coloneqq dim(\Sigma) the dimension of Σ\Sigma, the following differential is


the Euler-Lagrange operator δ El\delta_{El}


followed by the Helmholtz operator δ Helm\delta_{Helm}


0→ℝ→Ω 0,0(J ∞E)→d HΩ 1,0(J ∞E)→d H⋯→d HΩ n,0(J ∞E)→δ ELℱ 1(J ∞E)→δ Helmℱ 2(J ∞E)→δ V⋯
 0 \to \mathbb{R}
 \to
  \Omega^{0,0}(J^\infty E)
  \stackrel{d_H}{\to}
  \Omega^{1,0}(J^\infty E)
  \stackrel{d_H}{\to}
  \cdots 
  \stackrel{d_H}{\to}
  \Omega^{n,0}(J^\infty E)

  \mathcal{F}^1(J^\infty E)
  \stackrel{\delta_{Helm}}{\to}
  \mathcal{F}^2(J^\infty E)
  \stackrel{\delta_V}{\to}
  \cdots


Hence the elements in the Euler-Lagrange complex have the following interpretation


in degree dim(Σ)dim(\Sigma): local Lagrangians;


in degree dim(Σ)+1dim(\Sigma)+1: Euler-Lagrange equations of motion;


in degree dim(Σ)−1dim(\Sigma)-1: trivial local Lagrangians;


in degree dim(Σ)+2dim(\Sigma)+2: obstructions for equations of motion to be variational, i.e. to be the Euler-Lagrange equations of a local Lagrangian.

is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology of the total space EE of the given fiber bundle.

(Anderson 89, theorem 5.9).
In variational calculus the Euler-Lagrange equations of a nonlinear functional arising from transgression of a local Lagrangian density characterize the extrema of that functional, hence its critical locus (the “shell”).
This originates from and is mainly used in physics, specifically in Lagrangian field theory, where the functional in question is the action functional of a physical system, and where its critical points encode the physically realized field histories by the principle of extremal action.
The De Donder-Weyl-Hamilton equation is a refinement of Hamilton's equation from a single variational direction to many.
Where Hamilton's equation appears as a natural condition in symplectic geometry, so the De Donder-Weyl-Hamilton equation appears as the analogous condition in multisymplectic geometry/n-plectic geometry.
Where Hamilton's equation appears as the equations of motion of a mechanical system whose dynamics is described by evolution along a single parameter (time), so the De Donder-Weyl Hamilton equation appears as the equations of motion of a higher dimensional field theory given by a local Lagrangian where “evolution” is along more parameters (spacetime).
Let Σ\Sigma be a smooth manifold to be regarded as worldvolume/spacetime and let F→ΣF \to \Sigma be a smooth bundle to be thought of as the field bundle.
For simplicity of exposition we first consider local patches and take without essential restriction Σ\Sigma to be a Cartesian space and the field bundle to be a trivial vector bundle X×ΣX \times \Sigma. In all of the following the summation convention? for summation over repeated induces is understood.
We then denote the canonical coordinates on Σ\Sigma by {σ μ}\{\sigma^\mu\} and those on XX by {ϕ i}\{\phi^i\}.
Write (J 1E )*(J^1 E^)^\ast for the dualized first jet bundle of EE. Under the above assumptions this has canonical local coordinates {σ μ,ϕ i,π i μ}\{\sigma^\mu, \phi^i, \pi_i^\mu\}. Here we call π i μ\pi^\mu_i the “μ\mu-th momentum of the ii-th field”.
Consider a local Lagrangian LL which is of first order, hence which is a function on the first jet bundle J 1EJ^1 E of the field bundle.

Definition
Its Euler-Lagrange equations are
∂ μδLδ(∂ μϕ i)=δLδϕ i.
  \partial_\mu
  \frac{\delta L }{\delta (\partial_\mu \phi^i)} 
   = 
  \frac{\delta L}{ \delta \phi^i}
  \,.



Definition
The De Donder-Weyl-Hamiltonian of LL is its generalized Legendre transform (if it exists), the function
H≔π i μ∂ μϕ i−L
  H \coloneqq \pi^\mu_i \partial_\mu \phi^i - L


on the dual jet bundle.


Proposition/Definition
In terms of the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian HH, def. , the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, def. , are equivalent to the differential equations
∂ μϕ i=∂H∂π i μ,∂ μπ i μ=−∂H∂ϕ i.
  \partial_\mu \phi^i
    =
   \frac{\partial H}{\partial \pi_i^\mu} 
  \;\;\,,
  \;\;\;\;
  \partial_\mu \pi^\mu_i
   =
  -
  \frac{\partial H}{ \partial \phi^i} 
  \,.


These are called the De Donder-Weyl-Hamilton equations.

As a multisymplectic/nn-plectic Hamiltonian equation
For (X,ω)(X,\omega) a symplectic manifold and H∈C ∞(X)H \in C^\infty(X) a smooth function regarded as a Hamiltonian, then Hamilton's equations are equivalent to
ι vω=dH
  \iota_v \omega = \mathbf{d}H


for vv a tangent vector to a trajectory in phase space. This may be referred to as the “non-relativistic” form of the symplectic version of Hamilton’s equations, as the “time”-parameter is not part of the phase space.
By passing from plain phase space to the corresponding dual jet bundle, hence by adjoining a worldline coordinate tt, this is equivalent to
ι vΩ=0
  \iota_v \Omega = 0


where now
Ω=ω+dH∧dt.
  \Omega = \omega + \mathbf{d}H \wedge \mathbf{d}t
  \,.


This may accordingly be thought of as the relativistic version of Hamilton’s equations.
We now discuss the analog of both the “non-relativistic” and of this “relativistic version” of Hamilton's equation for the de Donder-Weyl-Hamilton equation.
In both cases, the nn-tuple of tangent vectors to a section which satisfies the equations of motion is characterized as a Hamiltonian n-vector field. See there for more discussion.
Relativistic form

Definition
Given a De Donder-Weyl-Hamiltonian HH, def. , define a differential form
Ω∈Ω cl n+1((J 1E) *)
  \Omega \in \Omega^{n+1}_{cl}((J^1 E)^\ast)


on the dual jet bundle (the multisymplectic form or pre-(n+1)-plectic form) by
Ω≔dϕ i∧dπ i μ∧(ι ∂ μvol Σ)+dH∧vol Σ.
  \Omega 
   \;\coloneqq \;
    \mathbf{d} \phi^i \wedge \mathbf{d} \pi^\mu_i  
   \wedge (\iota_{\partial_\mu} vol_\Sigma) 
    + 
    \mathbf{d} H \wedge vol_\Sigma
  \,.



Proposition
A section (ϕ i,π i μ):Σ→J 1E *(\phi^i, \pi^\mu_i) \colon \Sigma \to J^1 E^\ast of the dualized first jet bundle satisfies the equations of motion, prop. , precisely if its tangent vectors
v μ≔∂ μ+∂ϕ i∂σ μ∂ ϕ i+∂π i ν∂σ μ∂ p i ν
  v_\mu 
    \coloneqq \partial_{\mu} 
  + 
    \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\mu} \partial_{\phi^i}
  + 
  \frac{\partial \pi_i^\nu}{\partial \sigma^\mu} \partial_{p^\nu_i}


jointly annihilate the pre-(n+1)(n+1)-plectic form of def.  in that the equation:
(ι v 1⋯ι v n)Ω=0
  (\iota_{v_1} \cdots \iota_{v_n}) \Omega
  = 0


holds.


Proof
First, the component of this equation which does not contain any dσ μ\mathbf{d}\sigma^\mu is
ι v idϕ i∧dπ μ i=dH.
  \iota_{v_i}
  \;
  \mathbf{d}\phi^i \wedge \mathbf{d}\pi^i_\mu
  = 
  \mathbf{d}H
  \,.


This is already equivalent to the DWH equation, prop. .
Second, this already implies that the components of the equation that are proportional to dσ μ\mathbf{d}\sigma^\mu are automatically satisfied; because these components are
∂ϕ i∂σ μ∂π i μ∂σ νdσ ν−∂ϕ i∂σ ν∂π i μ∂σ μdσ ν=∂H∂ϕ i∂ϕ i∂σ νdσ ν+∂H∂π i μ∂π i μ∂σ νdσ ν
  \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\mu}
  \frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\nu}
  \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  -
  \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\nu}
  \frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\mu}
  \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  =
  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \phi^i}\frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  + 
  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \pi_i^\mu}\frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu


and inserting the DWH equations on the left makes the left side identically equal to the right hand side.


Remark
Proposition  is indeed true in the general case where HH may be spacetime dependent (depend nontrivially on the σ μ\sigma^\mu).

Non-relativistic form
To obtain the “non-relativistic” form of the (n+1)(n+1)-plectic form of the DWH equation, consider the affine dual first jet bundle with canonical coordinates {σ a,ϕ i,π i a,e}\{\sigma^a , \phi^i, \pi^a_i, e \}.

Remark
The canonical pre-(n+1)-plectic form on the affine dual first jet bundle is
ω≔dϕ i∧dϕ a μι ∂ σ μvol Σ+de∧vol Σ.
  \omega 
   \coloneqq 
  \mathbf{d}\phi^i \wedge \mathbf{d}\phi^\mu_a
  \iota_{\partial_{\sigma^\mu}} vol_\Sigma
  + 
  \mathbf{d}e \wedge vol_\Sigma 
  \,.



Remark
Vector fields tangent to a section of the affine dual first jet bundle are of the form
v μ≔∂ μ+∂ϕ i∂σ μ∂ ϕ i+∂π i ν∂σ μ∂ p i ν+∂e∂σ μ∂ e.
  v_\mu 
  \coloneqq 
    \partial_{\mu} 
  + 
    \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\mu} \partial_{\phi^i}
  + 
    \frac{\partial \pi_i^\nu}{\partial \sigma^\mu} \partial_{p^\nu_i}
  +
    \frac{\partial e}{\partial \sigma^\mu} \partial_e
  \,.



Proposition
On the affine dual first jet bundle the de Donder-Weyl-Hamilton equation characterizes those sections whose tangent vectors as above satisfy
(ι v 1⋯ι v n)ω=d(H+e)
  (\iota_{v_1} \cdots \iota_{v_n})
  \omega
  = 
  \mathbf{d}(H + e)


This has been pointed out in (Hélein 02, around equation (4)).

Proof
This is a slight variant of the proof of prop. . First, the component of the equation independend of dσ ν\mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu is
ι v idπ μ i∧dϕ i+de=dH+de.
  \iota_{v_i}
  \;
  \mathbf{d}\pi^i_\mu \wedge \mathbf{d}\phi^i 
  +
  \mathbf{d}e
  = 
  \mathbf{d}H
  +
  \mathbf{d}e
  \,.


Here the term de\mathbf{d}e cancels on both sides and leaves the equation equivalent to the DWH equation as in the first step of the proof of prop. .
Second, the component of the claimed equation proportional to dσ μ\mathbf{d}\sigma^\mu is now
∂ϕ i∂σ μ∂π i μ∂σ νdσ ν−∂ϕ i∂σ ν∂π i μ∂σ μdσ ν+∂e∂σ νdσ ν=0.
  \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\mu}
  \frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\nu}
  \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  -
  \frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\nu}
  \frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\mu}
  \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  + 
  \frac{\partial e}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  = 0
  \,.


Inserting into this the DWH equation makes it equivalent to
∂H∂ϕ i∂ϕ i∂σ νdσ ν+∂H∂π i μ∂π i μ∂σ νdσ ν+∂e∂σ νdσ ν=0
  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \phi^i}\frac{\partial \phi^i}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  + 
  \frac{\partial H}{\partial \pi_i^\mu}\frac{\partial \pi_i^\mu}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  +   
  \frac{\partial e}{\partial \sigma^\nu} \mathbf{d}\sigma^\nu
  = 0


This has a unique solution, up to a global constant, given by
e({σ ν})=−H({ϕ i({σ ν}),π i μ({σ ν})}).
  e(\{ \sigma^\nu \}) 
   = 
  - H(
    \{
      \phi^i(\{ \sigma^\nu \}), 
      \pi^\mu_i (\{ \sigma^\nu \})
    \}
    )
  \,.



Remark
By the proof of prop.  we have on shell that H+e=0H + e = 0 and that ω=Ω\omega = \Omega.

The covariant phase space of a system in physics is the space of all of its solutions to its classical equations of motion, the space of trajectories of the system. Often one considers a parameterization of this by boundary data or choice of a Cauchy surface. This parameterization is what traditionally is just called a “phase space”. The “covariant” in “covariant phase space” is to indicated that it comes without any unnatural choices.
For a system described by Lagrangian mechanics, the covariant phase space comes canonically equipped with a presymplectic structure. A proper phase space or reduced phase space is a quotient space of the covariant phase space on which the presymplectic structure refines to a symplectic structure or Poisson strucure.
Typically these phase spaces are (locally) naturally parameterized by the suitable boundary conditions which uniquely determine the corresponding history of the physical system. Much of the literature on phase spaces deals with parameterizing these boundary conditions.
For instance for a non-relativistic particle propagating on a Riemannian manifold XX with the usual action functional, a trajectory is uniquely fixed by the position x∈Xx \in X and the momentum p∈T x *Xp \in T^*_x X of the particle at a given time. Correspondingly the space of all solutions and hence the (covariant) phase space of the system may be identified with the cotangent bundle T *XT^* X of XX.
(The term “phase” in “phase space” can be related to the phase of complex numbers in this example, see at phase and phase space in physics.)
However, even reduced phase spaces are not all cotangent bundles, typically not, for instance, if they are obtained by symplectic reduction. This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general.
Chern-Weil theory studies the refinement of characteristic classes of principal bundles in ordinary cohomology to de Rham cohomology and further to ordinary differential cohomology.
The central operation that models this refinement is the construction of the Chern-Weil homomorphism from GG-principal bundles to de Rham cohomology by choosing a connection ∇\nabla and evaluating its curvature form F ∇F_\nabla in the invariant polynomials ⟨−⟩\langle -\rangle of the Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} to produce the curvature characteristic form ⟨F ∇⟩\langle F_\nabla \rangle. Its de Rham cohomology class refines a corresponding characteristic class in integral cohomology.
Concretely, the Chern-Weil homomorphism is presented by the following construction:
For


BG∈B G \in Top the classifying space of (the topological group underlying) a compact Lie group GG


and [c]∈H n(BG,ℤ)[c] \in H^n(B G, \mathbb{Z}) a class in its integral cohomology – which we may call a characteristic class for GG-principal bundles


we get for each smooth manifold XX an assignment
[c]:GBund(X) ∼→H n(X,ℤ)
  [c] : G Bund(X)_\sim \to H^n(X,\mathbb{Z})


on integral cohomology classes of base space to equivalence classes of GG-principal bundles by sending a bundle classified by a map f:X→BGf : X \to B G to the class [f *c][f^* c].
Let [c] ℝ∈H n(BG,ℝ)[c]_\mathbb{R} \in H^n(B G, \mathbb{R}) be the image of [c][c] in real cohomology, induced by the evident inclusion of coefficients ℤ↪ℝ\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}.
The first main statement of Chern-Weil theory is that there is an invariant polynomial
⟨−⟩:=ϕ −1[c] ℝ
  \langle- \rangle :=  \phi^{-1} [c]_{\mathbb{R}}


on the Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} of GG associated to [c] ℝ[c]_{\mathbb{R}}, given by an isomorphism (of real graded vector space)s
ϕ:inv(𝔤)→≃H •(BG,ℝ).
  \phi : inv(\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
   H^\bullet(B G, \mathbb{R})
  \,.


The second main statement is that this invariant polynomial serves to provide a differential (Lie integration) construction of [c] ℝ[c]_{\mathbb{R}}:
for any choice of connection ∇\nabla on a GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X we have the curvature 2-form F ∇∈Ω 2(P,𝔤)F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(P, \mathfrak{g}) and fed into the invariant polynomial this yields an nn-form
⟨F ∇∧⋯∧F ∇⟩∈Ω n(X).
 \langle F_\nabla \wedge \cdots \wedge F_\nabla \rangle
  \in
  \Omega^n(X)
  \,.


The statement is that under the de Rham theorem-isomorphism H dR •(X)≃H •(X,ℝ)H^\bullet_{dR}(X) \simeq H^\bullet(X, \mathbb{R}) this presents the class [c] ℝ[c]_{\mathbb{R}}.
The third main statement, says that this construction may be refined by combining integral cohomology and de Rham cohomology to ordinary differential cohomology: the nn-form ⟨F ∇∧⋯F ∇⟩\langle F_\nabla \wedge \cdots F_\nabla\rangle may be realized itself as the curvature nn-form of a circle n-bundle with connection c^\hat \mathbf{c}.
[c^]:GBund ∇(X) ∼→U(1)nBund ∇(X) ∼≃H diff n(X).
  [\hat \mathbf{c}] : 
  G Bund_\nabla(X)_\sim
   \to
  U(1) n Bund_\nabla(X)_\sim
   \simeq H^n_{diff}(X)
  \,.


In summary this yields the following picture:
  [c^]  ↙  ↘ [c]    [⟨F ∇∧⋯F ∇⟩]  ↘  ↙   [c] ℝ∈  H diff n(X)  ↙  ↘ H n(X,ℤ)    H dR n(X)  ↘  ↙   H n(X,ℝ).
  \array{
    && [\hat \mathbf{c}]
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    [c] && && [\langle F_\nabla \wedge \cdots F_\nabla\rangle]
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\ 
    && [c]_{\mathbb{R}}
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   \in
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    && H_{diff}^n(X)
    \\
    & \swarrow && \searrow
    \\
    H^n(X,\mathbb{Z}) && && H_{dR}^n(X)
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\ 
    && H^n(X, \mathbb{R})
  }
  \,.


A central implication of the last step is that with the refinement from curvatures in de Rham cohomology to circle n-bundles with connection in differential cohomology is that these come with a notion of higher parallel transport and higher holonomy:


the local connection form of c^\hat \mathbf{c} is the Chern-Simons form cs(∇)cs(\nabla) of a Chern-Simons element cscs of the invariant polynomial ⟨−⟩\langle- \rangle evaluated on the given GG-connection;


the corresponding higher parallel transport as an assignment
(Σ→ϕX)↦exp(∫ Σ∇ c^)∈U(1)
  (\Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} X) 
  \mapsto 
  \exp(\int_\Sigma \nabla_{\hat \mathbf{c}})
  \in U(1)


of (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional manifolds in XX to the circle group is the action functional of the corresponding Chern-Simons theory.


Specifically


for ⟨−,−⟩\langle  -,-\rangle the Killing form invariant polynomial on a semisimple Lie algebra, one calls c^\hat \mathbf{c} the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle; whose higher holonomy is the action functional of ordinary Chern-Simons theory;


for ⟨−,−,−,−⟩\langle -,-,-,-\rangle the next higher invariant polynomial on a semisimple Lie algebra, c^\hat \mathbf{c} is a Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle, and so on.


So the refined Chern-Weil homomorphism provides a large family of gauge quantum field theories of Chern-Simons type in odd dimensions whose field configurations are always connections on principal bundles and whose Lagrangians are Chern-Simons elements on a Lie algebra.
But the notion of invariant polynomials and Chern-Simons elements naturally exists much more generally for L-∞ algebras, and even more generally for L-∞ algebroids. We claim here that in this fully general case there is still a natural analog of the Chern-Weil homomorphism – which we call the ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism . Accordingly this gives rise to a wide class of action functionals for gauge quantum field theories, which may be called ∞-Chern-Simons theories.
Ordinary Chern-Weil theory is about refinements of characteristic classes of GG-principal bundles for GG a Lie group (equivalently of the classifying space ℬG\mathcal{B}G of that Lie group) from ordinary cohomology to differential cohomology.
Under ∞\infty-Chern-Weil theory we want to understand the generalization of this to (∞,1)-category theory: where Lie groups are generalized to ∞-Lie groups, Lie algebras are generalized to ∞-Lie algebras and principal bundles to principal ∞-bundles.
So ∞\infty-Chern-Weil theory produces differential cohomology-refinements of characteristic classes of GG-principal ∞-bundles for GG an ∞-Lie group, equivalently of the corresponding classifying spaces ℬG\mathcal{B}G.
Ordinary Chern-Weil theory is formulated in the context of differential geometry. We need to widen this context somewhat in order that it can accomodate the relevant higher structures and so we place ourselves in the context of the (∞,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ?LieGrpd? of ∞-Lie groupoids.
In every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos that admits a notion of differential cohomology, there is a general abstract notion of refinement of characteristic classes in cohomology to curvature characteristic classes in ordinary differential cohomology.
The main construction in ∞-Chern-Weil theory is a concrete model or presentation of this abstract operation. This model is constructed in terms of Lie integration of objects in ∞-Lie algebra cohomology. This construction is the higher analog of the Chern-Weil homomorphism. Its crucial intermediate step is the definition and construction of ∞-connections on principal ∞-bundles.
This model itself is after all built on concrete familiar constructions in differential geometry and can be studied and appreciated in itself without recourse to the higher topos theory that we claim it provides a model for. The so inclined reader can ignore all the general abstract discussion in the following and concentrate on the concrete differential geometry.
ere is how this entry here proceeds.
A warmup for the full theory that connects to classical constructions is given at

Introduction

Then in

∞-Chern-Weil theory

we discuss the general definition of ∞\infty-connections and of the Chern-Weil homomorphism and discuss some general properties. Then we turn to discussing

Examples

Principal 1-bundles with connection
We spell out here how the general theory of ∞-Lie algebra valued connection reduces to the standard notion of connections on ordinary GG-principal bundles and how the ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism reduces on these to the ordinary Chern-Weil homomorphism.
Let 𝔤\mathfrak{g} be a (finite dimensional) Lie algebra. Then
cosk 2exp(𝔤)≃BG
  \mathbf{cosk}_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \simeq \mathbf{B}G


is the delooping of the simply connected Lie group GG integrating 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.

Proposition
The coefficient object BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of genuine ∞-Lie algebra connections for 𝔤\mathfrak{g} an ordinary Lie algebra is weakly equivalent to the simplicial presheaf
BG conn→≃Ξ[G×Ω 1(−,𝔤)→p 2→Ad p 1(p 2)+p 1dp 1 −1Ω 1(−,𝔤)]
  \mathbf{B}G_{conn}
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \Xi[G\times \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{
   \overset{Ad_{p_1}(p_2)+ p_1 d p_1^{-1}}{\to}}{\underset{p_2}{\to}} \Omega^1(-,\mathfrak{g})]


that assigns objectwise the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued 1-forms.
This is moreover isomorphic to the simplicial presheaf
⋯=[CartSp op,sSet](P 1(−),BG])
  \cdots = 
  [CartSp^{op},sSet](\mathbf{P}_1(-),\mathbf{B}G])


of morphisms out of the path groupoid.
The flat coefficient object ♭BG\mathbf{\flat}\mathbf{B}G is modeled by the subobject
Ξ[G×Ω flat 1(−,𝔤)→p 2→Ad p 1(p 2)+p 1dp 1 −1Ω flat 1(−,𝔤)]
  \Xi[G\times \Omega^1_{flat}(-,\mathfrak{g}) \stackrel{
   \overset{Ad_{p_1}(p_2)+ p_1 d p_1^{-1}}{\to}}{\underset{p_2}{\to}} \Omega^1_{flat}(-,\mathfrak{g})]


of groupoids of Lie-algebra valued forms with vanishing curvature 2-form.
This is isomorphic to
⋯=[CartSp op,sSet](Π 1(−),BG])
  \cdots = 
  [CartSp^{op},sSet](\mathbf{\Pi}_1(-),\mathbf{B}G])


of morphism out of the fundamental groupoid.


Proof
The statements about morphisms out of the path groupoid are discussed in detail in SchrWalI.


Corollary
For XX a paracompact smooth manifold and {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} a good open cover we have a natural equivalence of groupoids
[CartSp op,sSet](C({U i}),BG conn)≃GBund ∇(X)
  [CartSp^{op}, sSet](C(\{U_i\}), \mathbf{B}G_{conn})
  \simeq
  G Bund_\nabla(X)


with the groupoid of smooth GG-principal bundles with connection on GG.
For ⟨−⟩:inn(𝔤)→b pℝ\langle - \rangle : inn(\mathfrak{g}) \to b^p \mathbb{R} an invariant polynomial on 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, the induced morphism
[CartSp op,sSet](C(U i}),BG diff)→⟨F (−)⟩Ω cl p+1(X)
  [CartSp^{op}, sSet](C(\U_i\}), \mathbf{B}G_{diff})
  \stackrel{\langle F_{(-)}\rangle}{\to}
  \Omega^{p+1}_{cl}(X)


is that of the ordinary Chern-Weil homomorphism.

We have seen that a refinement of the Chern-Weil homomorphism is available. The above morphism extends to a morphism
⟨F (−)⟩:H(−,BG)→H(−,τ 1♭ dRB p+1ℝ)
  \langle F_{(-)}\rangle :  \mathbf{H}(-, \mathbf{B}G)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}(-,
    \tau_{1} \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^{p+1} \mathbb{R}
  )


in H=∞LieGrpd\mathbf{H} = \infty LieGrpd represented by
[CartSp op,sSet](−,BG diff) → [CartSp op,sSet](−,cosk 2♭ dRB p+1ℝ) ↓ ≃ [CartSp op,sSet](−,BG).
 \array{
  [CartSp^{op},sSet](-, \mathbf{B}G_{diff})
  &\to&
  [CartSp^{op},sSet](-, \mathbf{cosk}_2 \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^{p+1} \mathbb{R})
  \\
  \downarrow^{\simeq}
  \\
  [CartSp^{op},sSet](-, \mathbf{B}G)
  }
  \,.


For XX a smooth manifold with good cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} we have that [CartSp op,sSet](C{U i},cosk 2♭ dRB p+1ℝ) [CartSp^{op},sSet](C\{U_i\}, \mathbf{cosk}_2 \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^{p+1} \mathbb{R}) is the groupoid whose objects are closed p+1p+1-forms on XX and whose morphisms are given by pp-forms modulo exact forms.
Let i∈Ii \in I range over a set of generators for all invariant polynomials. Then
H(−,BG)→∏ iτ 1♭ dRB n iℝ
  \mathbf{H}(-,\mathbf{B}G)
  \to 
  \prod_i \tau_1\mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbf{B}^{n_i} \mathbb{R}


is an approximation to the intrinsic Chern-character. We may consider its homotopy fibers over a given set Q iQ_i of curvature characteristic forms.
Assume ∇,∇′:C({U i})→BG diff\nabla, \nabla' : C(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbf{B}G_{diff} are two genuine connections with coinciding curvature characteristic classes {Q i}\{Q_i\}. Then in the homotopy fiber they are coboundant cocycles precisely if all the Chern-Simons forms CS i(∇,∇′)CS_i(\nabla,\nabla') vanish modulo an exact form.
This equivalence relation is that which defines Simons-Sullivan structured bundles. Their Grothendieck group completion yields differential K-theory.
Principal 2-bundles with connection
(…)
Let 𝔤\mathfrak{g} be a Lie strict 2-group coming from a differential crossed module (𝔤 2→𝔤 1)(\mathfrak{g}_2 \to \mathfrak{g}_1). Then we have two candidate Lie 2-groups integrating this: on the one hand the strict 2-group coming from the crossed module (G 2→G 1)(G_2 \to G_1) that integrates (𝔤 2→𝔤 1)(\mathfrak{g}_2 \to\mathfrak{g}_1) degreewise as ordinary Lie algebras, and on the other hand cosk kexp(𝔤)cosk_k\exp(\mathfrak{g}).

Proposition
The morphism
τ 2exp(𝔤)→B(G 2→G 1)
  \tau_2 \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \to 
  \mathbf{B}(G_2 \to G_1)


given by evaluating 2-dimensional parallel transport is a weak equivalence.


Proof
Use the 3-dimensional nonabelian Stokes theorem from the appendix of SchrWalII.


Corollary
The object B(G 2→G 1) conn\mathbf{B}(G_2 \to G_1)_{conn} assigns to U∈CartSpU \in CartSp the 2-groupoid of Lie 2-algebra valued forms over UU.

Twisted differential String−String- and FivebraneFivebrane-structures
We discuss now in detail refined Chern-Weil morphisms
c^:H conn(X,BG)→H diff(X,B nU(1))
  \hat \mathbf{c}
  :
  \mathbf{H}_{conn}(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^n U(1))


that send ∞-connections on GG-principal ∞-bundles to circle n-bundles with connection that represent a given characteristic class. c:BG→B nU(1)\mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) with coefficients in the circle n-groupoid.
Specifically, we consider the first two steps in the smooth refinement of the Whitehead tower of the orthogonal group OO that are controled by ∞-Lie algebra cohomology.
The smooth Whitehead tower of OO in ?LieGrpd? starts as
⋯→BSpin→BSO→BO,
  \cdots \to \mathbf{B}Spin \to \mathbf{B} SO \to \mathbf{B}O
  \,,


where


the delooping BSO\mathbf{B} SO of the special orthogonal group is the ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-principal bundle over BO\mathbf{B}O classified by the cocycle BO→Bℤ 2\mathbf{B}O \to \mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}_2 that sends an elemen k∈Ok \in O to +1+1 if it is in the connected component of the identity and to −1-1 if it is not. This means we have an (∞,1)-pullback diagram
BSO → * ↓  ↓ BO →w 1 Bℤ 2
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} SO &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} O &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B} \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \;



the delooping BSpin\mathbf{B} Spin of the spin group is the is the Bℤ 2\mathbf{B}\mathbb{Z}_2-principal 2-bundle over BSO\mathbf{B} SO classified by the Stiefel-Whitney class BSO→B 2ℤ\mathbf{B} SO \to \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}
BSpin → * ↓  ↓ BSO →w 2 B 2ℤ 2
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} Spin &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} SO &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \;



Since these two steps are controled by the torsion-group ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2 they have no nontrivial refinement to differential cohomology. The next step however is controled by what in the (∞,1)-topos ∞Grpd ≃\simeq Top is the first fractional Pontryagin class? 12p 1:ℬSpin→ℬ 4ℤ\frac{1}{2}p_1 : \mathcal{B} Spin \to \mathcal{B}^4 \mathbb{Z} and which lifts through the path ∞-groupoid functor Π:∞LieGrpd→∞Grpd\Pi : \infty LieGrpd \to \infty Grpd to a characteristic class in H=\mathbf{H} =  ?LieGrpd? (as discussed there) 12p 1:BSpin→B 3U(1)\frac{1}{2} p_1 : \mathbf{B} Spin \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1) with coefficients in the smooth circle 3-groupoid. This cocycle does arise as the Lie integration exp(μ)\exp(\mu) of the canonical Lie algebra 3-cocycle μ=⟨−,[−,−]⟩:𝔰𝔬→b 2ℝ\mu = \langle -,[-,-]\rangle: \mathfrak{so} \to b^2 \mathbb{R}.
The principal 3-bundle that this classifies is the delooping BString\mathbf{B} String of the string 2-group StringString
BString → * ↓  ↓ BSpin →12p 1 B 3U(1).
  \array{
    \mathbf{B} String &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B} Spin &\stackrel{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{p}_1}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)
  }
  \,.


Notice that the fact that this is an (∞,1)-pullback implies that for any X∈H=∞LieGrpdX\in \mathbf{H} = \infty LieGrpd also
H(X,BString) → * ↓  ↓ H(X,BSpin) → H(X,B 3U(1)),
  \array{
    \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B} String) &\to& * 
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B} Spin) &\to& \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}^3 U(1))
  }
  \,,


which exhibits the 2-groupoid H(X,BString)\mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}String) of string structures.
As we refine in this diagram the bottom morphism to differential cohomology, we obtain correspondingly differential string structures.
The string-lifting Chern–Simons 33-bundle with connection
We describe the special case of the general ∞\infty-Chern–Weil homomorphism for ∞\infty-Lie algebra valued connections corresponding to the characteristic class 12p 1:BSpin→B 3U(1)\frac{1}{2}p_1\colon \mathbf{B}Spin \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1): the first fractional Pontryagin class of the spin group BSpin\mathbf{B}Spin. The B 3U(1)\mathbf{B}^3 U(1)-differential cocycle that it produces from a given SpinSpin-principal bundle is the Chern?Simons 2-bundle with connection whose class is the obstruction for the existence of a string structure.

Definition
For X∈H=X \in \mathbf{H} = ?LieGrpd?, the ∞\infty-groupoid of differential fivebrane-structures Fivebrane diff(X)Fivebrane_{diff}(X) is the homotopy fiber of 16p 2(X):H(X,BString)→H diff(X,B 7U(1))\frac{1}{6}p_2(X) : \mathbf{H}(X,\mathbf{B}String) \to \mathbf{H}_{diff}(X, \mathbf{B}^7 U(1)).
More generally, the ∞\infty-groupoid of twisted differential fivebrane structures is the (∞,1)-pullback Fivebrane diff,tw(X)Fivebrane_{diff,tw}(X) in

∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory
The refined higher Chern-Weil homomorphism takes values in circle n-bundles with connection in ordinary differential cohomology. Each of these comes with a notion of higher holonomy over nn-dimensional curves Σ n→X\Sigma_n \to X. The map that takes a connection on an infinity-bundle to this holonomy is a generalization of the action functional of Chern-Simons theory.
Therefore the higher Chern-Weil homomorphism defines a class of sigma-model quantum field theories that we call
infinity-Chern-Simons theory.
See there for more details.
Special noteworthy cases are


the class of AKSZ sigma-models (FRS11)


higher Chern-Simons supergravity
(see D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity)


A connection on a bundle P→XP \to X – a principal bundle or an associated bundle like a vector bundle – is a rule that identifies fibers of the bundle along paths in the base space XX.
There are several different but equivalent formalizations of this idea:


as a parallel transport functor,


as a rule for a covariant derivative,


as a distribution (field) of horizontal subspaces – an Ehresmann connection – and via a connection 11-form which annihilates the distribution of horizontal subspaces. The connection in that sense induces a smooth version of Hurewicz connection.


The usual textbook convention is to say just connection for the distribution of horizontal subspaces, and the objects of the other three approaches one calls more specifically covariant derivative, connection 11-form and parallel transport.
In the remainder of this Idea-section we discuss a bit more how to understand connections in terms of parallel transport.
Given a smooth bundle P→XP \to X, for instance a GG-principal bundle or a vector bundle, a connection on PP is a prescription to associate with each path
γ:x→y
  \gamma : x \to y


in XX (which is a morphism in the path groupoid P 1(X)\mathbf{P}_1(X)) a morphism tra(γ)tra(\gamma) between the fibers of PP over these points
P x →tra(γ) P y x →γ y
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma)}{\to}& P_y
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& y
  }


such that


this assignment respects the structure on the fibers P xP_x (for instance is GG-equivariant in the case that PP is a GG-bundle or that is linear in the case that PP is a vector bundle);


this assignment is smooth in a suitable sense;


this assignment is functorial in that for all pairs x→γyx \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} y, y→γ′zy \stackrel{\gamma'}{\to} z of composable paths in XX we have
P x →tra(γ) P y →tra(γ′) P z x →γ y →γ′ z=P x →tra(γ′∘γ) P z x →γ′∘γ z
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma)}{\to}& P_y &\stackrel{tra(\gamma')}{\to}& P_z
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& y &\stackrel{\gamma'}{\to}& z
  }
  \;\;\;
  =
  \;\;\;
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma' \circ \gamma)}{\to}& P_z
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma'\circ \gamma}{\to}& z
  }



In other words, a connection on PP is a functor
tra:P 1(X)→At″(P)
  tra : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to At''(P)


from the path groupoid of XX to the Atiyah Lie groupoid of PP that is smooth in a suitable sense and splits the Atiyah sequence in that P 1(X)→traAt″(X)→P 1(X)\mathbf{P}_1(X) \stackrel{tra}{\to} At''(X) \to \mathbf{P}_1(X) (see the notation at Atiyah Lie groupoid).
Terminology
The functor tratra is called the parallel transport of the connection. This terminology comes from looking at the orbits of all points in PP under tratra (i.e. from looking at the category of elements of tratra): these trace out paths in PP sitting over paths in XX and one thinks of the image of a point p∈P xp \in P_x under tra(γ)tra(\gamma) as the result of propagating pp parallel to these curves in PP.
Flat connections
It may happen that the assignment tra:γ↦tra(γ)tra : \gamma \mapsto tra(\gamma) only depends on the homotopy class of the path γ\gamma relative to its endpoints x,yx, y. In other words: that tratra factors through the functor P 1(X)→Π 1(X)P_1(X) \to \Pi_1(X) from the path groupoid to the fundamental groupoid of XX. In that case the connection is called a flat connection.
More concrete picture
By Lie differentiation the functor tratra, i.e. by looking at what it does to very short pieces of paths, one obtains from it a splitting of the Atiyah Lie algebroid sequence, which is a morphism
∇:TX→at(P)
  \nabla : T X \to at(P)


of vector bundles. Locally on XX – meaning: when everything is pulled back to a cover Y→XY \to X of XX – this is a Lie(G)Lie(G)-valued 1-form A∈Ω 1(Y,Lie(G))A \in \Omega^1(Y, Lie(G)) with certain special properties.
In particular, since every GG-principal bundle canonically trivializes when pulled back to its own total space PP, a connection in this case gives rise to a 1-form A∈Ω 1(P)A \in \Omega^1(P) satisfying two conditions. This data is called an Ehresmann connection.
If instead P=EP = E is a vector bundle, then the two conditions satisfies by AA imply that it defines a linear map
∇:Γ(E)→Ω 1(X,E):=Γ(X,T X *⊗E)
  \nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Omega^1(X,E):=\Gamma(X,T_X^*\otimes E)


from the space Γ(E)\Gamma(E) of section of EE that satisfies the properties of a covariant derivative.
If again the connection is flat, then this is manifestly the datum of a Lie infinity-algebroid representation of the tangent Lie algebroid TXT X of XX on EE: it defines the action Lie algebroid which is the Lie version of the Lie groupoid classified by the parallel transport functor.
…
More abstract picture
Recall from the discussion at GG-principal bundle that the GG-bundle P→XP \to X is encoded in a a suitable morphism
X→BG
  X \to \mathbf{B}G


(namely a morphism in the right (infinity,1)-category which may be represented by an anafunctor).
It turns out that similarly suitable morphisms
P 1(X)→BG
  \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


encode in one step the GG-bundle together with its parallel transport functor.
This is described in great detail in the reference by Schreiber–Waldorf below.
(…am running out of time… )
In every cohesive (∞,1)-topos there is an intrinsic notion of ∞-Chern-Weil theory that gives rise to a notion of connection on principal ∞-bundles. We describe here details of the realization of this general abstract structure in the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids.
For GG an ∞-Lie group, a connection on a smooth GG-principal ∞-bundle is a structure that supports the Chern-Weil homomorphism in Smooth∞Grpd: it interpolates between the nonabelian cohomology class c∈H smooth 1(X,G)c \in H^1_{smooth}(X,G) of the bundle and the refinements to ordinary differential cohomology of its characteristic classes: the curvature characteristic classes.
This generalizes the notion of connection on a bundle and the ordinary Chern-Weil homomorphism in differential geometry.
See the Motivation section at Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd and the page ∞-Chern-Weil theory introduction for more background.
For braided ∞\infty-groups
Let H\mathbf{H} be a cohesive (∞,1)-topos equippd with differential cohesion and let 𝔾∈Grp(H)\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) be a braided ∞-group. Write
curv 𝔾=θ B𝔾:B𝔾→♭ dRB 2𝔾
  curv_{\mathbb{G}} = \theta_{\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}
  \to 
  \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}


for the Maurer-Cartan form on the delooping ∞-group B𝔾∈Grp(H)\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H}).
Let
Ω(−,𝔾)→♭ dRB 2𝔾
  \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})
  \to
  \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}


be the morphism out of a 0-truncated object which is universal with the property that for Σ∈H\Sigma \in \mathbf{H} any manifold, the induced internal hom map
[Σ,Ω(−,𝔾)]→[Σ,♭ dRB 2𝔾]
  [\Sigma, \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})]
  \to
  [\Sigma, \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}]


is a 1-epimorphism.
Then write B𝔾 conn\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} for the (∞,1)-pullback in
B𝔾 conn → Ω(−,𝔾) ↓  ↓ B𝔾 →curv 𝔾 ♭ dRB 2𝔾.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}
    &\to&
    \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})
    \\
    \downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}
    &\stackrel{curv_{\mathbb{G}}}{\to}&
    \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}
  }
  \,.


We say that B𝔾 conn\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} is the moduli ∞-stack of 𝔾\mathbb{G}-principal ∞\infty-connections.
For instance for 𝔾=B n−1U(1)\mathbb{G} = \mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1) the circle n-group the moduli nn-stack B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} is presented by the Deligne complex for ordinary differential cohomology in degree (n+1)(n+1), hence is the moduli nn-stack for circle n-bundles with connection.
For ∞\infty-groups obtained by Lie integration
We assume that the reader is familiar with the notation and constructions discussed at Smooth∞Grpd. The following definition may be understood as a direct generalization of the description of ordinary GG-connections as cocycles in the stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} as discussed at connection on a bundle, in view of the characterization of Weil algebra in the smooth infinity-topos

We discuss now connections on those GG-principal ∞-bundles for which G∈G \in  Smooth∞Grpd is an smooth ∞-group that arises from Lie integration of an L-∞ algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.
Let 𝔤∈L ∞↪CE\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty \stackrel{CE}{\hookrightarrow}  dgAlg op{}^{op} be an L-∞ algebra over the real numbers and of finite type with Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) and Weil algebra W(𝔤)W(\mathfrak{g}).
For XX a smooth manifold, write Ω •(X)∈dgAlg\Omega^\bullet(X) \in dgAlg for the de Rham complex of smooth differential forms. For k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} let Δ k\Delta^k be the standard kk-simplex regarded as a smooth manifold with corners in the standard way. Write Ω si •(X×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet_{si}(X \times \Delta^k) for the sub-dg-algebra of differential forms with sitting instants perpendicular to the boundary of the simplex, and Ω si,vert •(X×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(X\times \Delta^k) for the further sub-dg-algebra of vertical differential forms with respect to the canonical projection X×Δ k→XX \times \Delta^k \to X.

Definition
A morphism
Ω •(X)←W(𝔤):A
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  : 
  A


in dgAlg we call an L-∞ algebra valued differential form with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, dually a morphism of ∞-Lie algebroids
A:TX→inn(𝔤)
  A : T X \to inn(\mathfrak{g})


from the tangent Lie algebroid to the inner automorphism ∞-Lie algebra.
Its curvature is the composite of morphisms of graded vector spaces

  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{F_{(-)}}{\leftarrow}

that injects the shifted generators into the Weil algebra.
Precisely if the curvatures vanish does the morphism factor through the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra

     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(X) &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}& W(\mathfrak{g})     
  }
  \right)


in which case we call AA flat.
The curvature characteristic forms of AA are the composite
Ω •(X)←AW(𝔤)←⟨F (−)⟩inv(𝔤):⟨F A⟩,
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\langle F_{(-)} \rangle}{\leftarrow}
  inv(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  \langle F_A\rangle
  \,,


where inv(𝔤)→W(𝔤)inv(\mathfrak{g}) \to W(\mathfrak{g}) is the inclusion of the invariant polynomials.

We define now simplicial presheaves over the site CartSp smooth↪{}_{smooth} \hookrightarrow  SmoothMfd of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them.

Here on the right we have in each case the sets of horizontal morphisms in dgAlg that make commuting diagrams in dgAlg as indicated, with the vertical morphisms being the canonical projections and inclusions. The functoriality in f:K→Uf : K \to U and ρ:[k]→[l]\rho : [k] \to [l] is by the evident precomposition with the pullback of differential forms Ω •(U×Δ k)→(f,id) *Ω •(K×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k) \stackrel{(f,id)^*}{\to} \Omega^\bullet(K \times \Delta^k) and Ω •(U×Δ l)←(id,ρ) *Ω •(U,×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^l) \stackrel{(id,\rho)^*}{\leftarrow} \Omega^\bullet(U, \times \Delta^k).

Proposition
There are canonical morphisms in [CartSp smooth op,sSet][CartSp_{smooth}^{op},sSet] between these objects
exp(𝔤) conn ↪ exp(𝔤) ChW ↪ exp(𝔤) diff     ↓     exp(𝔤),
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
    &\hookrightarrow&
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW}
    &\hookrightarrow&
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}
    \\
    && && \downarrow
    \\
    && && \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  }
  \,,


where the horizontal morphisms are monomorphisms of simplicial presheaves and the vertical morphism is over each U∈CartSpU \in CartSp an equivalence of Kan complexes (it is a weak equivalence between fibrant objects in the projective model structure on simplicial presheaves).


Proof
The inclusion exp(𝔤) ChW↪exp(𝔤) dff\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} \hookrightarrow \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{dff} is clear. The weak equivalence exp(𝔤) diff→exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} \to \exp(\mathfrak{g}) is discussed at Smooth∞Grpd (but is also directly verified).
To see the inclusion exp(𝔤) conn↪exp(𝔤) ChW\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \hookrightarrow \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} we need to check that the horizonality condition ι vF A=0\iota_v F_A = 0 on the curvature of a 𝔤\mathfrak{g}-valued form AA for all vector fields vv tangent to the simplex implies that all the curvature characteristic forms ⟨F A⟩\langle F_A\rangle are basic forms that “descend to UU”, hence that are in the image of the inclusion Ω •(U)→Ω si •(U×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U) \to \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k).
For this it is sufficient to show that for all v∈Γ(TΔ k)v \in \Gamma(T \Delta^k) we have


ι v⟨F A⟩=0\iota_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0;


ℒ v⟨F A⟩=0\mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0


where in the second line we have the Lie derivative ℒ v\mathcal{L}_v along vv.
The first condition is evidently satisfied if already ι vF A=0\iota_v F_A = 0. The second condition follows with Cartan calculus and using that d dR⟨F A⟩=0d_{dR} \langle F_A\rangle = 0 (which holds as a consequence of the definition of invariant polynomial):
ℒ v⟨F A⟩=dι v⟨F A⟩+ι vd⟨F A⟩=0.
  \mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 
  d \iota_v \langle F_A \rangle
  + 
  \iota_v d \langle F_A \rangle
  = 0
  \,.



Remark
For a general L-∞ algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} the curvature forms F AF_A themselves are not necessarily closed (rather they satisfy the Bianchi identity), hence requiring them to have no component along the simplex does not imply that they descend. This is different for abelian L-∞ algebras: for them the curvature forms themselves are already closed, and hence are themselves already curvature characteristics that do descent.

For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} let cosk n+1:sSet→sSet\mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} : sSet \to sSet be the simplicial coskeleton functor. Its prolongation to simplicial presheaves we denote here τ n\tau_n and write
τ nexp(𝔤)∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]
 \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]


etc. This is the delooping
τ nexp(𝔤)=BG
  \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g}) = \mathbf{B}G


of the universal Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} to an smooth n-group GG.

Definition
For any X∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]X \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] and X^→X\hat X \to X any cofibrant resolution in the local projective model structure on simplicial presheaves (see Smooth∞Grpd for details), we say that the sSet-hom object


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤))[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX;


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤) diff)[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX equipped with pseudo ∞\infty-connection;


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤) conn)[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX equipped with ∞\infty-connection.




Remark
In view of this definition we may read the above sequence of morpisms of coefficient objects as follows:
exp(𝔤) conn   genuineconnections ↓ exp(𝔤) ChW   pseudo−connectionwithglobalcurvaturecharacteristics ↓ exp(𝔤) diff   pseudo−connections ↓ ≃ exp(𝔤)   barebundles,

    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &&& bare bundles
  }
  \,,


As we shall see in more detail below, the components of an ∞\infty-connection in terms of the above diagrams we may think of as follows:
Ω •(U×Δ k) vert ←A vert CE(𝔤)   gaugetransformation ↑  ↑ Ω •(U×Δ k) ←A W(𝔤)   𝔤−valuedform ↑  ↑ Ω •(U) ←⟨F A⟩ inv(𝔤)   curvaturecharacteristicforms

      &\stackrel{\langle F_A\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
      inv(\mathfrak{g})
      &&&
      curvature\;characteristic\;forms
    }



Remark
In full Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd the fundamental object of interest is really exp(𝔤) diff\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} – the object of pseudo-connections, which serves as the correspondence object for an ∞-anafunctor out of exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g}) that presents the differential characteristic classes on exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g}). From an abstract point of view the other objects only serve the purpose of picking particularly nice representatives.
This distinction is important: over objects X∈X \in  Smooth∞Grpd that are not smooth manifolds but for instance orbifolds, the genuine 𝔤\mathfrak{g}-connections for general higher 𝔤\mathfrak{g} do not exhaust all nonabelian differential cocycles. This just means that not every differential class in this case does have a nice representative.

Differential cohomology is a refinement of plain cohomology such that a differential cocycle is to its underlying ordinary cocycle as a bundle with connection is to its underlying bundle.
The best known version of differential cohomology is a differential refinement of generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology, hence of cohomology in stable homotopy theory (as opposed to more general nonabelian cohomology). For ordinary cohomology the refinement to ordinary differential cohomology is modeled for instance by complex line bundles with connection on a bundle, bundle gerbes with connection, etc, and generally by Deligne cohomology. Similarly, differential refinements of topological K-theory to differential K-theory may be presented by vector bundles with connection (e.g Simons-Sullivan 08).
A systematic characterization and construction of differential generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology in terms of suitable homotopy fiber products of the mapping spectra representing the underlying cohomology theory with differential form data was then given in (Hopkins-Singer 02) (motivated by discussion of the quantization of the M5-brane via holographically dual 7d Chern-Simons theory by Edward Witten).
In this stable case one characteristic property of differential cohomology that was first observed empirically in ordinary differential cohomology (Simons-Sullivan 07) and differential K-theory (Simons-Sullivan 08) is that it is a kind of cohomology theory which fits into a differential cohomology diagram which is an interlocking system of two fiber sequences that expresses how the data of a geometric bundle with connection may be decomposed into the underlying bundle and the curvature of the connection and how connections on trivial bundles as well as bundles with flat connections are examples of the general concept. (The homotopy fiber product used in (Hopkins-Singer 02) provides one of the two commuting squares in this diagram.)
Schematically the characteristic differential cohomology hexagon (see there for details) looks as follows
  connectionontrivialbundle  ⟶deRhamdifferential  differentialforms  ↗  ↘  ↗ curvature  ↘ flatdifferentialforms    geometricbundlewithconnection    rationalshapeofbundle  ↘  ↗  ↘   ↗ Cherncharacter   geometricbundlewithflatconnection  ⟶forgetconnection  shapeofbundle

    \\

    \\
    && geometric\;bundle\;with\;flat\;connection && \underset{forget\;connection}{\longrightarrow} && shape\;of\;bundle
  }


It turns out that such differential cohomology diagrams are exactly what all stable homotopy types in cohesive (∞,1)-toposes H\mathbf{H} naturally sit in (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13). All the traditional differential cohomology theories and their joint generalization due to (Hopkins-Singer 02) are special cases of this for the case that H=TSmooth∞Grpd\mathbf{H} = T Smooth \infty Grpd is the tangent cohesive (∞,1)-topos of that of smooth ∞-groupoids (∞-stacks over the site of smooth manifolds).
It is therefore natural to define differential cohomology to be the intrinsic cohomology of cohesive (∞,1)-toposes. (Notice that while the differential cohomology diagram itself only involves the shape modality and the flat modality of cohesion, the sharp modality is needed to produce, via differential concretification, the correct moduli stacks of differential cocycles over a given base object from the mapping stack of that into the representing stable homotopy type).
Viewed in this generality, differential cohomology makes sense for instance also in supergeometry where it subsumes structures such as super line 2-bundles and more generally higher super gerbes with connection, which naturally appear as differential refinements of the geometric twists of (differential) K-theory and tmf.
Ordinary differential cohomology is the differential cohomology-refinement of ordinary cohomology, for instance realized as singular cohomology.
Every generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology-theory has a refinement to differential cohomology. By ordinary differential cohomology one refers, for emphasis, to the differential refinement of ordinary integral cohomology , hence of the cohomology theory represented by the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum K(−,ℤ)K(-,\mathbb{Z}). To the extent that integral cohomology is often just called cohomology when the context is clear, ordinary differential cohomology is often called just differential cohomology .
Ordinary differential cohomology classifies circle n-bundles with connection. In low degree these are ordinary circle bundles with connection. In the next degree they are circle 2-group principal 2-bundles / bundle gerbes with 2-connection.
Here we write H diff •(X)H_{diff}^\bullet(X) for the ordinary differential cohomology groups of a smooth manifold XX.
Curvature and characteristic class
There are two natural morphisms:


The underlying characteristic class
c:H diff •(X)→H •(X,ℤ)
  c : H_{diff}^\bullet(X) \to H^\bullet(X,\mathbb{Z})


produces the class in integral cohomology that underlies a differential cocycle;


for H diff 2(X)H^2_{diff}(X) this is called the first Chern class of a line bundle;


for H diff 3(X)H^3_{diff}(X) this is called the Dixmier-Douady class of the corresponding bundle gerbe.




The curvature
F:H diff •(X)→Ω cl •(X)
 F : H_{diff}^\bullet(X) \to \Omega^\bullet_{cl}(X)


produces a closed differential form of degree nn. This happens to land in closed differential forms with integral periods (see below).


The following is either a definition, if regarded as an axiomatic characterization of ordinary differential cohomology, or it is a proposition, if regarded as a property of one of the models.
Let XX be a smooth manifold and n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} with n≥1n \geq 1 Write


H diff n(X)H_{diff}^n(X) for the ordinary differential cohomology of XX in degree nn;


Ω n−1(X)\Omega^{n-1}(X) for the collection of differential forms of degree n−1n-1;


Ω int n−1(X)\Omega^{n-1}_{int}(X) for the collection of differential forms ω\omega of degree n−1n-1 that are closed and whose periods are integral: for every γ:S n−1→X\gamma : S^{n-1} \to X we have the integral ∫ S n−1γ *ω∈ℤ↪ℝ\int_{S^{n-1}} \gamma^* \omega \in \mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}. Similarly for Ω int n(X)\Omega^n_{int}(X).


H n(X,ℤ)H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}) and H n(X,U(1))H^n(X, U(1)) for the ordinary cohomology (for instance modeled as singular cohomology) of XX with coefficients in the integers or the circle group (regarded as a discrete group), respectively.


All of these sets are abelian groups: the forms under addition of forms, and the differential cohomology classes are defined or proven (depending on the approach, see above) to have abelian group structure such that the maps to curvatures and characteristic classes, from above are homomorphisms of abelian groups.

Proposition
The differential cohomology H diff n(X)H_{diff}^n(X) of XX fits into short exact sequences of abelian groups


curvature exact sequence
(1)0→H n−1(X,U(1))→H diff n(X)→FΩ int n(X)→0
  
  0 \to H^{n-1}(X, U(1)) \to H^n_{diff}(X) \stackrel{F}{\to} \Omega_{int}^n(X) \to 0



characteristic class exact sequence
(2)0→Ω n−1(X)/Ω int n−1(X)→H diff n(X)→cH n(X,ℤ)→0.
   
   0 
    \to 
   \Omega^{n-1}(X)/\Omega^{n-1}_{int}(X)
    \to
   H_{diff}^n(X)
    \stackrel{c}{\to} 
   H^n(X, \mathbb{Z})
    \to
   0 
   \,.




The first sequence (1) says in words: two circle (n−1)(n-1)-bundles nn whose curvature coincides differ by a flat circle (n-1)-bundle.
The second sequence (2) says in words: two connections on the same circle (n−1)(n-1)-bundle differ by a globally defined connection (n−1)(n-1)-form, well defined up to addition of a form with integral periods.
More is true: both these sequences interlock to form the hexagonal differential cohomology diagram of ordinary differential cohomology. For more see at differential cohomology diagram – Examples – Deligne coefficients.
Models
There are various equivalent cocycle-models for ordinary differential cohomology. They include


Cheeger-Simons differential characters;


Deligne cohomology;


circle n-bundles with connection.


The last of these are often known as U(1)U(1)-gerbes or bundle gerbes with connection.
Cocycles ∇∈H diff 2(X)\nabla \in H_{diff}^2(X) in degree 2 ordinary differential cohomology are represented by ordinary circle group-principal bundles with connection on XX. The class c(∇)∈H 2(X,ℤ)c(\nabla) \in H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}) is the Chern class of the underlying circle bundle and the form F ∇∈Ω cl 2(X)F_\nabla \in \Omega^2_{cl}(X) is the curvature 2-form of the connection ∇\nabla.
Deligne cohomology – or Deligne-Beilinson cohomology – is an abelian sheaf cohomology that models ordinary differential cohomology, a refinement of the sheaf cohomology with coefficients in a locally constant abelian sheaf (modeling ordinary cohomology) by differential form data.
The Deligne complex is like a truncated de Rham complex but, crucially, with the sheaf of 0-forms – the structure sheaf 𝒪\mathcal{O} - replaced by the multiplicative group 𝒪 ×\mathcal{O}^\times under the exponential map
[𝒪 ×⟶dlogΩ 1⟶dΩ 2⟶d⋯⟶dΩ n].
  \left[
     \mathcal{O}^\times
     \stackrel{d log}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^1
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^2
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \cdots
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^n
  \right]
  \,.


Deligne cohomology H conn n+1(X,ℤ)H^{n+1}_{conn}(X, \mathbb{Z}) in degree (n+1)(n+1) is the abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in this chain complex of sheaves of abelian groups (“hypercohomology”).
This was introduced in (Deligne 71, Section 2.2) in the context of analytic geometry (hence using holomorphic differential forms) as a Hodge-filtered version of singular cohomology, designed to be a target for the Beilinson regulator from motivic cohomology. But the form of the definition applies more generally, in particular also in smooth differential geometry, a fact amplified and popularized in (Brylinski 93).
In smooth differential geometry the typical minor variant has the sheaf U̲(1)=C ∞(−,U(1))\underline{U}(1) = C^\infty(-,U(1)) of circle group-valued smooth functions in degree nn:
[C ∞(−,U(1))⟶dlogΩ 1⟶dΩ 2⟶d⋯⟶dΩ n].
  \left[
     C^\infty(-,U(1))
     \stackrel{d log}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^1
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^2
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \cdots
     \stackrel{d}{\longrightarrow}
     \Omega^n
  \right]
  \,.


Given any manifold XX, then the resulting complex of abelian groups is, under the Dold-Kan correspondence, the n-groupoid of circle n-bundles with connection whose underlying circle (n-1)-group-principal infinity-bundle is trivialized. Passing to the abelian sheaf cohomology implicitly corresponds to considering the infinity-stackification of this nn-groupoid valued presheaf, and in this way Deligne cohomology computes equivalence classes of circle n-bundles with connection. Another way to say this is that under the Dold-Kan correspondence and infinity-stackification, the above Deligne complex defines a smooth infinity-stack B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} which is the universal moduli infinity-stack for circle n-bundles with connection, and Deligne cohomology computes the homotopy classes of maps (of infinity-stacks) into this (FSS 10)
H conn n+1(X,ℤ)≃π 0(X→B nU(1) conn).
  H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \simeq
  \pi_0(X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})
  \,.


In this way Deligne cohomology, or rather the collection of Deligne cocycles with coefficients in the Deligne complex that defines it, is considerably richer than other models for ordinary differential cohomology such as Cheeger-Simons differential characters, which see only the cohomology group, but not the full moduli n-stack.
Explicitly, computing the abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in the Deligne complex via Cech cohomology gives that a cocycle A¯\overline{A} on some space XX is represented with respect to a suitable open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} by a collection of differential forms and functions
A¯={A i 0,⋯,i k∈Ω n−k(U i 0,⋯i k)} k=0 n∪{g i 0,⋯,i n∈𝒪 ×(U i 0,⋯,i n+1)}
  \overline{A}
  = 
  \left\{
     A_{i_0, \cdots, i_k}
     \in \Omega^{n-k}(U_{i_0, \cdots i_k})
  \right\}_{k = 0}^{n}
  \cup
  \{
     g_{i_0, \cdots, i_n} \in \mathcal{O}^\times(U_{i_0, \cdots, i_{n+1}})
  \}


such that the failure of the (n−k+1)(n-k+1)-forms to glue on (k+1)(k+1)-fold intersections of charts is given by the de Rham differential of the (n−k)(n-k)-forms
∑ j=0 k(−1) jA i 0,⋯,i j−1,i j+1,⋯,i k+1=d dRA i 0,⋯,i k+1.
  \sum_{j = 0}^k
  (-1)^j
  A_{i_0, \cdots, i_{j-1}, i_{j+1}, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
  =
  d_{dR} A_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
  \,.


This evidently generalizes the familiar Cech cocycle data for traditional line bundles with connection.
As the notation indicates, Deligne cohomology is a differential cohomology refinement of ordinary cohomology with integer coefficients, exhibited by a canonical forgetful map
H conn n+1(X,ℤ)  ↘   H n+1(X,ℤ)
  \array{
    H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    && H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})   
  }


which is induced by the evident morphism of chain complexes. This is one map in an exact differential hexagon which exhibits Deligne cohomology as the differential refinement of ordinary integral cohomology by closed curvature differential form data.

In any context where these symbols make the evident sense, the Deligne complex of degree (n+1)(n+1) is the chain complex 𝒪 ×→dlogΩ 1→dΩ 2→⋯→Ω n\mathcal{O}^\times \stackrel{d log}{\to}\Omega^1 \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^2 \to \cdots \to \Omega^n, and Deligne cohomology in degree (n+1)(n+1) is the abelian sheaf cohomology with coefficients in this complex.
More generally one considers any discrete group AA and inclusion A↪𝒪A \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O} into the structure sheaf, then the corresponding Deligne complex is A↪𝒪→dΩ 1→⋯→Ω nA \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O} \stackrel{d}{\to} \Omega^1 \to \cdots \to \Omega^n.
For definiteness we consider here in detail the Deligne complex in the context of differential geometry modeled on smooth manifolds. All variants work essentially directly analogously, but it may be useful to have a specific case in hand. This discussion overlaps with and is put into a broader context at geometry of physics – principal connections.
Preliminaries on sheaf cohomology
In order to be somewhat self-contained, this section reviews some elements of abelian sheaf cohomology specified to the context that we need. It also sets up some notation. The definition of the Deligne complex itself is below in def. .

Definition
Write CartSp for the site whose


objects are Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N},


morphisms are smooth functions ℝ n 1→ℝ n 2\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2} between these;


whose coverage is given by “differentially good open covers”, those open covers of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^ns all whose finite non-empty intersections are diffeomorphic to an open ball, hence again to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.


Write PSh(CartSp)=Func(CartSp op,Set)PSh(CartSp) = Func(CartSp^{op},Set) for the category of presheaves over this site. Write
Smooth0Type≔Sh(CartSp)
  Smooth0Type \coloneqq Sh(CartSp)


for its category of sheaves, also called the cohesive topos of smooth spaces.


Remark
Instead of the site CartSp of def.  one could use the site SmoothMfd of all smooth manifolds. All of the statements and constructions in the following go through in that case just as well. In fact CartSp is a dense subsite of SmoothMfd. On the one hand this implies that the abelian sheaf cohomology is the same for both sites, but on the other hand means that it is convenient to restrict to the much “smaller” site of Cartesian spaces. In fact since the stalks of sheaves over smooth manifolds are evaluations on small open balls and since every open ball is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space, many statements that are true (only) stalkwise over SmoothMfd are actually true globally over CartSpCartSp. It is the “descent” or “infinity-stackification” which is implicit in abelian sheaf cohomology that takes care of these global statements over CartSp to translate into the same local statements as one gets over SmoothMfd.


Example
The assignment C ∞(−,ℝ):ℝ n↦C ∞(ℝ n,ℝ)C^\infty(-,\mathbb{R}) \colon \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}) of smooth functions with values in the real numbers is a sheaf. Since this is representable we are entitled to identify this with the smooth manifold ℝ\mathbb{R} (the real line) itself, and just write ℝ∈Smooth0Type\mathbb{R} \in Smooth0Type.
Similarly for XX any other smooth manifold, it represents a sheaf on CartSp and we just write X∈Smooth0TypeX \in Smooth0Type for this.
Of particular interest below is the case where X=S 1=ℝ/ℤ=U(1)X = S^1 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z} = U(1) is the circle, to be regarded as the circle group.
Notice that traditionally the sheaf represented by ℝ\mathbb{R} or U(1)U(1) is indicated by an underline as in ℝ̲\underline{\mathbb{R}} and U̲(1)\underline{U}(1), but we do not follow this tradition here.
Instead, if we consider the other sheaf that might deserve to be denoted by ℝ\mathbb{R}, namely the constant sheaf on ℝ\mathbb{R}, which sends each U∈CartSpU \in CartSp to the set underlying ℝ\mathbb{R}, then we write ♭ℝ\flat \mathbb{R} for that. Similarly
♭U(1)∈Smooth0Type
  \flat U(1) \in Smooth0Type


is the sheaf sending each test manifold to the set of points in the circle, and each smooth function between Cartesian spaces to the identity function on that set.


Example
For k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} write
Ω k∈Sh(CartSp)
  \mathbf{\Omega}^k \in Sh(CartSp)


for the sheaf Ω k:U↦Ω k(U)\mathbf{\Omega}^k \colon U \mapsto \Omega^k(U) of smooth differential k-forms on XX. The de Rham differential extends to a morphism of sheaves
d:Ω k→Ω k+1.
  \mathbf{d} \colon \mathbf{\Omega}^k \to \mathbf{\Omega}^{k+1}
  \,.


For positive kk its kernel is the sub-sheaf
0→Ω cl k↪Ω k⟶dΩ k+1
  0 \to 
  \mathbf{\Omega}^k_{cl} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{\Omega}^k
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{\Omega}^{k+1}


of closed differential forms; and for k=0k = 0 its kernel is the sub-sheaf of constant functions

In the background, what plays a role for the following is the full cohesive homotopy theory of smooth ∞-groupoids. This receives a map from the following coarse homotopy theory of chain complexes of abelian sheaves, which is all that is necessary for the present purpose.

Definition
Write
Ch +(Smooth0Type)=Ch +(Sh(CartSp))=Sh(CartSp,Ch +)
  Ch_+(Smooth0Type)
  =
  Ch_+(Sh(CartSp))
  =
  Sh(CartSp,Ch_+)


for the category of chain complexes in the smooth sheaves of def. , hence for the 1-category whose objects are chain complexes of abelian sheaves on CartSpCartSp.
Regard this as equipped with the structure of a category of fibrant objects induced by the projective model structure on chain complexes, hence with classes of morphisms labeled as follows: a chain map f •:A •→B •f_\bullet \colon A_\bullet \to B_\bullet is called


a weak equivalence if it is a quasi-isomorphism, hence if it induces isomorphisms on (sheaves of) chain homology groups;


a fibration if it is an epimorphism (of abelian sheaves) in positive degree.




Remark
For our purpose the main use of this structure is to compute homotopy fibers via the factorization lemma. Namely


every chain map may be replaced, up to weak equivalence of its domain, by a fibration;


the homotopy fiber of a chain map is the ordinary fiber of any of its fibration replacements.




Remark
That the properties in def.  are interpreted in sheaves simply means that they apply stalk-wise. For instance a morphism of chain complexes of presheaves f •:A •→B •f_\bullet \colon A_\bullet \to B_\bullet is a weak equivalence precisely if the underlying presheaf of chain complexes becomes a quasi-isomorphism for each point xx in each Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n after restricting (via the presheaf structure maps) to a small enough open neighbourhood of that point. Similarly for epimorphisms.


Remark
There is a canonical map of homotopy theories from Ch +(Smooth0Type)Ch_+(Smooth0Type) to the full (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd which is given by applying the Dold-Kan correspondence followed by ∞-stackification. The key point is that this map preserves homotopy fiber products, which is the universal construction that already captures most of the relevant properties of the Deligne complex. In this way it is sufficient to concentrate on Ch +(Smooth0Type)Ch_+(Smooth0Type) for much of the theory.

When writing out the components of chain complexes we will use square brackets always denote the group in degree-0 to the far right, and the group in degree kk being kk steps to the left from that.

Example
For A∈Ab(Smooth0Type)=Sh(CartSp,Ab)A \in Ab(Smooth0Type) = Sh(CartSp,Ab) any abelian sheaf and for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} we write
(B nA) •≔A[−n]=[A→0→⋯→0]
  (\mathbf{B}^n A)_{\bullet}
  \coloneqq
  A[-n]
  =
  \left[
     A

     \to 0 \to \cdots \to 0
  \right]


for the chain complex of sheaves concentrated on AA in degree nn.


Example
There is a weak equivalence, def. ,
[ℤ→ℝ]⟶≃U(1)
  \left[\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R} \right]
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  U(1)


given by the chain map
ℤ ↪ ℝ ↓  ↓ modℤ 0 → U(1)
  \array{
     \mathbb{Z} &\hookrightarrow& \mathbb{R}
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{mod\,\mathbb{Z}}}
     \\
     0 &\to& U(1)
  }


(which is just the exponential sequence regarded as a chain map). That this is a weak equivalence is the statement that every smooth U(1)U(1)-valued function is locally the quotient of a smooth ℝ\mathbb{R}-valued function by a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-valued function. In fact on Cartesian spaces this is of course true even globally.
The de Rham differential extends through this equivalence to produce a morphism denoted dlog\mathbf{d} log:
(ℤ→ℝ) ⟶d Ω 1 ↓ ≃ ↗ dlog U(1).
  \array{
    (\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}) &\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^1
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{\mathbf{d} log}}
    \\
    U(1) 
    \,.
  }


On a given U(1)U(1)-valued function this is given by representing the function by a smooth ℝ\mathbb{R}-valued function under mod-ℤ\mathbb{Z}-reduction (which is always possible over a Cartesian space) and applying the de Rham differential to that.
The kernel of that is the constant sheaf ♭U(1)\flat U(1) of example 
0→♭U(1)↪U(1)⟶dlogΩ 1.
  0 \to
  \flat U(1) \hookrightarrow U(1)
  \stackrel{\mathbf{d} log}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{\Omega}^1
  \,.


Under addition of differential forms, the sheaves Ω k\mathbf{\Omega}^k of example  becomes abelian sheaves, and we will implicitly understand them this way now.

Definition
Write (♭B n+1ℝ)^ •∈Ch(Smooth0Type)\widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})}_\bullet \in Ch(Smooth0Type) for the complex of sheaves given by the truncated de Rham complex:
(♭B n+1ℝ)^ •≔[ℝ→dΩ 1→dΩ 2→d⋯→dΩ cl n+1].
  \widehat{(\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})}_\bullet
  \coloneqq
  \left[
    \mathbb{R}

    \cdots    
    \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{n+1}_{cl}
  \right]
  \,.

  (\flat \mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{R})_\bullet

given by the canonical chain map
♭ℝ → 0 → 0 → ⋯ → 0 ↓  ↓  ↓  ⋯  ↓ ℝ →d Ω 1 →d Ω 2 →d ⋯ →d Ω cl n+1

    &\stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}&
    \mathbf{\Omega}^{n+1}_{cl}
  }


is a weak equivalence in the sense of def. .


Proof
By the Poincaré lemma. This is the Poincaré Lemma.

Every A •∈Ch +(Smooth0Type)A_\bullet \in Ch_+(Smooth0Type) serves as the coefficients for an abelian sheaf cohomology theory on smooth manifolds. Abelian sheaf cohomology has a general abstract characterization (see at cohomology) in terms of derived hom-spaces. For definiteness, we recall the model for this construction given by Cech cohomology .

Definition
(Čech complex)
Let XX be a smooth manifold and let A •∈Ch +(Smooth0Type)A_\bullet \in Ch_+(Smooth0Type) be a sheaf of chain complexes. Let {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} be a good open cover of XX, i.e. an open cover such that each finite non-empty intersection U i 0,⋯,i kU_{i_0, \cdots, i_k} is diffeomorphic to an open ball/Cartesian space.
The Čech cochain complex C •((X,{U i}),A •)C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet) of XX with respect to the cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} and with coefficients in A •A_\bullet is in degree k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} given by the abelian group
C k((X,{U i}),A •)≔⊕ l,nk=n−l⊕ i 0,i 1,⋯,i nA l(U i 0,⋯,i n)
  C^k((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \oplus_{{l,n} \atop {k = n-l}}
  \oplus_{i_0, i_1, \cdots, i_n}
  A_l(U_{i_0, \cdots, i_n})


which is the direct sum of the values of A •A_\bullet on the given intersections as indicated; and whose differential
d:C k((X,{U i}),A •)⟶C k+1((X,{U i}),A •)
  d
  \colon
  C^{k}((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)
  \longrightarrow
  C^{k+1}((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet)


is defined componentwise (see at matrix calculus for conventions on maps between direct sums) by
(da) i 0,⋯,i k+1 ≔(∂ Aa+(−1) kδa) i 0,⋯,i k+1  ≔∂ Aa i 0,⋯,i k+1+(−1) k∑ 0≤j≤k+1(−1) ja i 0,⋯,i j−1,i j+1,⋯,i k+1| U i 0,⋯,i k+1
  \begin{aligned}
    (d a)_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    & \coloneqq 
    (\partial_A a + (-1)^k \delta a)_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    \\
    & \coloneqq
    \partial_A a_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}
    +
    (-1)^k
    \sum_{0 \leq j \leq k+1} (-1)^{j}
    a_{i_0, \cdots, i_{j-1}, i_{j+1}, \cdots, i_{k+1}} 
    |_{U_{i_0, \cdots, i_{k+1}}}
  \end{aligned}


where on the right the sum is over all components of aa obtained via the canonical restrictions obtained by discarding one of the original (k+1)(k+1) subscripts.
The Cech cohomology groups of XX with coefficients in A •A_\bullet relative to the given cover are the chain homology groups of the Cech complex
H Cech k((X,{U i}),A •)≔H k(C •((X,{U i}),A •)).
  H_{Cech}^k((X,\{U_i\}), A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  H^k(C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet))
  \,.


The Cech cohomology groups as such are the colimit (“direct limit”) of these groups over refinements of covers
H Cech k(X,A •)≔lim⟶ {U i→X}H Cech k((X,{U i}),A •).
  H^k_{Cech}(X, A_\bullet)
  \coloneqq
  \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{\{U_i \to X\}}
  H_{Cech}^k((X,\{U_i\}), A_\bullet)
  \,.



Remark
Often Cech cohomology is considered for the case that A •A_\bullet is concentrated in a single degree, in which case the first term in the sum defining the differential in def.  disappears. When A •A_\bullet is not concentrated in a single degree, then for emphasis one sometimes speaks of hypercohomology. This is the case of relevance for Deligne cohomology.


Remark
The Cech chain complex in def.  is the total complex of the double complex whose vertical differential is that of A •A_\bullet and whose horizontal differential is the Cech differential δ\delta given by alternating sums over restrictions along patch inclusions
⋮  ⋮ ↓ ∂ A  ↓ ∂ A ⊕ iA 1(U i 0) ⟶δ ⊕ i 0,i 1A 1(U i 0,i 1) ⟶δ ⋯ ↓ ∂ A  ↓ ∂ A ⊕ iA 0(U i) ⟶δ ⊕ i 0,i 1A 0(U i 0,i 1) ⟶δ ⋯
  \array{
     \vdots && \vdots
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_A}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_A}}
     \\
     \oplus_i A_1(U_{i_0})
     &\stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
     \oplus_{i_0, i_1} A_1(U_{i_0, i_1})
     &\stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
     \cdots
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_A}}
     &&
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\partial_A}}
     \\
     \oplus_i A_0(U_i)
     &\stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
     \oplus_{i_0, i_1} A_0(U_{i_0, i_1})
     &\stackrel{\delta}{\longrightarrow}&
     \cdots
  }



Remark
For analyzing the properties of Deligne cohomology below, all one needs is the following fact about Cech cohomology, which is discussed for instance at infinity-cohesive site:
For XX a smooth manifold (in particular paracompact),


XX admits a good open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} (by charts U iU_i all whose finite non-empty intersections are diffeomorphic to an open ball/Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n);


for any such good open cover the Cech complex C •((X,{U i}),A •)C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),A_\bullet) already computes Cech cohomology (i.e. there is no further need to form the colimit of Cech complexes over refinements of covers);


the functor C •((X,{U i}),−):Ch +(Smooth0Type)→Ch +C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}),-) \colon Ch_+(Smooth0Type) \to Ch_+ preserves weak equivalences and fibrations.


This means in particular that if X •→Y •→Z •X_\bullet \to Y_\bullet \to Z_\bullet is a homotopy fiber sequence in Ch +(Smooth0Type)Ch_+(Smooth0Type), then also
C •((X,{U i}),X •)→C •((X,{U i}),Y •)→C •((X,{U i}),Z •)
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), X_\bullet) 
    \to 
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), Y_\bullet)
    \to 
  C^\bullet((X,\{U_i\}), Z_\bullet)


is a homotopy fiber sequence of chain complexes, and therefore the cohomology groups sit in the long exact sequence in homology of this sequence of chain complexes.


Example
For A •=(B n+1ℤ) •A_\bullet = (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet as in example , then for XX a smooth manifold
H Cech 0(X,(B n+1ℤ) •)≃H n+1(X,ℤ)
  H^0_{Cech}(X, (\mathbf{B}^{n+1}\mathbb{Z})_\bullet)
  \simeq
  H^{n+1}(X,\mathbb{Z})  


is the ordinary cohomology of XX with integer coefficients, the cohomology which is also computed as the singular cohomology of the underlying topological space of XX.
Similarly for A •=(♭B nU(1)) •A_\bullet = (\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))_{\bullet} then
H Cech 0(X,(♭B nU(1)) •)≃H n(X,U(1))
  H^0_{Cech}(X, (\flat\mathbf{B}^{n}U(1))_\bullet)
  \simeq
  H^{n}(X,U(1))  


is the ordinary cohomology of XX with circle group coefficients, the cohomology which is also computed as the singular cohomology of the underlying topological space of XX with U(1)U(1)-coefficients.


Example
Passing to abelian sheaf cohomology (e.g. via def. ), then prop.  is the de Rham theorem.

We will have need to give names to truncations of the de Rham complex. One is this:

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} write
Ω •≤n∈Ch +(Smooth0Type)
  \mathbf{\Omega}^{\bullet \leq n} \in Ch_+(Smooth0Type)


for the chain complex of the form
Ω •≤n≔[ℝ→dΩ 1→d⋯→dΩ n−1→dΩ n]
  \mathbf{\Omega}^{\bullet \leq n}
  \coloneqq
  \left[
     \mathbb{R}
     \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
     \mathbf{\Omega}^1 
     \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
     \cdots
     \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
     \mathbf{\Omega}^{n-1}
     \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
     \mathbf{\Omega}^{n}
  \right]


with all nn-forms, not just the closed ones, in degree 0.


Example
The abelian sheaf cohomology of the truncated de Rham complex in def.  is Ω n(X)/im(d)\Omega^n(X)/im(\mathbf{d}).

The Deligne complex

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} the smooth Deligne complex of degree nn
(B nU(1) conn) •∈Ch +(Smooth0Type)
  (\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})_\bullet
  \in 
  Ch_+(Smooth0Type)


is the chain complex of abelian sheaves given by
(B nU(1) conn) •≔[U(1)→dlogΩ 1→d⋯→dΩ n]
  (\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})_\bullet
  \;
   \coloneqq
  \;
  \left[
    U(1) \stackrel{\mathbf{d} log}{\to}
    \mathbf{\Omega}^1
    \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to} 
     \cdots 
    \stackrel{\mathbf{d}}{\to}
    \mathbf{\Omega}^n
  \right]


with U(1)U(1) in degree nn and with the differentials as in def.  and example .
We write
H conn n+1(X,ℤ)≔H Cech 0(X,(B nU(1) conn) •)
  H^{n+1}_{conn}(X,\mathbb{Z})
  \coloneqq
  H^0_{Cech}(X,(\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn})_\bullet)


for its abelian sheaf cohomology.


Remark
By example  the obvious chain map

is a weak equivalence, def. , and one could define the top chain complex here as “the” Deligne complex, just as well. In the context of homotopy theory/homological algebra, all that matters is the complex up to zig-zags of weak equivalences.


Remark
In def.  the de Rham complex is truncated to the right by discarding what would be the next differentials, without passing to their kernel, i.e. in degree 0 the Deligne complex has all differential nn-forms, not just the closed nn-fomrs. This simple point is the key aspect of the Deligne complex. If one instead truncates while preserving the chain homology in the lowest degree, then one obtains the following complex with the sheaf Ω cl n\mathbf{\Omega}^{n}_{cl} of closed forms in lowest degree, which gives ordinary cohomology.


Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} the flat smooth Deligne complex of degree nn
(B nU(1) flat) •∈Ch +(Smooth0Type)
  (\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{flat})_\bullet

    \mathbf{\Omega}^n_{cl}
  \right]


with U(1)U(1) in degree nn and with the differentials as in def.  and example , and with the closed nn-forms on the right.


Definition
Write

  (\mathbf{B}^n \flat U(1))_\bullet

Proposition
For (♭B nU(1)) •(\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))_\bullet as in def. , then the morphism

  (\flat \mathbf{B}^n U(1))_\bullet

  (\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{flat})_\bullet

(with the vertical morphism on the left being the inclusion of example ) is a weak equivalence, def. .


Proof
By the Poincaré lemma, this is just an immediate variant of prop. .

Cup product in Deligne cohomology
The cup product on ordinary cohomology refines to Deligne cohomology.
For more on this see at Beilinson-Deligne cup-product.
Differential K-theory is the refinement of the generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology theory K-theory to differential cohomology.
In as far as we can think of cocycles in K-theory as represented by vector bundles or vectorial bundles, cocycles in differential K-theory may be represented by vector bundles with connection.
There are various different models that differ in the concrete realization of these cocycles and in their extra properties.
Differential cobordism cohomology is the refinement to differential cohomology of cobordism cohomology theory.
By tensoring with a Landweber exact ring, this induces various other differential cohomology theories, such as differential elliptic cohomology.

level (Chern-Simons theory)

A connection on a bundle ∇\nabla for π:P→X\pi : P \to X a GG-principal bundle encodes data that assigns to each path γ:[0,1]→X\gamma : [0,1] \to X a homomorphism
tra ∇(γ):P γ(0)→P γ(1)
  tra_\nabla(\gamma) : P_{\gamma(0)} \to P_{\gamma(1)}


between the fibers of the bundle, such that this assignment depends well (e.g. smoothly) on the choice of path and is compatible with composition of paths.
This assignment is called the parallel transport of the connection.
The idea of parallelism
The term “parallel” comes from one of the many equivalent definitions of the notion of connection on a bundle: the original formulation of Ehresmann connections.
In that formulation, the connection is encoded at each point p∈Pp \in P in the total space by a decomposition of the tangent space T pPT_p P as a direct sum T pP≃V p⊕H pT_p P \simeq V_p \oplus H_p of vector spaces, such that


V p=kerπ *| pV_p = \ker \pi_*|_p is the kernel of the projection map that sends vectors in the total space to vectors in base space (this part is fixed by the choice of p:P→Xp : P \to X);


H p⊂T pPH_p \subset T_p P is a choice of complement, such that this choice varies smoothly over PP in an evident sense and is compatible with the GG-action on PP.


The vectors in V pV_p are called vertical , the vectors in H pH_p are called horizontal . One may think of this as defining locally in which way the base space sits horizontally in the total space, equivalently as identifying locally a “smoothly varying local trivialization” of PP.
More precisely, given such a choice of horizontal subspaces, there is for every path γ:[0,1]→X\gamma : [0,1] \to X and every choice of lift γ^(0)∈P\hat \gamma(0) \in P of the start point γ(0)\gamma(0) to the total space of the bundle, a unique lift γ^:[0,1]→P\hat \gamma : [0,1] \to P of the entire path to the total space:
γ^(0) →γ^ γ^(1)  ∈ P      ↓ π γ(0) →γ γ(1)  ∈ X
  \array{
     \hat \gamma(0) &\stackrel{\hat \gamma}{\to}& \hat \gamma(1)
     && \in & P
     \\
     && &&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\pi}}
     \\
     \gamma(0) &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& \gamma(1) 
     && \in & X
  }
  \,


such that γ^\hat \gamma is everywhere parallel (to XX) in that all its tangent vectors sit in the horizontal subspaces chosen:
(∂ σγ^)(σ)∈H γ(σ)⊂T γ(σ)P.
  (\partial_\sigma \hat \gamma)(\sigma) \in H_{\gamma(\sigma)} \subset T_{\gamma(\sigma)} P
  \,.


In other words, this means that given a path γ\gamma down in XX, we may transport any point p∈P γ(0)p \in P_{\gamma(0)} above its start point parallely (with respect to the notion of parallelism determined by ∇\nabla) along γ\gamma, to find a uniquely determined point tra ∇(γ)(p)∈P γ(1)tra_\nabla(\gamma)(p) \in P_{\gamma(1)} over the endpoint.
The category-theoretic perspective
The parallel transport-assignment of fiber-homomorphisms to paths
(x→γy)↦(P x→tra ∇(γ)y)
  (x \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} y) \mapsto ( P_x \stackrel{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}{\to} y ) 


enjoys the following properties:


it is invariant under thin homotopy of paths;


it is compatible with composition of paths and sends constant paths to identity homomorphisms;


it sends smooth families of paths to compatible smooth families of homomorphisms.


This may be equivalently but more succinctly be formulated as follows:
We say diffeological groupoid for an internal groupoid in the category of diffeological spaces.
The smooth paths in a smooth manifold XX naturally form the diffeological groupoid called the path groupoid P 1(X)P_1(X). Objects are points in XX, morphsims are thin homotopy-classes of smooth paths which are constant in a neighbourhood of their boundary, composition is concatenation of paths.
For P→XP \to X any GG-bundle, there is also naturally the diffeological groupoid At(P)At(P) – the Atiyah Lie groupoid of PP. Objects are points in XX, morphisms are homomorphisms of GG-torsors between the fibers over these points.
Then the above properties of parallel transport are equivalent to saying that we have an internal functor
tra:P 1(X)→At(P)
  tra : P_1(X) \to At(P)


that is the identity on objects. Moreover, this functor uniquely characterizes the connection on PP that it comes from. This means that we may identify connections on PP with their parallel transport functors.
But even the bundle PP itself is encoded in such functors. If instead of looking at the category of internal groupoids and internal functors, we look at the larger 2-topos of diffeological stacks – stacks over CartSp.
Then we can take simply the diffeological delooping groupoid BG\mathbf{B}G, which has a single object and GG as its hom-set and consider morphisms
tra:P 1(X)→BG
  tra : P_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


in the 2-topos. These are now given by anafunctors of internal groupoids, and one finds that they encode a Cech cocycle for a GG-principal bundle PP together with the parallel transport of a connection over it.
This is discussed in more detail at

∞-Chern-Weil theory – preparatory concepts.

There is also the diffeological groupoid incarnation of the fundamental groupoid Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X) of XX. Its morphisms are full homotopy-classes of paths. There is a canonical projection P 1(X)→Π 1(X)P_1(X) \to \Pi_1(X) that sends a thin-homotopy class of paths to the corresponding full-homotopy class.
A parallel transport functor tra:P 1(X)→Gtra : P_1(X) \to G factors through Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X) precisely if the corresponding connection is flat in that its curvature form vanishes.
In physics
In physics, a connection on a bundle over XX models a gauge field such as the electromagnetic field or more generally a Yang-Mills field or the field of gravity on a spacetime XX.
The forces exerted by such gauge fields on charged particles propagating on XX (i.e. electrons, quarks and generally massive particles, respectively) are encoded precisely in the parallel transport assignment of the gauge field connection to their trajectories.
More precisely, the exponentiated action functional for the electron propagating on XX in the presence of an electromagnetic field ∇\nabla is the functional on the space of paths in XX given by
γ↦exp(iS kin(γ))⋅tra ∇(γ),
  \gamma \mapsto \exp(i S_{kin}(\gamma)) \cdot tra_\nabla(\gamma)
  \,,


where the first term is the standard kinetic action. If ∇\nabla is a (nontrivial) connection on a trivial bundle, then, as described below it is encoded by a differential form A∈Ω 1(X)A \in \Omega^1(X) – called the vector potential in physics – and we have
tra ∇(γ)=exp(i∫ [0,1]γ *A).
  tra_\nabla(\gamma) = \exp\big(i \int_{[0,1]} \gamma^* A\big)
  \,.


The Euler-Lagrange equations induced by this functional express precisely the Lorentz force encoded by AA acting on the particle.
If instead of looking at the quantum mechanics of the quantum particle charged under a fixed background gauge field look at the quantum field theory of that gauge field itself, we can use the action functional of particles to probe these background fields and obtain quantum observables for them.
This converse assignment where we fix a path γ\gamma and regard the parallel transport then as a functional over the space of all connections over XX
tra (−)(γ):connections→fiber−homomorphisms
  tra_{(-)}(\gamma) : connections \to fiber-homomorphisms


is called the Wilson line-observable of the theory. Or rather its expectation value in the path integral weighted by the action functional of the gauge theory is called such, schematically:
W γ:=⟨tra (∇)(γ)⟩=∫D∇exp(iS gaugetheory(∇))tra ∇(γ).
  W_\gamma := \langle tra_{(\nabla)}(\gamma)\rangle
  = 
  \int D \nabla \; \exp(i S_{gauge\;theory}(\nabla)) 
    tra_\nabla(\gamma)
  \,.


A connection on a bundle induces a notion of parallel transport over paths . A connection on a 2-bundle induces a generalization of this to a notion of parallel transport over surfaces . Similarly a connection on a 3-bundle induces a notion of parallel transport over 3-dimensional volumes.
Generally, a connection on an ∞-bundle induces a notion of parallel transport in arbitrary dimension.
The higher notions of differential cohomology and Chern-Weil theory make sense in any cohesive (∞,1)-topos
(Π⊣Disc⊣Γ):H→Γ←Disc→Π∞Grpd≃Top.
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma) : 
   \mathbf{H} 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd \simeq Top
  \,.


In every such there is a notion of connection on an ∞-bundle and of its higher parallel transport.
A typical context considered (more or less explicitly) in the literature is H=\mathbf{H} =  Smooth∞Grpd, the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids. But other choices are possible. (See also the Examples.)
Higher parallel transport
Let AA be an ∞-Lie groupoid such that morphisms X→AX \to A in Smooth∞Grpd classify the AA-principal ∞-bundles under consideration. Write A connA_{conn} for the differential refinement described at ∞-Lie algebra valued form, such that lifts
  A conn   ∇↗ ↓ X →g A
  \array{
     && A_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& A
  }


describe connections on ∞-bundles.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} say that ∇\nabla admits parallel nn-transport if for all smooth manifolds Σ\Sigma of dimension nn and all morphisms
ϕ:Σ→X
  \phi : \Sigma \to X


we have that the pullback of ∇\nabla to Σ\Sigma
ϕ *∇:Σ→ϕX→∇A conn
  \phi^* \nabla : \Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} X \stackrel{\nabla}{\to} A_{conn}


flat in that it factors through the canonical inclusion ♭A→A conn\mathbf{\flat}A \to A_{conn}.
In other words: if all the lower curvature kk-forms, 1≤k≤n1 \leq k \leq n of ϕ *∇\phi^* \nabla vanish (the higher ones vanish automatically for dimensional reasons).

Here ♭A=[Π(−),A]\mathbf{\flat}A = [\mathbf{\Pi}(-),A] is the coefficient for flat differential A-cohomology.

Remark
This condition is automatically satisfied for ordinary connections on bundles, hence for A=BGA = \mathbf{B}G with GG an ordinary Lie group: because in that case there is only a single curvature form, namely the ordinary curvature 2-form.
But for a principal 2-bundle with connection there is in general a 2-form curvature and a 3-form curvature. A 2-connection therefore admits parallel transport only if its 2-form curvature is constrained to vanish.
Notice however that if the coefficient object AA happens to be (n−1)(n-1)-connected – for instance if it is an Eilenberg-MacLane object in degree nn, then there is no extra condition and every connection admits parallel transport. This is notably the case for circle n-bundles with connection.


Definition
For ∇:X→A conn\nabla : X \to A_{conn} an ∞\infty-connection that admits parallel nn-transport, this is for each ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X the morphism
Π(Σ)→A
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to A


that corresponds to ϕ *∇\phi^* \nabla under the equivalence
H(Σ,♭A)≃H(Π(Σ),A).
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, \mathbf{\flat}A ) \simeq \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma), A)
  \,.



Remark
The objects of the path ∞-groupoid Π(Σ)\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) are points in Σ\Sigma, the morphisms are paths in there, the 2-morphisms surfaces between these paths, and so on. Hence a morphism Π(Σ)→A\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to A assigns fibers in AA to points in XX, and equivalences between these fibers to paths in Σ\Sigma, and so on.

Higher holonomy
We now define the higher analogs of holonomy for the case that Σ\Sigma is closed.

Definition
Let ∇:X→A conn\nabla : X \to A_{conn} be a connection with parallel nn-transport and ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X a morphism from a closed nn-manifold.
Then the nn-holonomy of ∇\nabla over Σ\Sigma is the image [ϕ *∇][\phi^* \nabla] of
ϕ *∇:Π(Σ)→Γ(A)
  \phi^* \nabla : \Pi(\Sigma) \to \Gamma(A)


in the homotopy category
[ϕ *∇]∈[Π(Σ),Γ(A)]
  [\phi^* \nabla] \in [\Pi(\Sigma), \Gamma(A)] 


For trivial circle nn-bundles / for nn-forms
The simplest example is the parallel transport in a circle n-bundle with connection over a smooth manifold XX whose underlying B n−1U(1)\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1)-bundle is trivial. This is equivalently given by a degree nn-differential form A∈Ω n(X)A \in \Omega^n(X). For ϕ:Σ n→X\phi : \Sigma_n \to X any smooth function from an nn-dimensional manifold Σ\Sigma, the corresponding parallel transport is simply the integral of AA over Σ\Sigma:
tra A(Σ)=exp(i∫ Σϕ *A)∈U(1).
  \tra_A(\Sigma) = \exp(i \int_\Sigma \phi^* A)
  \;\;\; \in \;\; U(1)
  \,.


One can understand higher parallel transport therefore as a generalization of integration of differential nn-forms to the case where


the nn-form is not globally defined;


the nn-form takes values not in ℝ\mathbb{R} but more generally is an ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential form.


For circle nn-bundles with connection
We show how the nn-holonomy of circle n-bundles with connection is reproduced from the above.
Let ϕ *∇:Π(Σ)→B nU(1)\phi^* \nabla : \mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) be the parallel transport for a circle n-bundle with connection over a ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X.
This is equivalent to a morphism
Π(Σ)→ℬ nU(1),.
  \Pi(\Sigma) \to \mathcal{B}^n U(1)
  ,.


We may map this further to its (n−dimΣ)(n-dim \Sigma)-truncation
:∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))→τ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(X),ℬ nU(1)).
  :\infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), \mathcal{B}^n U(1)) 
  \to
  \tau_{n-dim \Sigma} \infty Grpd(\Pi(X), \mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \,.



Theorem
We have
τ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃B n−dimΣU(1).
  \tau_{n-dim\Sigma} \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), \mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \simeq
  \mathbf{B}^{n-dim \Sigma} U(1)
  \,.


(This is due to an observation by Domenico Fiorenza.)

Proof
By general abstract reasoning (recalled at cohomology and fiber sequence) we have for the homotopy groups that
π i∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃H n−i(Σ,U(1)).
  \pi_i \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \simeq 
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma, U(1))
  \,.


Now use the universal coefficient theorem, which asserts that we have an exact sequence
0→Ext 1(H n−i−1(Σ,ℤ),U(1))→H n−i(Σ,U(1))→Hom(H n−i(Σ,ℤ),U(1))→0.
  0
  \to 
  Ext^1(H_{n-i-1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))
  \to 
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma,U(1))
  \to 
  Hom(H_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))
  \to 0
  \,.


Since U(1)U(1) is an injective ℤ\mathbb{Z}-module we have
Ext 1(−,U(1))=0.
  Ext^1(-,U(1))=0
  \,.


This means that we have an isomorphism
H n−i(Σ,U(1))≃Hom Ab(H n−i(Σ,ℤ),U(1))
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma,U(1))
  \simeq 
  Hom_{Ab}(H_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))


that identifies the cohomology group in question with the internal hom in Ab from the integral homology group of Σ\Sigma to U(1)U(1).
For i<(n−dimΣ)i\lt (n-dim \Sigma), the right hand is zero, so that
π i∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))=0fori<(n−dimΣ).
  \pi_i \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathbf{B}^n U(1)) =0 \;\;\;\;
  for i\lt (n-dim \Sigma)
  \,. 


For i=(n−dimΣ)i=(n-dim \Sigma), instead, H n−i(Σ,ℤ)≃ℤH_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Z}, since Σ\Sigma is a closed dimΣdim \Sigma-manifold and so
π (n−dimΣ)∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃U(1).
  \pi_{(n-dim\Sigma)} \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathcal{B}^n U(1))\simeq U(1)
  \,.



Definition
The resulting morphism
H(Σ,A conn)→exp(iS(−))B n−dimΣU(1)
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, A_{conn})
  \stackrel{\exp(i S(-))}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n-dim\Sigma} U(1)


in ∞Grpd we call the ∞\infty-Chern-Simons action on Σ\Sigma.

Here in the language of quantum field theory


the objects of H(Σ,A conn)\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,A_{conn}) are the gauge field on Σ\Sigma;


the morphisms in H(Σ,A conn)\mathbf{H}(\Sigma, A_{conn}) are the gauge transformations;.


Nonabelian parallel transport in low dimension
At least in low categorical dimension one has the definition of the path n-groupoid P n(X)\mathbf{P}_n(X) of a smooth manifold, whose nn-morphisms are thin homotopy-classes of smooth functions [0,1] n→X[0,1]^n \to X. Parallel nn-transport with only the (n+1)(n+1)-curvature form possibly nontrivial and all the lower curvature degree 1- to nn-forms nontrivial may be expressed in terms of smooth nn-functors out of P n\mathbf{P}_n (SWI, SWII, MartinsPickenI, MartinsPickenII).
1-Transport
See parallel transport.
2-Transport
We work now concretely in the category 2DiffeoGrpd2DiffeoGrpd of 2-groupoids internal to the category of diffeological spaces.
Let XX be a smooth manifold and write P 2(X)∈2DiffeoGrpd\mathbf{P}_2(X) \in 2DiffeoGrpd for its path 2-groupoid. Let GG be a Lie 2-group and BG∈2DiffeoGrpd\mathbf{B}G \in 2DiffeoGrpd its delooping 1-object 2-groupoid. Write 𝔤\mathfrak{g} for the corresponding Lie 2-algebra.
Assume now first that GG is a strict 2-group given by a crossed module (G 1→G 0)(G_1 \to G_0). Corresponding to this is a differential crossed module (𝔤 1→𝔤 0)(\mathfrak{g}_1 \to \mathfrak{g}_0).
We describe now how smooth 2-functors
tra:P 2(X)→BG
  tra : \mathbf{P}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


i.e. morphisms in 2DiffeoGrpd2DiffeoGrpd are characterized by Lie 2-algebra valued differential forms on XX.

Definition
Given a morphism F:P 2(X)→BGF : \mathbf{P}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B}G we construct a 𝔤 1\mathfrak{g}_1-valued 2-form B F∈Ω 2(X,𝔤 1)B_F \in \Omega^2(X, \mathfrak{g}_1) as follows.
To find the value of B FB_F on two vectors v 1,v 2∈T pXv_1, v_2 \in T_p X at some point, choose any smooth function
Γ:ℝ 2→X
  \Gamma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to X


with


Γ(0,0)=p\Gamma(0,0) = p


dds| s=0Γ(s,0)=v 1\frac{d}{d s}|_{s = 0} \Gamma(s,0) = v_1


ddt| t=0Γ(0,t)=v 2\frac{d}{d t}|_{t = 0} \Gamma(0,t) = v_2.


Notice that there is a canonical 2-parameter family
Σ ℝ:ℝ 2→2MorP 2(ℝ 2)
  \Sigma_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to 2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)


of classes of bigons on the plane, given by sending (s,t)∈ℝ 2(s,t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 to the class represented by any bigon (with sitting instants) with straight edges filling the square
Σ ℝ(s,t)=((0,0) → (0,t) ↓  ↓ (s,0) → (s,t)).
  \Sigma_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = 
  \left(
    \array{
      (0,0) &\to& (0,t)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      (s,0) &\to& (s,t)
    }
  \right)
  \,.


Using this we obtain a smooth function
F Γ:ℝ 2→Σ ℝ2MorP 2(ℝ 2)→Γ *2MorP 2(X)→FG 0×G 1→p 2G 1.
  F_\Gamma : 
  \mathbb{R}^2 \stackrel{\Sigma_{\mathbb{R}}}{\to}
  2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)
  \stackrel{\Gamma_*}{\to}
  2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(X)
  \stackrel{F}{\to}
  G_0 \times G_1
  \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
  G_1
  \,.


Then set
B F(v 1,w 1):=∂ 2F Γ∂x∂y| (0,0).
  B_F(v_1, w_1) := 
   \frac{\partial^2 F_\Gamma}{\partial x \partial y}|_{(0,0)}
  \,.



Proposition
This is well defined, in that B F(v 1,v 2)B_F(v_1,v_2) does not depend on the choices made. Moreover, the 2-form defines this way is smooth.


Proof
To see that the definition does not depend on the choice of Γ\Gamma, proceed as follows.
For given vectors v 1,v 2∈T XXv_1,v_2 \in \T_X X let Γ,Γ′:ℝ 2→X\Gamma, \Gamma' : \mathbb{R}^2 \to X be two choices of smooth maps as in the defnition. By restricting, if necessary, to a neighbourhood of the origin of ℝ 2\mathbb{R}^2, we may assume without restriction that these maps land in a single coordinate patch in XX. Using the vector space structure of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n defined by such a patch, define a smooth homotopy
τ:[0,1] 3→X:(x,y,z)↦(1−z)Γ(x,y)+zΓ′(x,y)
  \tau : [0,1]^3 \to X : (x,y,z) \mapsto (1-z)\Gamma(x,y) + z \Gamma'(x,y)


Let
Z={(x,y,w)∈[0,1] 3|0≤w≤12(x 2+y 2)}
  Z = \{(x,y,w) \in [0,1]^3 | 0 \leq w \leq \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) \}


and consider the map f:[0,1] 3→Zf : [0,1]^3 \to Z given by
f:(x,y,z)↦(x,y,12(x 2+y 2)z)
  f : (x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y, \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) z)


and the map g:Z→Xg : Z \to X given away from (x 2+y 2)=0(x^2 + y^2) = 0 by
g:(x,y,w)↦τ(x,y,2wx 2+y 2).
  g : (x,y,w) \mapsto \tau(x,y, 2 \frac{w}{x^2 + y^2})
  \,.


Using Hadamard's lemma and the fact that by constructon τ\tau has vanishing 0th and 1st order differentials at the origin it follows that this is indeed a smooth function.
We want to similarly factor the smooth family of bigons [0,1] 3→2Mor(P 2(X))[0,1]^3 \to 2Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X)) given by
[0,1] 3×[0,1] 2→X
  [0,1]^3 \times [0,1]^2 \to X

((x,y,z),(s,t))↦τ(sx,ty,z)
  ((x,y,z),(s,t)) \mapsto \tau(s x, t y, z)


as [0,1] 3×[0,1] 2→Z×[0,1] 2→Z→X[0,1]^3 \times [0,1]^2 \to Z \times [0,1]^2 \to Z \to X
((x,y,z),(s,t))↦((x,y,12(x 2+y 2)),(s,t))↦(sx,ty,12((sx) 2+(ty) 2)z)↦τ(sx,sy,z).
  ((x,y,z),(s,t)) 
    \mapsto
  ((x, y, \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)), (s,t))
    \mapsto
  (s x , t y, \frac{1}{2}((s x)^2 + (t y)^2)z)
    \mapsto

  \tau(s x, s y, z)
  \,.


As before using Hadamard’s lemma this is a sequence of smooth functions. To make this qualify as a family of bigons (which are maps from the square that are constant in a neighbourhood of the left and right boundary of the square) furthermore precompose this with a suitable smooth function [0,1] 2→[0,1] 2[0,1]^2 \to [0,1]^2 that realizes a square-shaped bigon.
Under the hom-adjunction it corresponds to a factorization of G Γ:[0,1] 3→2Mor(P 2(X))G_\Gamma : [0,1]^3 \to 2 Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X)) into
G Γ:[0,1] 3→fZ→2Mor(P 2(X)).
 G_\Gamma :  [0,1]^3 \stackrel{f}{\to} Z \to 2 Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X))
  \,.


By the above construction we have the the push-forwards
f *:∂∂x(x=0,y=0,z)↦∂∂x(x=0,y=0,w=0)
  f_* : \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x=0,y=0,z)  
    \mapsto
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x= 0, y = 0, w = 0)


and similarly for ∂∂y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} are indendent of zz. It follows by the chain rule that also
∂ 2G Γ∂x∂y| (x=0,y=0)
  \frac{\partial^2 G_\Gamma}{\partial x \partial y}|_{(x=0,y=0)} 


is independent of zz. But at z=0z = 0 this equals ∂ 2F Γ∂x∂y| (x=0,y=0)\frac{\partial^2 F_\Gamma}{\partial x \partial y}|_{(x=0,y=0)}, while at z=1z = 1 it equals ∂ 2F Γ′∂x∂y| (x=0,y=0)\frac{\partial^2 F_{\Gamma'}}{\partial x \partial y}|_{(x=0,y=0)}. Therefore these two are equal.

Flat ∞\infty-parallel transport in TopTop
Even though it is a degenerate case, it can be useful to regard the (∞,1)-topos Top explicitly a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. For a discussion of this see discrete ∞-groupoid.
For H=\mathbf{H} =  Top lots of structure of cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos theory degenerates, since by the homotopy hypothesis-theorem here the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(Π⊣Δ⊣Γ):Top→Γ←Δ←Π∈∞Grpd
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : Top 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}} \in
 \infty Grpd


an equivalence. The abstract fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos Π\Pi is here the ordinary fundamental ∞-groupoid
Π:Top→≃∞Grpd.
   \Pi : Top \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \infty Grpd
  \,.


If both (∞,1)-toposes here are presented by their standard model category models, the standard model structure on simplicial sets and the standard model structure on topological spaces, then Π\Pi is presented by the singular simplicial complex functor in a Quillen equivalence
(|−|⊣Sing):Top→≃ Quillen←Top.  
  (|-| \dashv Sing) : Top \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\overset{\simeq_{Quillen}}{\to}}
  Top
  \,.


This means that in this case many constructions in topology and classical homotopy theory have equivalent reformulations in terms of ∞\infty-parallel transport.
For instance: for F∈TopF \in Top and Aut(F)∈TopAut(F) \in Top its automorphism ∞-group, FF-fibrations over a base space X∈TopX \in Top are classfied by morphisms
g:X→BAut(F)
  g : X \to B Aut(F)


into the delooping of Aut(F)Aut(F). The corresponding fibration P→XP \to X itself is the homotopy fiber of this cocycles, given by the homotopy pullback
P → * ↓  ↓ X →g BAut(F)
  \array{
     P &\to& * 
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}&  B Aut(F)
  }


in Top, as described at principal ∞-bundle.
Using the fundamental ∞-groupoid functor we may send this equivalently to a fiber sequence in ∞Grpd
Π(P)→Π(X)→BAut(Π(F)).
  \Pi(P) \to \Pi(X) \to B Aut(\Pi(F))
  \,.


One may think of the morphism Π(X)→BAut(Π(F))\Pi(X) \to B Aut(\Pi(F)) now as the ∞\infty-parallel transport coresponding to the original fibration:


to each point in XX it assigns the unique object of BAut(Π(F))B Aut(\Pi(F)), which is the fiber FF itself;


to each path (x→y)(x \to y) in XX it assigns an equivalence between the fibers F xtoF yF_x to F_y etc.


If one presents Π\Pi by Sing:Top→sSet QuillenSing : Top \to sSet_{Quillen} as above, then one may look for explicit simplicial formulas that express these morphisms. Such are discussed in Stasheff.
We may embed this example into the smooth context by regarding Aut(F)Aut(F) as a discrete ∞-Lie groupoid as discussed in the section Flat ∞-Parallel transport in Smooth∞Grpd.
For that purpose let
(Π smooth⊣Disc smooth⊣Γ smooth):∞LieGrpd→Γ smooth←Disc smooth→Π smooth∞Grpd≃Top
  (\Pi_{smooth} \dashv Disc_{smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{smooth}) : 
   \infty LieGrpd
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{smooth}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{smooth}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{smooth}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd \simeq Top


be the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd.
We may reflect the ∞-group Aut(F)Aut(F) into this using the constant ∞-stack-functor DiscDisc to get the discrete ∞-Lie group DiscAut(F)Disc Aut(F). Let then XX be a paracompact smooth manifold, regarded naturally as an object of Smooth∞Grpd. Then we can consider cocycles/classifying morphisms
X→BDiscAut(F),
  X \to \mathbf{B} Disc Aut(F)
  \,,


now in the smooth context of ∞LieGrpd\infty LieGrpd.

Proposition
The ∞-groupoid of FF-fibrations in Top is equivalent to the ∞\infty-groupoid of DiscAut(F)Disc Aut(F)-principal ∞-bundles in Smooth∞Grpd:
∞LieGrpd(X,BDiscAut(F))≃Top(X,BAut(F)).
  \infty LieGrpd(X, \mathbf{B} Disc Aut(F))
  \simeq
  Top(X, B Aut(F))
  \,.


Moreover, all the principal ∞-bundles classified by the morphisms on the left have canonical extensions to Flat differential cohomology in ∞LieGrpd\infty LieGrpd, in that the flat parallel ∞\infty-transport ∇ flat\nabla_{flat} in
X →g BDiscAut(F) ↓ ↗ ∇ flat Π(X)
  \array{
    X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B} Disc Aut(F)
    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\nabla_{flat}}
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(X)
  }


always exists.


Proof
The first statement is a special case of that spelled out at Smooth∞Grpd and nonabelian cohomology. The second follows using that in a connected locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos the functor DiscDisc is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor.

∞\infty-Parallel transport from flat differential forms with values in chain complexes
A typical choice for an (∞,1)-category of “∞\infty-vector spaces” is that presented by the a model structure on chain complexes of modules. In a geometric context this may be replaced by some stack of complexes of vector bundles over some site.
If we write ModMod for this stack, then the ∞\infty-parallel transport for a flat ∞\infty-vector bundle on some XX is a morphism
Π(X)→Mod.
  \mathbf{\Pi}(X) \to Mod
  \,.


This is typically given by differential form data with values in ModMod.
A discussion of how to integrate flat differential forms with values in chain complexes – a representation of the tangent Lie algebroid as discussed at representations of ∞-Lie algebroids – to flat ∞\infty-parallel transport Π(X)→Mod\mathbf{\Pi}(X) \to Mod is in (AbadSchaetz), building on a construciton in (Igusa).
The refinement of the notion of fiber integration in generalized (Eilenberg-Steenrod) cohomology to differential cohomology.
General discussion of fiber integration for Hopkins-Singer coefficients is in (HopkinsSinger, section 4.10) and for integration over circle fibers in (Bunke-Nikolaus-Völkl 13, section 4.5).
In (Bunke-Schick 09) and precursors, existence of fiber integration in differential cohomology over circle fibers was formalized as a separate axiom (Bunke-Schick 09, def. 1.3).
Given connection on a bundle ∇\nabla over a space XX, its parallel transport around some loop γ:[0,1]→X\gamma : [0,1] \to X, γ(0)=γ(1)=x 0\gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = x_0 yields an element
hol ∇(γ)∈G
  hol_\nabla(\gamma) \in G


in the automorphism group of the fiber P x 0P_{x_0} of the bundle. This is the holonomy of ∇\nabla around γ\gamma.
Fixing a connection ∇\nabla and a point x∈Xx \in X the collection of all elements hol ∇(γ)hol_\nabla(\gamma) for all loops γ\gamma based at xx forms a subgroup of GG, called the holonomy group.
If the Levi-Civita connection on a Riemannian manifold (X,g)(X,g) has a holonomy group that is a proper subgroup of the special orthogonal group one says that (X,g)(X,g) is a manifold with special holonomy. (More precise would be: “with special holonomy group for the Levi-Civita connection”.)
Proposition. If on a smooth principal bundle P→XP\to X there is a connection ∇\nabla whose holonomy group is GG then the structure group can be reduced to GG.
(…)

Theorem
(Ambrose-Singer) Ambrose-Singer theorem: the Lie algebra of the holonomy group of a connection on a bundle ∇\nabla on XX at a point x∈Xx \in X is spanned by the parallel transport Ad tra ∇(γ)(F A(v∨w))Ad_{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}(F_A(v \vee w)) of the curvature F AF_A evaluated on any v∨w∈∧ 2T yXv \vee w \in \wedge^2 T_y X at y∈Xy \in X along any path γ\gamma from x→yx \to y.

We may think of Id+Ad tra ∇(γ)(F A(ϕ))Id + \Ad_{tra_\nabla(\gamma)}(F_A(\phi)) as being the holonomy around the loop obtained by


going along γ\gamma from xx to yy


going around the infinitesimal parallelogram spanned by vv and ww;


coming back to xx along the reverse path γ\gamma.


A connection on a bundle induces a notion of parallel transport over paths . A connection on a 2-bundle induces a generalization of this to a notion of parallel transport over surfaces . Similarly a connection on a 3-bundle induces a notion of parallel transport over 3-dimensional volumes.
Generally, a connection on an ∞-bundle induces a notion of parallel transport in arbitrary dimension.
The higher notions of differential cohomology and Chern-Weil theory make sense in any cohesive (∞,1)-topos
(Π⊣Disc⊣Γ):H→Γ←Disc→Π∞Grpd≃Top.
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma) : 
   \mathbf{H} 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd \simeq Top
  \,.


In every such there is a notion of connection on an ∞-bundle and of its higher parallel transport.
A typical context considered (more or less explicitly) in the literature is H=\mathbf{H} =  Smooth∞Grpd, the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids. But other choices are possible. (See also the Examples.)
Higher parallel transport
Let AA be an ∞-Lie groupoid such that morphisms X→AX \to A in Smooth∞Grpd classify the AA-principal ∞-bundles under consideration. Write A connA_{conn} for the differential refinement described at ∞-Lie algebra valued form, such that lifts
  A conn   ∇↗ ↓ X →g A
  \array{
     && A_{conn}
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\nabla}}\nearrow & \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& A
  }


describe connections on ∞-bundles.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} say that ∇\nabla admits parallel nn-transport if for all smooth manifolds Σ\Sigma of dimension nn and all morphisms
ϕ:Σ→X
  \phi : \Sigma \to X


we have that the pullback of ∇\nabla to Σ\Sigma
ϕ *∇:Σ→ϕX→∇A conn
  \phi^* \nabla : \Sigma \stackrel{\phi}{\to} X \stackrel{\nabla}{\to} A_{conn}


flat in that it factors through the canonical inclusion ♭A→A conn\mathbf{\flat}A \to A_{conn}.
In other words: if all the lower curvature kk-forms, 1≤k≤n1 \leq k \leq n of ϕ *∇\phi^* \nabla vanish (the higher ones vanish automatically for dimensional reasons).

Here ♭A=[Π(−),A]\mathbf{\flat}A = [\mathbf{\Pi}(-),A] is the coefficient for flat differential A-cohomology.

Remark
This condition is automatically satisfied for ordinary connections on bundles, hence for A=BGA = \mathbf{B}G with GG an ordinary Lie group: because in that case there is only a single curvature form, namely the ordinary curvature 2-form.
But for a principal 2-bundle with connection there is in general a 2-form curvature and a 3-form curvature. A 2-connection therefore admits parallel transport only if its 2-form curvature is constrained to vanish.
Notice however that if the coefficient object AA happens to be (n−1)(n-1)-connected – for instance if it is an Eilenberg-MacLane object in degree nn, then there is no extra condition and every connection admits parallel transport. This is notably the case for circle n-bundles with connection.


Definition
For ∇:X→A conn\nabla : X \to A_{conn} an ∞\infty-connection that admits parallel nn-transport, this is for each ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X the morphism
Π(Σ)→A
  \mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to A


that corresponds to ϕ *∇\phi^* \nabla under the equivalence
H(Σ,♭A)≃H(Π(Σ),A).
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, \mathbf{\flat}A ) \simeq \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma), A)
  \,.



Remark
The objects of the path ∞-groupoid Π(Σ)\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) are points in Σ\Sigma, the morphisms are paths in there, the 2-morphisms surfaces between these paths, and so on. Hence a morphism Π(Σ)→A\mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to A assigns fibers in AA to points in XX, and equivalences between these fibers to paths in Σ\Sigma, and so on.

Higher holonomy
We now define the higher analogs of holonomy for the case that Σ\Sigma is closed.

Definition
Let ∇:X→A conn\nabla : X \to A_{conn} be a connection with parallel nn-transport and ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X a morphism from a closed nn-manifold.
Then the nn-holonomy of ∇\nabla over Σ\Sigma is the image [ϕ *∇][\phi^* \nabla] of
ϕ *∇:Π(Σ)→Γ(A)
  \phi^* \nabla : \Pi(\Sigma) \to \Gamma(A)


in the homotopy category
[ϕ *∇]∈[Π(Σ),Γ(A)]
  [\phi^* \nabla] \in [\Pi(\Sigma), \Gamma(A)] 


For trivial circle nn-bundles / for nn-forms
The simplest example is the parallel transport in a circle n-bundle with connection over a smooth manifold XX whose underlying B n−1U(1)\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1)-bundle is trivial. This is equivalently given by a degree nn-differential form A∈Ω n(X)A \in \Omega^n(X). For ϕ:Σ n→X\phi : \Sigma_n \to X any smooth function from an nn-dimensional manifold Σ\Sigma, the corresponding parallel transport is simply the integral of AA over Σ\Sigma:
tra A(Σ)=exp(i∫ Σϕ *A)∈U(1).
  \tra_A(\Sigma) = \exp(i \int_\Sigma \phi^* A)
  \;\;\; \in \;\; U(1)
  \,.


One can understand higher parallel transport therefore as a generalization of integration of differential nn-forms to the case where


the nn-form is not globally defined;


the nn-form takes values not in ℝ\mathbb{R} but more generally is an ∞-Lie algebroid valued differential form.


For circle nn-bundles with connection
We show how the nn-holonomy of circle n-bundles with connection is reproduced from the above.
Let ϕ *∇:Π(Σ)→B nU(1)\phi^* \nabla : \mathbf{\Pi}(\Sigma) \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) be the parallel transport for a circle n-bundle with connection over a ϕ:Σ→X\phi : \Sigma \to X.
This is equivalent to a morphism
Π(Σ)→ℬ nU(1),.
  \Pi(\Sigma) \to \mathcal{B}^n U(1)
  ,.


We may map this further to its (n−dimΣ)(n-dim \Sigma)-truncation
:∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))→τ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(X),ℬ nU(1)).
  :\infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), \mathcal{B}^n U(1)) 
  \to
  \tau_{n-dim \Sigma} \infty Grpd(\Pi(X), \mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \,.



Theorem
We have
τ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃B n−dimΣU(1).
  \tau_{n-dim\Sigma} \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), \mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \simeq
  \mathbf{B}^{n-dim \Sigma} U(1)
  \,.


(This is due to an observation by Domenico Fiorenza.)

Proof
By general abstract reasoning (recalled at cohomology and fiber sequence) we have for the homotopy groups that
π i∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃H n−i(Σ,U(1)).
  \pi_i \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathcal{B}^n U(1))
  \simeq 
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma, U(1))
  \,.


Now use the universal coefficient theorem, which asserts that we have an exact sequence
0→Ext 1(H n−i−1(Σ,ℤ),U(1))→H n−i(Σ,U(1))→Hom(H n−i(Σ,ℤ),U(1))→0.
  0
  \to 
  Ext^1(H_{n-i-1}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))
  \to 
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma,U(1))
  \to 
  Hom(H_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))
  \to 0
  \,.


Since U(1)U(1) is an injective ℤ\mathbb{Z}-module we have
Ext 1(−,U(1))=0.
  Ext^1(-,U(1))=0
  \,.


This means that we have an isomorphism
H n−i(Σ,U(1))≃Hom Ab(H n−i(Σ,ℤ),U(1))
  H^{n-i}(\Sigma,U(1))
  \simeq 
  Hom_{Ab}(H_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}),U(1))


that identifies the cohomology group in question with the internal hom in Ab from the integral homology group of Σ\Sigma to U(1)U(1).
For i<(n−dimΣ)i\lt (n-dim \Sigma), the right hand is zero, so that
π i∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))=0fori<(n−dimΣ).
  \pi_i \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathbf{B}^n U(1)) =0 \;\;\;\;
  for i\lt (n-dim \Sigma)
  \,. 


For i=(n−dimΣ)i=(n-dim \Sigma), instead, H n−i(Σ,ℤ)≃ℤH_{n-i}(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z})\simeq \mathbb{Z}, since Σ\Sigma is a closed dimΣdim \Sigma-manifold and so
π (n−dimΣ)∞Grpd(Π(Σ),ℬ nU(1))≃U(1).
  \pi_{(n-dim\Sigma)} \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma),\mathcal{B}^n U(1))\simeq U(1)
  \,.



Definition
The resulting morphism
H(Σ,A conn)→exp(iS(−))B n−dimΣU(1)
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, A_{conn})
  \stackrel{\exp(i S(-))}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n-dim\Sigma} U(1)


in ∞Grpd we call the ∞\infty-Chern-Simons action on Σ\Sigma.

Here in the language of quantum field theory


the objects of H(Σ,A conn)\mathbf{H}(\Sigma,A_{conn}) are the gauge field on Σ\Sigma;


the morphisms in H(Σ,A conn)\mathbf{H}(\Sigma, A_{conn}) are the gauge transformations;.


Nonabelian parallel transport in low dimension
At least in low categorical dimension one has the definition of the path n-groupoid P n(X)\mathbf{P}_n(X) of a smooth manifold, whose nn-morphisms are thin homotopy-classes of smooth functions [0,1] n→X[0,1]^n \to X. Parallel nn-transport with only the (n+1)(n+1)-curvature form possibly nontrivial and all the lower curvature degree 1- to nn-forms nontrivial may be expressed in terms of smooth nn-functors out of P n\mathbf{P}_n (SWI, SWII, MartinsPickenI, MartinsPickenII).
1-Transport
See parallel transport.
2-Transport
We work now concretely in the category 2DiffeoGrpd2DiffeoGrpd of 2-groupoids internal to the category of diffeological spaces.
Let XX be a smooth manifold and write P 2(X)∈2DiffeoGrpd\mathbf{P}_2(X) \in 2DiffeoGrpd for its path 2-groupoid. Let GG be a Lie 2-group and BG∈2DiffeoGrpd\mathbf{B}G \in 2DiffeoGrpd its delooping 1-object 2-groupoid. Write 𝔤\mathfrak{g} for the corresponding Lie 2-algebra.
Assume now first that GG is a strict 2-group given by a crossed module (G 1→G 0)(G_1 \to G_0). Corresponding to this is a differential crossed module (𝔤 1→𝔤 0)(\mathfrak{g}_1 \to \mathfrak{g}_0).
We describe now how smooth 2-functors
tra:P 2(X)→BG
  tra : \mathbf{P}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


i.e. morphisms in 2DiffeoGrpd2DiffeoGrpd are characterized by Lie 2-algebra valued differential forms on XX.

Definition
Given a morphism F:P 2(X)→BGF : \mathbf{P}_2(X) \to \mathbf{B}G we construct a 𝔤 1\mathfrak{g}_1-valued 2-form B F∈Ω 2(X,𝔤 1)B_F \in \Omega^2(X, \mathfrak{g}_1) as follows.
To find the value of B FB_F on two vectors v 1,v 2∈T pXv_1, v_2 \in T_p X at some point, choose any smooth function
Γ:ℝ 2→X
  \Gamma : \mathbb{R}^2 \to X


with


Γ(0,0)=p\Gamma(0,0) = p


dds| s=0Γ(s,0)=v 1\frac{d}{d s}|_{s = 0} \Gamma(s,0) = v_1


ddt| t=0Γ(0,t)=v 2\frac{d}{d t}|_{t = 0} \Gamma(0,t) = v_2.


Notice that there is a canonical 2-parameter family
Σ ℝ:ℝ 2→2MorP 2(ℝ 2)
  \Sigma_{\mathbb{R}} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to 2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)


of classes of bigons on the plane, given by sending (s,t)∈ℝ 2(s,t) \in \mathbb{R}^2 to the class represented by any bigon (with sitting instants) with straight edges filling the square
Σ ℝ(s,t)=((0,0) → (0,t) ↓  ↓ (s,0) → (s,t)).
  \Sigma_{\mathbb{R}}(s,t) = 
  \left(
    \array{
      (0,0) &\to& (0,t)
      \\
      \downarrow && \downarrow
      \\
      (s,0) &\to& (s,t)
    }
  \right)
  \,.


Using this we obtain a smooth function
F Γ:ℝ 2→Σ ℝ2MorP 2(ℝ 2)→Γ *2MorP 2(X)→FG 0×G 1→p 2G 1.
  F_\Gamma : 
  \mathbb{R}^2 \stackrel{\Sigma_{\mathbb{R}}}{\to}
  2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^2)
  \stackrel{\Gamma_*}{\to}
  2Mor \mathbf{P}_2(X)
  \stackrel{F}{\to}
  G_0 \times G_1
  \stackrel{p_2}{\to}
  G_1
  \,.


Then set
B F(v 1,w 1):=∂ 2F Γ∂x∂y| (0,0).
  B_F(v_1, w_1) := 
   \frac{\partial^2 F_\Gamma}{\partial x \partial y}|_{(0,0)}
  \,.



Proposition
This is well defined, in that B F(v 1,v 2)B_F(v_1,v_2) does not depend on the choices made. Moreover, the 2-form defines this way is smooth.


Proof
To see that the definition does not depend on the choice of Γ\Gamma, proceed as follows.
For given vectors v 1,v 2∈T XXv_1,v_2 \in \T_X X let Γ,Γ′:ℝ 2→X\Gamma, \Gamma' : \mathbb{R}^2 \to X be two choices of smooth maps as in the defnition. By restricting, if necessary, to a neighbourhood of the origin of ℝ 2\mathbb{R}^2, we may assume without restriction that these maps land in a single coordinate patch in XX. Using the vector space structure of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n defined by such a patch, define a smooth homotopy
τ:[0,1] 3→X:(x,y,z)↦(1−z)Γ(x,y)+zΓ′(x,y)
  \tau : [0,1]^3 \to X : (x,y,z) \mapsto (1-z)\Gamma(x,y) + z \Gamma'(x,y)


Let
Z={(x,y,w)∈[0,1] 3|0≤w≤12(x 2+y 2)}
  Z = \{(x,y,w) \in [0,1]^3 | 0 \leq w \leq \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) \}


and consider the map f:[0,1] 3→Zf : [0,1]^3 \to Z given by
f:(x,y,z)↦(x,y,12(x 2+y 2)z)
  f : (x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y, \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2) z)


and the map g:Z→Xg : Z \to X given away from (x 2+y 2)=0(x^2 + y^2) = 0 by
g:(x,y,w)↦τ(x,y,2wx 2+y 2).
  g : (x,y,w) \mapsto \tau(x,y, 2 \frac{w}{x^2 + y^2})
  \,.


Using Hadamard's lemma and the fact that by constructon τ\tau has vanishing 0th and 1st order differentials at the origin it follows that this is indeed a smooth function.
We want to similarly factor the smooth family of bigons [0,1] 3→2Mor(P 2(X))[0,1]^3 \to 2Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X)) given by
[0,1] 3×[0,1] 2→X
  [0,1]^3 \times [0,1]^2 \to X

((x,y,z),(s,t))↦τ(sx,ty,z)
  ((x,y,z),(s,t)) \mapsto \tau(s x, t y, z)


as [0,1] 3×[0,1] 2→Z×[0,1] 2→Z→X[0,1]^3 \times [0,1]^2 \to Z \times [0,1]^2 \to Z \to X
((x,y,z),(s,t))↦((x,y,12(x 2+y 2)),(s,t))↦(sx,ty,12((sx) 2+(ty) 2)z)↦τ(sx,sy,z).
  ((x,y,z),(s,t)) 
    \mapsto
  ((x, y, \frac{1}{2}(x^2 + y^2)), (s,t))
    \mapsto
  (s x , t y, \frac{1}{2}((s x)^2 + (t y)^2)z)
    \mapsto

  \tau(s x, s y, z)
  \,.


As before using Hadamard’s lemma this is a sequence of smooth functions. To make this qualify as a family of bigons (which are maps from the square that are constant in a neighbourhood of the left and right boundary of the square) furthermore precompose this with a suitable smooth function [0,1] 2→[0,1] 2[0,1]^2 \to [0,1]^2 that realizes a square-shaped bigon.
Under the hom-adjunction it corresponds to a factorization of G Γ:[0,1] 3→2Mor(P 2(X))G_\Gamma : [0,1]^3 \to 2 Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X)) into
G Γ:[0,1] 3→fZ→2Mor(P 2(X)).
 G_\Gamma :  [0,1]^3 \stackrel{f}{\to} Z \to 2 Mor(\mathbf{P}_2(X))
  \,.


By the above construction we have the the push-forwards
f *:∂∂x(x=0,y=0,z)↦∂∂x(x=0,y=0,w=0)
  f_* : \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x=0,y=0,z)  
    \mapsto
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x= 0, y = 0, w = 0)


and similarly for ∂∂y\frac{\partial}{\partial y} are indendent of zz. It follows by the chain rule that also

Flat ∞\infty-parallel transport in TopTop
Even though it is a degenerate case, it can be useful to regard the (∞,1)-topos Top explicitly a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. For a discussion of this see discrete ∞-groupoid.
For H=\mathbf{H} =  Top lots of structure of cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos theory degenerates, since by the homotopy hypothesis-theorem here the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(Π⊣Δ⊣Γ):Top→Γ←Δ←Π∈∞Grpd
  (\Pi \dashv \Delta \dashv \Gamma) : Top 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Delta}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}} \in
 \infty Grpd


an equivalence. The abstract fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos Π\Pi is here the ordinary fundamental ∞-groupoid
Π:Top→≃∞Grpd.
   \Pi : Top \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \infty Grpd
  \,.


If both (∞,1)-toposes here are presented by their standard model category models, the standard model structure on simplicial sets and the standard model structure on topological spaces, then Π\Pi is presented by the singular simplicial complex functor in a Quillen equivalence
(|−|⊣Sing):Top→≃ Quillen←Top.  
  (|-| \dashv Sing) : Top \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\overset{\simeq_{Quillen}}{\to}}
  Top
  \,.


This means that in this case many constructions in topology and classical homotopy theory have equivalent reformulations in terms of ∞\infty-parallel transport.
For instance: for F∈TopF \in Top and Aut(F)∈TopAut(F) \in Top its automorphism ∞-group, FF-fibrations over a base space X∈TopX \in Top are classfied by morphisms
g:X→BAut(F)
  g : X \to B Aut(F)


into the delooping of Aut(F)Aut(F). The corresponding fibration P→XP \to X itself is the homotopy fiber of this cocycles, given by the homotopy pullback
P → * ↓  ↓ X →g BAut(F)
  \array{
     P &\to& * 
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow
     \\
     X &\stackrel{g}{\to}&  B Aut(F)
  }


in Top, as described at principal ∞-bundle.
Using the fundamental ∞-groupoid functor we may send this equivalently to a fiber sequence in ∞Grpd
Π(P)→Π(X)→BAut(Π(F)).
  \Pi(P) \to \Pi(X) \to B Aut(\Pi(F))
  \,.


One may think of the morphism Π(X)→BAut(Π(F))\Pi(X) \to B Aut(\Pi(F)) now as the ∞\infty-parallel transport coresponding to the original fibration:


to each point in XX it assigns the unique object of BAut(Π(F))B Aut(\Pi(F)), which is the fiber FF itself;


to each path (x→y)(x \to y) in XX it assigns an equivalence between the fibers F xtoF yF_x to F_y etc.


If one presents Π\Pi by Sing:Top→sSet QuillenSing : Top \to sSet_{Quillen} as above, then one may look for explicit simplicial formulas that express these morphisms. Such are discussed in Stasheff.
We may embed this example into the smooth context by regarding Aut(F)Aut(F) as a discrete ∞-Lie groupoid as discussed in the section Flat ∞-Parallel transport in Smooth∞Grpd.
For that purpose let
(Π smooth⊣Disc smooth⊣Γ smooth):∞LieGrpd→Γ smooth←Disc smooth→Π smooth∞Grpd≃Top
  (\Pi_{smooth} \dashv Disc_{smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{smooth}) : 
   \infty LieGrpd
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{smooth}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{smooth}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{smooth}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd \simeq Top


be the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd.
We may reflect the ∞-group Aut(F)Aut(F) into this using the constant ∞-stack-functor DiscDisc to get the discrete ∞-Lie group DiscAut(F)Disc Aut(F). Let then XX be a paracompact smooth manifold, regarded naturally as an object of Smooth∞Grpd. Then we can consider cocycles/classifying morphisms
X→BDiscAut(F),
  X \to \mathbf{B} Disc Aut(F)
  \,,


now in the smooth context of ∞LieGrpd\infty LieGrpd.

Proposition
The ∞-groupoid of FF-fibrations in Top is equivalent to the ∞\infty-groupoid of DiscAut(F)Disc Aut(F)-principal ∞-bundles in Smooth∞Grpd:
∞LieGrpd(X,BDiscAut(F))≃Top(X,BAut(F)).
  \infty LieGrpd(X, \mathbf{B} Disc Aut(F))
  \simeq
  Top(X, B Aut(F))
  \,.


Moreover, all the principal ∞-bundles classified by the morphisms on the left have canonical extensions to Flat differential cohomology in ∞LieGrpd\infty LieGrpd, in that the flat parallel ∞\infty-transport ∇ flat\nabla_{flat} in
X →g BDiscAut(F) ↓ ↗ ∇ flat Π(X)
  \array{

    \\
    \downarrow & \nearrow_{\nabla_{flat}}
    \\
    \mathbf{\Pi}(X)
  }


always exists.


Proof
The first statement is a special case of that spelled out at Smooth∞Grpd and nonabelian cohomology. The second follows using that in a connected locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos the functor DiscDisc is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor.

∞\infty-Parallel transport from flat differential forms with values in chain complexes
A typical choice for an (∞,1)-category of “∞\infty-vector spaces” is that presented by the a model structure on chain complexes of modules. In a geometric context this may be replaced by some stack of complexes of vector bundles over some site.
If we write ModMod for this stack, then the ∞\infty-parallel transport for a flat ∞\infty-vector bundle on some XX is a morphism
Π(X)→Mod.
  \mathbf{\Pi}(X) \to Mod
  \,.


This is typically given by differential form data with values in ModMod.
A discussion of how to integrate flat differential forms with values in chain complexes – a representation of the tangent Lie algebroid as discussed at representations of ∞-Lie algebroids – to flat ∞\infty-parallel transport Π(X)→Mod\mathbf{\Pi}(X) \to Mod is in (AbadSchaetz), building on a construciton in (Igusa).
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
An ordinary gauge field (such as the electromagnetic field or the fields that induce the nuclear force) is a field (in the sense of physics) which is locally represented by a differential 1-form (the “gauge potential”) and whose field strength is locally a differential 2-form. For instance, in the case of the electromagnetic field this differential 2-form is the Faraday tensor.
Roughly speaking, a higher gauge field is similarly a field which is locally represented by differential forms of higher degree.
An explanation as to why an ordinary gauge field has a gauge potential given locally by a differential 1-form AA is that the trajectory of a charged particle is a 1-dimensional curve in spacetime XX, its worldline, hence a smooth function γ:Σ 1→X\gamma \colon \Sigma_1 \to X, and the canonical way to produce an action functional on the mapping space of such curves is the integration of 1-forms over curves:
exp(iℏS gauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ 1γ *A).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_1} \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \,.


This is the parallel transport map or the holonomy map, if Σ 1\Sigma_1 is a closed manifold. The contribution to the Euler-Lagrange equation of the particle obtained from the variation of this action functional is the Lorentz force which is exerted by the background gauge field on the particle.
When one generalizes in this picture from 0-dimensional particles with 1-dimensional worldlines to pp-dimensional particles (often called “p-branes”) with (p+1)(p+1)-dimensional worldvolumes γ p+1:Σ p+1→X\gamma_{p+1} \colon \Sigma_{p+1} \to X, then one needs, locally, a differential (p+1)-form A p+1A_{p+1} on spacetime XX
exp(iℏS highergauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ p+1γ p+1 *A p+1).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{higher\,gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_{p+1}} \gamma_{p+1}^\ast A_{p+1}
  \right)
  \,.


The field strength or flux of such a higher gauge field is, accordingly, locally the (p+2)(p+2)-form F p+2F_{p+2}.
The archetypical example of such a higher gauge field is the (hypothetical) Kalb-Ramond field or B-field (a precursor of the axion field under KK-compactification) to which the charged 1-brane, the “string”, couples. This is locally a differential 2-form B 2B_2, and the gauge-coupling term in the action functional for the string is accordingly, locally, of the form
exp(iℏS stringygauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ 2γ 2 *B 2).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{stringy\,gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_{2}} \gamma_2^\ast B_2
  \right)
  \,.


This continues: next one may consider “2-branes”, i.e. membranes, and these will couple to a 3-form gauge field. For instance, the membrane which gives the name to M-theory (the M2-brane) couples to a 3-form field called the supergravity C-field.
But there is an important further aspect to higher gauge fields which makes this simple picture of higher degree differential forms drastically more rich:
Where an ordinary gauge field has gauge transformations A 1↦A′ 1A_1 \mapsto A'_1 given locally by smooth functions (0-forms) λ 0\lambda_0 via the de Rham differential d dRd_{dR}
A′ 1=A 1+d dRλ 0
  A'_1 = A_1 + d_{dR} \lambda_0


so a higher gauge field has higher gauge transformations given locally by pp-forms λ p\lambda_p:
A′ p+1=A p+1+d dRλ p.
  A'_{p+1} = A_{p+1} + d_{dR} \lambda_{p}
  \,.


But for p≥0p \geq 0 then a crucial new effect appears: these gauge transformations, being higher differential forms themselves, have “gauge-of-gauge transformations” between them, given by lower degree forms.
This phenomenon implies that higher gauge fields have a rich global (“topological”) structure, witnessed by the higher analog of their instanton sectors. Namely, while a higher gauge field to which a p-brane may couple is locally given by a (p+1)(p+1)-form A p+1A_{p+1}, as one moves across coordinate charts this form gauge transforms by a pp-form, which then itself, as one passes along two charts, transforms by a (p−1)(p-1)-form, and so on.
The global structure for higher gauge fields obtained by carrying out this globalization via higher gauge transformations is the higher analog of that of a fiber bundle with connection on a bundle in higher differential geometry. This is sometimes known as a gerbe or, more generally, a principal infinity-bundle.
In fact the situation that there is just one gauge potential of degree (p+1)(p+1) with field strength of degree (p+2)(p+2) is just the simplest case, the “ordinary” case. More abstractly one says that such higher gauge fields are cocycles in ordinary differential cohomology.
More generally it may happen in higher gauge theory that the gauge potential is a formal linear combination of differential forms in various degrees.
The canonical example of this phenomenon is the RR-field in string theory. This has, locally, a gauge potential which is a differential form in every even degree, or every odd degree. If one is careful about the higher gauge transformations in this situation to find the correct global structure (the “instanton sector”) of the higher gauge field, then one finds that this now is a cocycle in a differential generalized cohomology, namely, in what is called differential topological K-theory. This may be understood as a higher and generalized form of the famous Dirac charge quantization condition for the electromagnetic field, see Freed 00. A lot of the fine detail of the anomaly cancellation in type II string theory depends on being careful about the global nature of this K-theoretic higher gauge RR-field (Distler-Freed-Moore 09)
A Wilson loop or Wilson line is an observable in (both classical and quantum) gauge theory obtained from the holonomy of the gauge connection.
Hence if the gauge connection is given by a globally defined 1-form AA, then the Wilson loop along a closed loop CC is the trace of the path-ordered exponential
W C=Tr(𝒫exp(i∮ CA μdx μ))
  W_C = Tr(\mathcal{P}exp(i\oint_C A_\mu d x^\mu))


where 𝒫\mathcal{P} is the “path-ordering operator” and A μA_\mu are the components of the connection.
Relation to 1d Chern-Simons theory
For GG a suitable Lie group (compact, semi-simple and simply connected) the Wilson loops of GG-principal connections are equivalently the partition functions of a 1-dimensional Chern-Simons theory.
This appears famously in the formulation of Chern-Simons theory with Wilson lines. More detailes are at orbit method.
As the universal Vassiliev invariant
The un-traced Wilson loop observable of perturbative Chern-Simons theory is the universal Vassiliev invariant (see there for more):







from Sati-Schreiber 19c

Relation to defects
Wilson loop insertions may be thought of or at least related to defects in the sense of QFT with defects.
Duality with ‘t Hooft operators under S-duality and geometric Langlands
S-duality of 4d super Yang-Mills theory may exchange Wilson loop operators with 't Hooft operators, in an incarnation of the geometric Langlands correspondence (Kapustin-Witten 06)

(Kapustin-Witten 06)
In physics the term Wilson loop refers to an observable in gauge field theory given by the holonomy of the given gauge field connection along a fixed curve.
In higher gauge theory one correspondingly has observables given by higher holonomy around higher dimensional manifolds, such as surfaces etc. These are hence sometimes called “Wilson surfaces” etc.
Cartan geometry is geometry of spaces that are locally (infinitesimally, tangentially) like coset spaces G/HG/H, i.e. like Klein geometries. Intuitively, Cartan geometry studies the geometry of a manifold by ‘rolling without sliding’ the ‘model geometry’ G/HG/H along it. Hence Cartan geometry may be thought of as the globalization of the program of Klein geometry initiated in the Erlangen program.
Cartan geometry subsumes many types of geometry, such as notably Riemannian geometry, conformal geometry, parabolic geometry and many more. As a Cartan geometry is defined by principal connection data (hence by cocycles in nonabelian differential cohomology) this means that it serves to express all these kinds of geometries in connection data.
This is used notably in the first order formulation of gravity, which was the motivating example in the original text (Cartan 22). The physics literature tends to use the term “Cartan moving frame method” instead of “Cartan geometry”.
A Cartan geometry is a space equipped with a Cartan connection. See there for more.

While Cartan geometry was originally conceived of in the context of differential geometry, its principles and constructions make sense much more generally. In particular they make sense in the context of supergeometry. The implementation of Cartan geometry in supergeometry may well be called super-Cartan geometry or Cartan super-geometry. Where the original and motivating example for plain Cartan geometry was the formulation of Einstein gravity (via pseudo-Riemannian geometry), so super-Cartan geometry underlies and finds motivation from the formulation of supergravity, see also the Survey of (non-)existing literature below.
While the abstract general theory of super-Cartan geometry proceeds in direct analogy with that of traditional Cartan geometry, the concrete particular examples tend to exhibit a richer behaviour. Specifically for the case relevant to supergravity this is due to two facts:


The super Euclidean spaces and super-Minkowski spacetimes, have, as super-translation groups, non-abelian supergroup structure, which is reflected in the fact that the left-invariant 1-forms (super differential forms) on these spaces are not closed. This means that they carry natural intrinsic torsion of a G-structure. Due to this fact the super-Cartan geometry involved in supergravity is richer than its bosonic counterpart in a way that goes beyond the addition of “superpartners”. For more on this see also at torsion constraints of supergravity.


In particular super-Minkowski spacetimes carry non-trivial exceptional super Lie algebra cocycles. Their globalization as definite forms is hence analogous to what is known in the bosonic case for instance for G2-structure. These globalizations play a key role in the discussion of super p-brane sigma-models on curved supergravity backgrounds. Moreover, these cocycles classify super L-infinity algebra extensions of super Minkowski spacetime known as extended super Minkowski spacetimes. This is the origin of much of higher Cartan geometry within super-Cartan geometry.


Higher Cartan geometry is supposed to be the generalization of Cartan geometry to higher geometry; hence the theory of geometric homotopy types (manifolds, orbifolds, Lie groupoids, geometric stacks, smooth groupoids, smooth infinity-groupoids, …) which are locally modeled on homotopy quotients G/HG/H of geometric infinity-groups – the globalized version of higher Klein geometry (see also the survey table below).
More in detail, this means that given a morphism H→GH \to G of suitably geometric ∞-groups then a higher Cartan geometry modeled on the homotopy quotient G/HG/H is a higher geometric space XX such as an orbifold, geometric ∞-stack, derived scheme etc. which, in some suitable sense, has its tangent spaces identified with an infinitesimal neighbourhood in G/HG/H.
Just like traditional Cartan geometry (in particular in the guise of G-structures) captures a plethora of relevant kinds of geometries ((pseudo-)Riemannian geometry (Cartan 23), conformal geometry, … complex geometry, symplectic geometry, …, parabolic geometry) so higher Cartan geometry is supposed to similarly govern types of higher differential geometry.
A class of examples where aspects of higher Cartan geometry may be seen to secretly underlie traditional discussion is the theory of super p-brane sigma-models on supergravity target-super-spacetimes. This we consider in the examples below. See also at super-Cartan geometry.
It is therefore maybe curious to note that while Cartan geometry as originating in (Cartan 23) drew its motivation from the mathematical formulation of the theory of Einstein gravity, higher Cartan geometry is well motivated by higher dimensional supergravity such as 10d type II supergravity and heterotic supergravity as well as 11-dimensional supergravity.

Super-Poincaré-geometry, Super pp-brane geometry
Notice that ordinary gravity can be understood as the theory of (O(d,1)↪Iso(d,1))(O(d,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(d,1))-Cartan geometry, where Iso(d,1)Iso(d,1) is the Poincare group and O(d,1)O(d,1) the orthogonal group of Minkowski space. This is called the first order formulation of gravity.
One can read the D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity as saying that higher dimensional supergravity is analogously given by higher Cartan supergeometry. See there and see the examples at higher Klein geometry for more on this.
The notion of Klein geometry is essentially that of homogeneous space (coset space) G/HG/H in the context of differential geometry. This is named “Klein geometry” due to its central role in Felix Klein‘s Erlangen program, see below at History.
Klein geometries form the local models for Cartan geometries.
For the generalization of Klein geometry to higher category theory see higher Klein geometry.
A Klein geometry is a pair (G,H)(G, H) where GG is a Lie group and HH is a closed Lie subgroup of GG such that the (left) coset space
X≔G/H
   X \coloneqq G/H


is connected. GG acts transitively on the homogeneous space XX. We may think of H↪GH\hookrightarrow G as the stabilizer subgroup of a point in XX.
See there at Examples – Stabilizers of shapes / Klein geometry.
Higher Klein geometry is the generalization of Klein geometry from traditional (differential) geometry to higher geometry:
where Klein geometry is about (Lie) groups and their quotients, higher Klein geometry is about (smooth) ∞-groups and their ∞-quotients.
The way that the generalization proceeds is clear after the following observation.

Observation
Let GG be a discrete group and H↪GH \hookrightarrow G a subgroup. Write BG\mathbf{B}G and BH\mathbf{B}H for the corresponding delooping groupoids with a single object. Then the action groupoid G//HG//H is the homotopy fiber of the inclusion functor
BH→BG
  \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G


in the (2,1)-category Grpd: we have a fiber sequence
G//H→BH→BG
  G//H \to \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G


that exhibits G//HG//H as the GG-principal bundle over BH\mathbf{B}H which is classified by the cocycle BH→BG\mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G.
Moreover, the decategorification of the action groupoid (its 0-truncation) is the ordinary quotient
τ 0(G//H)=G/H.
  \tau_0 (G//H) = G/H
  \,.



Proof
This should all be explained in detail at action groupoid.
The fact that a quotient is given by a homotopy fiber is a special case of the general theorem discussed at ∞-colimits with values in ∞Grpd


Remark
That fiber sequence continues to the left as
H→G→G//H→BH→BG.
  H \to G \to G//H \to \mathbf{B}H \to \mathbf{B}G
  \,.



Observation
The above statement remains true verbatim if discrete groups are generalized to Lie groups – or other cohesive groups – if only we pass from the (2,1)-topos Grpd of discrete groupoids to the (2,1)-topos SmoothGrpd of smooth groupoids .

This follows with the discussion at smooth ∞-groupoid – structures.
Since the quotient G/HG/H is what is called a Klein geometry and since by the above observations we have analogs of these quotients for higher cohesive groups, there is then an evident definition of higher Klein geometry :
Let H\mathbf{H} be a choice of cohesive structure. For instance choose


H=\mathbf{H} =  Disc∞Grpd for discrete higher Klein geometry (no actual geometric structure);


H=\mathbf{H} =  ETop∞Grpd for continuous higher Klein geometry (with topological structure);


H=\mathbf{H} =  Smooth∞Grpd for higher Klein geometry based on differential geometry;


H=\mathbf{H} =  SuperSmooth∞Grpd for the supergeometry version of higher Klein geometry


and so on.



Definition
An ∞\infty-Klein geometry in H\mathbf{H} is a fiber sequence in H\mathbf{H}
G//H→BH→iBG
  G//H \to \mathbf{B}H \stackrel{i}{\to} \mathbf{B}G


for ii any morphism between two connected objects, as indicated, hence Ωi:H→G\Omega i : H \to G any morphism of ∞-group objects.


Remark
For XX an object equipped with a GG-action and f:Y→Xf : Y \to X any morphism, the higher Klein geometry induced by “the shape YY in XX” is given by taking i:H→Gi : H \to G be the stabilizer ∞-group Stab(f)→GStab(f) \to G of ff in XX. See there at Examples – Stabilizers of shapes / Klein geometry.


Remarks


By the discussion at looping and delooping, and using that a cohesive (∞,1)-topos has homotopy dimension 0 it follows that every connected object indeed is the delooping of an ∞-group object.


The above says that G//HG//H is the principal ∞-bundle over BH\mathbf{B}H that is classified by the cocycle ii.
Continuing this fiber sequence further to the left yields the long fiber sequence
H→G→G//H→BH→iBG
  H \to G \to G//H \to \mathbf{B}H \stackrel{i}{\to} \mathbf{B}G


This exhibits GG indeed as the fiber of G//H→BHG//H \to \mathbf{B}H.



A G-structure on an nn-manifold MM, for a given structure group GG, is a GG-subbundle of the frame bundle (of the tangent bundle) of MM.
Equivalently, this means that a GG-structure is a choice of reduction of the canonical structure group GL(n) of the principal bundle to which the tangent bundle is associated along the given inclusion G↪GL(n)G \hookrightarrow GL(n).
More generally, one can consider the case GG is not a subgroup but equipped with any group homomorphism G→GL(n)G \to GL(n). If this is instead an epimorphism one speaks of a lift of structure groups.
Both cases, in turn, can naturally be understood as special cases of twisted differential c-structures, which is a notion that applies more generally to principal infinity-bundles.
In this language, a GG-structure is a lift in classifying stacks (differentiable delooping stacks BG\mathbf{B}G of Lie groups GG) of the classifying map of the tangent bundle
  BG   Gstructure↗ ↓ str X ⟶⊢TX BGL(n)
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B}G
    \\
    &  
    {}^{ \mathllap{G structure} }\nearrow
    & \big\downarrow^{ str }
    \\
    X 
      &\underset{
        \vdash T X
      }{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{B} GL(n)
  }


Beware the distinction to tangential structure on XX, where such a lift is considered (only) at the level of underlying classifying spaces.
General
Given a smooth manifold XX of dimension nn and given a Lie subgroup G↪GL(n)G \hookrightarrow GL(n) of the general linear group, then a GG-structure on XX is a reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle of XX to GG.
There are many more explicit (and more abstract) equivalent ways to say this, which we discuss below. There are also many evident variants and generalizations.
Notably one may consider reductions of the frames in the kkth order jet bundle. (e. g. Alekseevskii) This yields order kk GG-structure and the ordinary GG-structures above are then first order.
Moreover, the definition makes sense for generalized manifolds modeled on other base spaces than just Cartesian spaces. In particular there are evident generalizations to supermanifolds and to complex manifolds.
In terms of subbundles of the frame bundle

Definition
Given a smooth manifold XX of dimension nn with frame bundle Fr(X)Fr(X), and given a Lie group monomorphism
G⟶GL(ℝ n)
  G \longrightarrow GL(\mathbb{R}^n)


into the general linear group, then a GG-structure on XX is an GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X equipped with an inclusion of fiber bundles
P  ↪  Fr(X)  ↘  ↙   X
  \array{
    P &&\hookrightarrow&& Fr(X)
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }


which is GG-equivariant.

(Sternberg 64, section VII, def. 2.1).

Remark
From this perspective, a GG-structure consists of the collection of all GG-frames on a manifold. For instance for an orthogonal structure it consists of all those frames which are pointwise an orthonormal basis of the tangent bundle (with respect to the Riemannian metric which is defined by the orthonormal structure).

Accordingly:

Definition
Given G↪GL(n)G \hookrightarrow GL(n) and given any one frame field σ:X→Fr(X)\sigma \colon X \to Fr(X) over a manifold XX, then acting with GG on σ\sigma at each point produces a GG-subbundle. This is called the GG-structure generated by the frame field σ\sigma.

In terms of Cartan connections
A GG-structure equipped with compatible connection data is equivalently a Cartan connection for the inclusion (G↪ℝ n⋊G)(G \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \rtimes G).
See at Cartan connection – Examples – G-structures
In higher differential geometry
GG-structure on a KK-principal bundle
We give an equivalent definition of GG-structures in terms of higher differential geometry (“from the nPOV”). This serves to clarify the slightly subtle but important difference between existence and choice of GG-structure, and seamlessly embeds the notion into the more general context of twisted differential c-structures.

Definition
Let G→KG \to K be a homomorphism of Lie groups. Write
c:BG→BK
  \mathbf{c} : \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K


for the morphism of delooping Lie groupoids ( the smooth moduli stacks of smooth KK- and GG-principal bundles, respectively).
For XX a smooth manifold (or generally an orbifold or Lie groupoid, etc.) Let P→XP \to X be a KK-principal bundle and let
k:X⟶BK
  k \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbf{B}K


be any choice of morphism modulating it.
Write H(X,BG)\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G) etc. for the hom-groupoid of smooth groupoids / smooth stacks . This is equivalently the groupoid of GG-principal bundles over XX and smooth gauge transformations between them.
Then the groupoid of GG-structure on PP (with respect to the given morphism G→KG \to K) is the homotopy pullback
cStruc [P](X):=H(X,BG)× H(X,BK){k}.
  \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
  :=
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
   \times_{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)}
  \{k\}
  \,.

cStruc [P](X) ⟶ * ↓ ⇙ ≃ ↓ k H(X,BG) ⟶H(X,c) H(X,BK)
  \array{
    \mathbf{c}Struc_{[P]}(X)
    &\longrightarrow&
    \ast
    \\
    \downarrow & \swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{k}}
    \\
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{\mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{c})}{\longrightarrow}&
    \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}K)
  }


(the groupoid of twisted c-structures).


Remark
If here kk is trivial in that it factors through the point, k:X→*→BKk \colon X \to \ast \to \mathbf{B}K then this homotopy fiber product is H(X,K/G)\mathbf{H}(X,K/G), where K/GK/G is the coset space (Klein geometry) which itself sits in the homotopy fiber sequence
K/G→BG→BK.
   K/G \to \mathbf{B}G \to \mathbf{B}K
  \,.



Example
Specifically, when XX is a smooth manifold of dimension nn, the frame bundle Fr(X)Fr(X) is modulated? by a morphism τ X:X→BGL(n)\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B} GL(n) into the moduli stack for the general linear group K:=GL(n)K := GL(n). Then for any group homomorphism G→GL(n)G \to GL(n), a GG-structure on XX is a GG-structure on Fr(X)Fr(X), as above.

GG-Structure on an etale ∞\infty-groupoid
We discuss the concept in the generality of higher differential geometry, formalized in differential cohesion.

Integrability of GG-structure

Definition
A GG-structure on a manifold XX is called locally flat (Sternberg 64, section VII, def. 24) or integrable (e.g. Alekseevskii) if it is locally equivalent to the standard flat GG-structure, def. .
This means that there is an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} by open subsets of the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n such that the restriction of the GG-structure to each of these is equivalent to the standard flat GG-structure.

See at integrability of G-structures for more on this
The obstruction to integrability of GG-structure is the torsion of a G-structure. See there for more.
Relation to special holonomy
The existence of GG-structures on tangent bundles of Riemannian manifolds is closely related to these having special holonomy.

Theorem
Let (X,g)(X,g) be a connected Riemannian manifold of dimension nn with holonomy group Hol(g)⊂O(n)Hol(g) \subset O(n).
For G⊂O(n)G \subset O(n) some other subgroup, (X,g)(X,g) admits a torsion-free G-structure precisely if Hol(g)Hol(g) is conjugate to a subgroup of GG.
Moreover, the space of such GG-structures is the coset G/LG/L, where LL is the group of elements suchthat conjugating Hol(g)Hol(g) with them lands in GG.

This appears as (Joyce prop. 3.1.8)
The integrability of G-structures exists to first order, precisely if a certain torsion obstruction vanishes. This is the first in an infinite tower of tensor invariants in Spencer cohomology associated with a GG-structure that obstruct its integrability (local flatness) (Guillemin 65).
The torsion of a GG-structure is defined to be the space in which the invariant part of the torsion of a Cartan connection takes values, for any Cartan connection compatible with the GG-structure (see at Cartan connection – Examples – G-Structure) (Sternberg 64, from p. 317 on, Guillemin 65, section 4), for review see also (Lott 90, p.10, Joyce 00, section 2.6).
The order kk-torsion of a GG-structure (counting may differ by 1) is an element in a certain Spencer cohomology group (Guillemin 65, prop. 4.2) and is the obstruction to lifting an order-kk-integrable G-structure to order k+1k+1 (Guillemin 65, theorem 4.1).
Euclidean geometry (Euclid 300BC) studies the geometry of Euclidean spaces. These spaces come equipped with a canonical metric in the sense of analysis, in fact a Riemannian metric, and Euclidean geometry may be regarded as the local model for Riemannian geometry, in the sense of Cartan geometry.
In distinction from non-Euclidean geometry (hyperbolic geometry or elliptic geometry), Euclidean geometry is Riemannian geometry of Riemannian manifolds with zero sectional curvature.

Non-Euclidean geometry


Riemannian geometry of Riemannian manifolds with constant negative sectional curvature.
non-Euclidean geometry for constant positive sectional curvature.
The notion of pseudo-Riemannian metric is a slight variant of that of Riemannian metric.
Where a Riemannian metric is governed by a positive-definite bilinear form, a Pseudo-Riemannian metric is governed by an indefinite bilinear form.
This is equivalently the Cartan geometry modeled on the inclusion of a Lorentz group into a Poincaré group.
A pseudo-Riemannian “metric” is a nondegenerate quadratic form on a real vector space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n. A Riemannian metric is a positive-definite quadratic form on a real vector space. The data of such a quadratic form may be equivalently given by a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear pairing ⟨,⟩\langle\, , \, \rangle on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.
A pseudo-Riemannian metric
Q:ℝ n→ℝQ: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}
can always be diagonalized: there exists a basis e 1,…,e ne_1, \ldots, e_n such that
Q(∑ 1≤i≤nx ie i)=x 1 2+…+x p 2−x p+1 2−…−x n 2Q(\sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} x_i e_i) = x_1^2 + \ldots + x_p^2 - x_{p+1}^2 - \ldots - x_n^2
where the pair (p,n−p)(p, n-p) is called the signature of the form QQ. Pseudo-Riemannian metrics on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n are classified by their signatures; thus we have a standard metric of signature (p,n−p)(p, n-p) where {e 1,…,e n}\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\} is the standard basis of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.
More generally, there is a notion of pseudo-Riemannian manifold (of type (p,n−p)(p, n-p), which is an nn-dimensional manifold MM equipped with a global section
σ:M→S 2(T *M)\sigma: M \to S^2(T^* M)
of the bundle of symmetric bilinear forms over MM, such that each σ(x)\sigma(x) is a nondegenerate form on the tangent space T x(M)T_x(M).
Certain theorems of Riemannian geometry carry over to the more general pseudo-Riemannian setting; for example, pseudo-Riemannian manifolds admit Levi-Civita connections, or in other words a unique notion of covariant differentiation of vector fields
∇:(X,Y)↦∇ X(Y)\nabla: (X, Y) \mapsto \nabla_X(Y)
such that
X⋅⟨Y,Z⟩=⟨∇ XY,Z⟩+⟨Y,∇ XZ⟩X \cdot \langle Y, Z\rangle = \langle \nabla_X Y, Z\rangle + \langle Y, \nabla_X Z\rangle
[X,Y]=∇ XY−∇ YX[X, Y] = \nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X
In that case, one may define a notion of geodesic in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds MM, and we have a notion of “distance squared” between the endpoints along any geodesic path α:[0,1]→M\alpha: [0, 1] \to M (which might be a negative number of course). The term “pseudo-Riemannian metric” may refer to such distances in general pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. (I guess.)
A typical example of pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a Lorentzian manifold, where the metric is of type (1,n−1)(1, n-1). This is particularly so in the case n=4n = 4, where such manifolds are the mathematical backdrop for studying general relativity and cosmological models.

The terminology “metric” is not optimal of course: the values of the quadratic form would need to be nonnegative to avoid terminological conflict with metric as it is more commonly understood (and even in that case, the values of “metric” refer to the square of the metric rather than the metric itself). Caveat lector.

Riemannian geometry studies smooth manifolds that are equipped with a Riemannian metric: Riemannian manifolds.
Riemannian geometry is hence equivalently the Cartan geometry for inclusions of the orthogonal group into the Euclidean group.
The idea of an orthogonal structure is a generalisation to arbitrary vector bundles of the distinguishing ingredient of a Riemannian manifold: the Riemannian metric. In short, an orthogonal structure on a vector bundle is a smooth choice of inner product on the fibres.
In finite dimensions, that is pretty much all that can be said about the basic definition. For infinite dimensional manifolds, however, there is considerably more to be said because the linear notion of an inner product is much, much richer.
Although the definition makes sense in the topological category, we shall confine ourselves to the smooth category for the time being.

Definition
Let π:E→M\pi \colon E \to M be a smooth vector bundle over a smooth manifold. An orthogonal structure on EE is a smooth choice of inner product on EE. That is to say, an orthogonal structure gg on EE is a section of E *⊗E *E^* \otimes E^* which restricts to an inner product on each fibre.

As for Riemannian metrics, a standard partition of unity argument yields the following existence result.

Proposition
Let π:E→M\pi \colon E \to M be a smooth vector bundle with finite dimensional fibres which admits a trivialisation over a numerable cover. Then EE admits an orthogonal structure.

Moreover, in finite dimensions all orthogonal structures are equivalent in that there is a bundle isomorphism between any two.
Reduction of structure Groups
In finite dimensions
In finite dimensions, to put an orthogonal structure on a vector bundle is to give a reduction of its structure group from the general linear group to the corresponding orthogonal subgroup along the defining inclusion O(n)↪GL(n)O(n) \hookrightarrow GL(n). Such a reduction is also known as a choice of vielbein.
Thus the existence in general is equivalent to the fact that the inclusions O(n)→GL(n)O(n) \to GL(n) and U(n)→GL(n)U(n) \to GL(n) are homotopy equivalences, as for the inclusion of any maximal compact subgroup. A similar statement can be made about the fact that any two orthogonal structures are equivalent.
In infinite Dimensions
The situation in infinite dimensions is more complicated due to the fact that there are more situations to consider. In finite dimensions, any two orthogonal structures are equivalent, which stems from the fact that any two inner products define equivalent norms in finite dimensions. In infinite dimensions, it is no longer true even that all locally convex topological vector spaces admit inner products, and when one does then it is highly unlikely that it will admit only one (up to equivalence).
What gives Riemannian geometry much of its power is the induced isomorphism between the tangent and cotangent bundles. Thus a natural first question to ask of an orthogonal structure in infinite dimensions is whether or not this is still true.

Question: Does the orthogonal structure induce an isomorphism E≅E *E \cong E^*?
Yes: It is strong.
No: It is weak.

The condition that an orthogonal structure be strong is very restrictive. The bundle must be modelled on Hilbert spaces (with the correct topology) and the inner product must be the right choice. Many orthogonal structures that occur “in the wild” do not fit those two conditions and are thus relegated to the “weak” bin. However, all is not lost and it is still possible to work with such orthogonal structures. Although a weak orthogonal structure means that the bundle is not modelled on Hilbert spaces, it does mean that there are Hilbert spaces nearby and it is possible to further refine the notion of a “weak orthogonal structure” by asking how “nice” are those associated Hilbert spaces.
The idea is quite simple. To put an orthogonal structure on a vector space, say VV, is to give an injection V→HV \to H in to some Hilbert space. We can assume that VV has dense image, but this is not strictly necessary. Thus an inner product is a diagram:
ι:V→H
\iota \colon V \to H


and the classification of weak orthogonal structures is essentially a study of how well that diagram extends over the base space.
An isometry is a function that preserves a metric, either in the sense of a metric space or in the sense of a Riemannian manifold.
A Killing vector on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold is equivalently


a covariantly constant vector field : a vector field v∈Γ(TC)v \in \Gamma(T C) that is annihilated by (the symmetrization of) the covariant derivative of the corresponding Levi-Civita connection;


an infinitesimal isometry.


Similarly a Killing spinor is a covariantly constant spinor.
For (X,g)(X,g) a Riemannian manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold) a vector field v∈Γ(TX)v \in \Gamma(T X) is called a Killing vector field if it generates isometries of the metric gg. More precisely, if, equivalently


the Lie derivative of gg along vv vanishes: ℒ vg=0\mathcal{L}_v g = 0;


the flow exp(v):X×ℝ→X\exp(v)  : X \times \mathbb{R} \to X is a flow by isometries.


The flows of Killing vectors are isometries of the Riemannian manifold onto itself.
A Killing spinor on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold XX is a spinor – a section of some spinor bundle v∈Γ(S)v \in \Gamma(S) – that is taken by the covariant derivative of the corresponding Levi-Civita connection to a multiple of itself
∇ vψ=κγ vψ
  \nabla_v \psi = \kappa \gamma_v \psi


for some constant κ\kappa.
If that constant is 0, hence if the spinor is covariant constant, then one also speaks of a covariant constant spinor or parallel spinor (with respect to the given metric structure).
More generally, a twistor spinor or conformal Killing spinor is a ψ\psi such that
∇ vψ=1dim(X)γ vDψ,
  \nabla_v \psi = \frac{1}{dim(X)} \gamma_v D \psi
  \,,


where DD is the given Dirac operator (e.g. Baum 00).
A Killing spinor with non-vanishing κ\kappa may be understood as a genuine covariantly constant spinor, but with respect to a super-Cartan geometry modeled not on super-Euclidean space/super-Minkowski spacetime, but on its spherical/hyperbolic or deSitter/anti-deSitter versions (Egeileh-Chami 13, p. 60 (8/8)).
Similarly a Killing vector is a covariantly constant vector field.
Pairing two covariant constant spinors to a vector yields a Killing vector.
In supergravity, super spacetimes which solves the equations of motion and admit Killing spinors are BPS states (at least if they are asymptotically flat and of finite mass).

General
A spacetime is a manifold that models space and time in physics.
This is formalized by saying that a spacetime is a smooth Lorentzian space (X,μ)(X,\mu) equipped with a time orientation (see there).
Hence a point in a spacetime is called an event.
In the context of classical general relativity a spacetime is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional. A connected Lorentzian manifold is either time orientable or it has a two-sheeted covering which is time orientable.
In classical physics, notably in special relativity and general relativity points in XX model coordinates where events can take place from the viewpoint of an observer (“points in space and time”) while the metric μ\mu models the field of gravity in general relativity.
Intermingling of space and time
The noun “spacetime” is used in both special relativity and general relativity, but is best motivated from the viewpoint of general relativity. Special relativity deals with the Minkowski spacetime only. The Minkowski spacetime allows a canonical choice of global coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.
Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined canonical time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the physical interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates changes over the domain of definition.
(TODO: references and explanations).

A spacetime in supergeometry, used in some formulations of supergravity (see at D'Auria-Fre formulation of supergravity) and as target space for super-pp-brane sigma-models (see at Green-Schwarz action functional).
In complex geometry one studies complex manifolds as a special case of how in general differential geometry one studies more generally smooth manifolds.
In complex analytic geometry one studies, more generally, complex analytic spaces.
GAGA principle and relation to algebraic geometry
complex analytic geometry is closely related to algebraic geometry over the complex numbers. See at GAGA for more on this.
Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry studying symplectic manifolds and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical apparatus of classical mechanics and geometric optics (and the related WKB-method in quantum mechanics and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in harmonic analysis). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is Poisson geometry and a sister branch in odd dimensions is contact geometry. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds, which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of Mikhail Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of Andreas Floer giving birth to symplectic topology or “hard methods” of symplectic geometry.
A conformal structure on a manifold is the structure of a Riemannian metric modulo rescalings of the metric tensor by some real valued function on the manifold. The homomorphisms of conformal structures are called conformal transformations.
In terms of Cartan geometry conformal structure is expressed by conformal connections, conformal geometry is a special case of parabolic geometry and hence of Cartan geometry.
In the context of quantum field theory conformal structure underlies the formulation of conformal field theory. Due to the coincidence of the conformal group of Minkowski spacetime of dimension dd with the anti de Sitter group of anti de Sitter spacetime in dimension d+1d+1 there is a close relation between certain conformal field theories and certain theories of gravity. This is the content of the AdS-CFT correspondence. This works most accurately in the context of supergeometry, hence for superconformal groups acting on the asymptotic boundary of super anti de Sitter spacetimes.
Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
Higher geometry or homotopical geometry is the study of concepts of space and geometry in the context of higher category theory and homotopy theory.

Slogan
higher geometry = geometry + homotopy theory/higher category theory

Higher geometry subsumes notably the theory of orbifolds and geometric stacks, as well as the theory of more general stacks such as moduli stacks, and generalizes all this to ∞-stacks and derived stacks. This way higher geometry includes what is called derived geometry and it subsumes at least parts of (derived) noncommutative geometry. Many other phenomena are naturally part of higher geometry, see the list of Examples below.
In any given instance of higher geometry, one starts with a notion of “local models” for the geometry. An affine space will then be a formal dual of such a local model, and a general space will be formed by “gluing” these affine spaces in some appropriate way. There are two ways of formalizing this idea, coming from Alexander Grothendieck‘s two definitions of scheme in algebraic geometry via locally ringed spaces and functors of points. Both are built on (∞,1)-topos theory: in one direction, a petit (∞,1)-topos (with some additional structure) encodes a space itself; in another direction, a space is an object of a gros (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks on some (∞,1)-site. We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
These approaches do not apply to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which requires a different approach to deal with a more complicated notion of gluing; we discuss this below in Noncommutative algebraic geometry.

Noncommutative algebraic geometry
The above frameworks for higher geometry are not suitable for describing noncommutative algebraic geometry, because of the more complicated notions of localization, gluing and descent in the latter setting. Indeed, noncommutative spaces are supposed to be obtained from affine ones (formal duals of associative algebras or dg-algebras) by gluing along bimodules. A good setting for such gluing is that of pretriangulated dg-categories (or stable (∞,1)-categories). Thus in derived noncommutative algebraic geometry, a noncommutative space is defined to be a stable (∞,1)-category.
Connes-style noncommutative geometry
The process of forming groupoid convolution algebras is a 2-functor from suitable topological and differentiable stacks to C*-algebras with Hilbert bimodules between them. Much of Connes-style noncommutative geometry turns out to deal with objects in the image of this functor, and to the extent that it does, Connes-style noncommutative geometry may be regarded as being a way of speaking about higher geometry, specifically the higher differential geometry of differentiable stacks.
The notion of quantum field theory exists without reference to any predefined notion of configuration space of quantum fields, action functional, phase space etc.:
A quantum field theory in FQFT-axiomatization is simply a consistent assignment of spaces of quantum states, whereas in AQFT-axiomatization it is a consistent assignment of algebras of quantum observables, and that’s it.
However, most (or maybe all?) quantum field theories of interest in actual physics (as opposed to as devices of pure mathematics) are not random models of these axioms, but do arise under a process called quantization from a (local/extended) Lagrangian, hence from an action functional, defined on a configuration space of quantum fields, or else arise as holographic duals of quantum field theories that arise by quantization. Moreover, the extra information provided by the Lagrangian is commonly used (and is maybe strictly necessary) to interpret the mathematical structure of the axiomatic QFT in actual physics (though notably in AQFT there are results that re-extract at least parts of this data from the axiomatic QFT, for instance the Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction theorem which extract the global gauge group from the local net of quantum observables).
There are in turn two formalizations of the notion of quantization: algebraic deformation quantization and geometric quantization. In the latter one speaks of prequantization when referring to a precursor step to the actual quantization step, in which the symplectic form on phase space is lifted to differential cohomology, hence to a prequantum bundle. But in the context of higher geometry and higher geometric quantization this prequantization step is already part of the data of the Lagrangian itself: an extended Lagrangian already encodes not just the action functional but also the prequantum bundle and all the prequantum (n-k)-bundles in each dimension kk. The action functional itself is the prequantum 0-bundle in this context.
Therefore, in the refined picture of higher geometry/extended quantum field theory it makes good sense to refer in a unified way to prequantum field theory for all of the data related to Lagrangians that is not yet the final quantum field theory.
In particular, an extended prequantum field theory of dimension nn is a rule that assigns


to every (suitably oriented) closed manifold of dimension kk a prequantum (n-k)-bundle


to every (suitably oriented) compact manifold with boundary Σ k\Sigma_k a section of the prequantum (n−k+1)(n-k+1)-bundle assigned to the boundary ∂Σ k\partial \Sigma_k and pulled back to the space of fields over Σ k\Sigma_k


such that this data is related suitably under transgression.
The actual extended quantum field theory would be obtained from such a data by passing from the assignment of a given prequantum (n−k)(n-k)-bundle to that of the (n-k)-vector space of polarized sections of a suitable associated fiber bundle.
This is summarized in the following table:

Higher differential geometry is the incarnation of differential geometry in higher geometry. Hence it is concerned with n-groupoid-versions of smooth spaces for higher nn, where the traditional theory is contained in the case n=0n = 0. For n=1n = 1 these higher structures are Lie groupoids, differentiable stacks, their infinitesimal approximation by Lie algebroids and the generalization to smooth stacks. For higher nn this includes (deloopings of) Lie 2-groups, Lie 3-groups.
Fully generally, higher differential geometry hence replaces smooth manifolds (and possibly variants such as supermanifolds, formal manifolds, dg-manifolds etc.) by ∞-stacks ((∞,1)-sheaves) on the site of all such. Technically this means that higher differential geometry is the study of an (∞,1)-topos into which standard differential geometry faithfully embeds. This then allows to speak of smooth ∞-groups, Lie ∞-algebroids.
If the ambient (∞,1)-topos is not 1-localic (for instance over a genuine site of dg-manifolds) then one also speaks of derived differential geometry.
See at motivation for higher differential geometry for motivation.
The standard variants of differential geometry have their higher analogs, for instance symplectic geometry generalizes to higher symplectic geometry and prequantum geometry to higher prequantum geometry.
Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.

Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Higher geometry or homotopical geometry is the study of concepts of space and geometry in the context of higher category theory and homotopy theory.

Slogan
higher geometry = geometry + homotopy theory/higher category theory

Higher geometry subsumes notably the theory of orbifolds and geometric stacks, as well as the theory of more general stacks such as moduli stacks, and generalizes all this to ∞-stacks and derived stacks. This way higher geometry includes what is called derived geometry and it subsumes at least parts of (derived) noncommutative geometry. Many other phenomena are naturally part of higher geometry, see the list of Examples below.
In any given instance of higher geometry, one starts with a notion of “local models” for the geometry. An affine space will then be a formal dual of such a local model, and a general space will be formed by “gluing” these affine spaces in some appropriate way. There are two ways of formalizing this idea, coming from Alexander Grothendieck‘s two definitions of scheme in algebraic geometry via locally ringed spaces and functors of points. Both are built on (∞,1)-topos theory: in one direction, a petit (∞,1)-topos (with some additional structure) encodes a space itself; in another direction, a space is an object of a gros (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks on some (∞,1)-site. We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
These approaches do not apply to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which requires a different approach to deal with a more complicated notion of gluing; we discuss this below in Noncommutative algebraic geometry.

Noncommutative algebraic geometry
The above frameworks for higher geometry are not suitable for describing noncommutative algebraic geometry, because of the more complicated notions of localization, gluing and descent in the latter setting. Indeed, noncommutative spaces are supposed to be obtained from affine ones (formal duals of associative algebras or dg-algebras) by gluing along bimodules. A good setting for such gluing is that of pretriangulated dg-categories (or stable (∞,1)-categories). Thus in derived noncommutative algebraic geometry, a noncommutative space is defined to be a stable (∞,1)-category.
Connes-style noncommutative geometry
The process of forming groupoid convolution algebras is a 2-functor from suitable topological and differentiable stacks to C*-algebras with Hilbert bimodules between them. Much of Connes-style noncommutative geometry turns out to deal with objects in the image of this functor, and to the extent that it does, Connes-style noncommutative geometry may be regarded as being a way of speaking about higher geometry, specifically the higher differential geometry of differentiable stacks.
The theory of (∞,1)-toposes, generalizing topos theory from category theory to (∞,1)-category theory: “geometric homotopy theory”.
In physics, the Pauli exclusion principle (Pauli 25) states that no two spinors may inhabit the same quantum state. This is a consequence of the spin-statistics theorem, which states that spinors must be fermions.
Mathematically this is the statement that fermion fields are the odd-graded elements of a superalgebra of functions in supergeometry.
The Pauli exclusion principle implies that fermions, as opposed to bosons, may form solid bodies that do not necessarily collapse under their own gravity (as opposed to bosonic condensates): the exclusion principle induces an outward pressure, the degeneracy pressure (see also at Fermi sea and neutron star). It is used in the explanation of the stability of matter of the second kind.
Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.

The term ‘space’ is quite generic and can mean many different things depending on context. Often we will link it because we want to include many of these contexts at once!
Probably the default spaces are topological spaces (as defined by Bourbaki), with continuous maps between them. There are many variants, from convergence spaces (general) to metric (metrisable) spaces (specific), all of which fall under the topic of topology. An important variation gives locales; many of the theorems from topology that require the axiom of choice for Bourbaki spaces become constructively valid for locales.
Often one restricts to nice topological spaces or to a nice category of spaces; these are not always the same kind of restriction! There are many examples under those two headings; m-cofibrant spaces in particular allow one to identify homotopy equivalence with weak homotopy equivalence. More generally in homotopy theory, one uses the homotopy hypothesis to identify spaces with ∞\infty-groupoids, of which there are several models. Since one common model is simplicial sets, some homotopy theorists use “space” to mean “simplicial set.”
Often one is also interested in spaces with additional structure. For instance, smooth manifolds and generalized smooth spaces are spaces with smooth structure, and algebraic varieties and schemes are spaces with algebraic structure. One can also speak more generally of spaces “modeled” on any suitable starting category; in this way one often comes to consider sheaves on a suitable site (and variations such as presheaves, copresheaves, or objects of an Isbell envelope) as spaces. Generalized smooth spaces and schemes are two commonly encountered examples of spaces “modeled” on a starting category in this way.
One can also categorify the concept of space. As space is dual to quantity, space and quantity can be categorified together; see ∞\infty-space and compare ∞\infty-quantity. Other types of categorified spaces include Grothendieck toposes (which are categorified locales) and stacks (which are categorified sheaves) and even their ∞\infty-versions ((∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes and ∞\infty-stacks).
Algebra of function on a set
For RR a ring and SS a set, the set of functions S→RS \to R (to the underlying set of RR) is itself naturally an associative algebra over RR, where addition and multiplication is given pointwise in SS by addition and multiplication in RR: for f 1,f 2:S→Rf_1, f_2 \colon S \to R their sum is the function
(f 1+f 2):s↦f 1(s)+f 2(s)∈R,
  (f_1 + f_2) \colon s \mapsto f_1(s) + f_2(s) \in R
  \,,


their product is the function
(f 1⋅f 2):s↦f 1(s)f 2(s)∈R
  (f_1 \cdot f_2) \colon s \mapsto f_1(s) f_2(s) \in R


and the ring inclusion R→[S,R]R \to [S,R] is given by sending r∈Rr \in R to the constant function with value rr.
Algebra of functions on an ∞\infty-stack
More generally, in the context of (∞,1)-topos theory and higher algebra, there is a notion of function algebras on ∞-stacks.
Relation to free modules
If SS is a finite set or else if one restricts to functions that are non-vanishing only for finitely many elements in SS, then the algebra of functions with values in RR also forms the free module over RR generated by SS.
Duality between algebra and geometry
Sending spaces to their suitable algebras of functions constitutes a basic duality operation that relates geometry and algebra. For more on this see at Isbell duality.
A super-commutative algebra is a commutative algebra internal to the symmetric monoidal category of super vector spaces, hence a ℤ/2\mathbb{Z}/2-graded associative algebra such that for a,ba, b any two elements of homogeneous degree deg(a),deg(b)∈ℤ/2={0,1}deg(a), deg(b) \in \mathbb{Z}/2 = \{0,1\}, we have
a⋅b=(−1) deg(a)deg(b)b⋅a.

   \;\;=\;\; 
  (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)}

In physics, the Pauli exclusion principle (Pauli 25) states that no two spinors may inhabit the same quantum state. This is a consequence of the spin-statistics theorem, which states that spinors must be fermions.
Mathematically this is the statement that fermion fields are the odd-graded elements of a superalgebra of functions in supergeometry.
The Pauli exclusion principle implies that fermions, as opposed to bosons, may form solid bodies that do not necessarily collapse under their own gravity (as opposed to bosonic condensates): the exclusion principle induces an outward pressure, the degeneracy pressure (see also at Fermi sea and neutron star). It is used in the explanation of the stability of matter of the second kind.
On super smooth infinity-groupoids there is a modal operator (−)⇝\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{(-)} which projects onto the bosonic components of the supergeometry. On formal dual superalgebras this is given by passing to the body. In terms of physical fields this is the projection onto boson fields, which are hence the modal types of ⇝\rightsquigarrow, and so it makes sense to speak of the bosonic modality.
This has a left adjoint ⇉\rightrightarrows (which on superalgebras passes to the even-graded sub-algebra) and hence together these form an adjoint modality which may be thought of as characterizing the supergeometry. See at super smooth infinity-groupoid – Cohesion. With ⇉\rightrightarrows being opposite to ⇝\rightsquigarrow thereby, it makes sense to call it the fermionic modality.
Notice that the fermionic currents in physics (e.g. the electron density current) are indeed fermionic bilinears, i.e. are indeed in the even subalgebras of the underlying superalgebra.
fermions ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosons
  \array{
    fermions & \rightrightarrows &\stackrel{}{\dashv}& \rightsquigarrow & bosons
  }


The modal objects for ⇝\rightsquigarrow are the bosonic objects.
The right adjoint of the bosonic modality is the rheonomy modality.
There are at least two formalizations of quantization, one of them is geometric quantization. In this context a quantum state is identified with a certain section (a polarized section) of a certain complex line bundle: the prequantum line bundle.
Here a section of the prequantum line bundle is what is physics is called a wave function or probability amplitude on the space of field configurations. A choice of polarization on this space is a choice of “canonical coordinates” and “canonical momenta”. Hence a polarized section, and hence a quantum state in the sense of geometric quantization, is, in physics language, a wave function of the canonical coordinates.
So the space of states is the subspace of the space of sections of the prequantum line bundle on those that are polarized.
For details see at geometric quantization – Space of quantum states.
The covariant phase space of a system in physics is the space of all of its solutions to its classical equations of motion, the space of trajectories of the system. Often one considers a parameterization of this by boundary data or choice of a Cauchy surface. This parameterization is what traditionally is just called a “phase space”. The “covariant” in “covariant phase space” is to indicated that it comes without any unnatural choices.
For a system described by Lagrangian mechanics, the covariant phase space comes canonically equipped with a presymplectic structure. A proper phase space or reduced phase space is a quotient space of the covariant phase space on which the presymplectic structure refines to a symplectic structure or Poisson strucure.
Typically these phase spaces are (locally) naturally parameterized by the suitable boundary conditions which uniquely determine the corresponding history of the physical system. Much of the literature on phase spaces deals with parameterizing these boundary conditions.
For instance for a non-relativistic particle propagating on a Riemannian manifold XX with the usual action functional, a trajectory is uniquely fixed by the position x∈Xx \in X and the momentum p∈T x *Xp \in T^*_x X of the particle at a given time. Correspondingly the space of all solutions and hence the (covariant) phase space of the system may be identified with the cotangent bundle T *XT^* X of XX.
(The term “phase” in “phase space” can be related to the phase of complex numbers in this example, see at phase and phase space in physics.)
However, even reduced phase spaces are not all cotangent bundles, typically not, for instance, if they are obtained by symplectic reduction. This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general.
In physics there is the notion of a physical system, the totality of all the entities and processes – its mechanics – regarded as being part of the physics under discussion.
A fermion is a particle/quantum field that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics? (Pauli exclusion principle). By the spin-statistics theorem, this is the same thing as a particle whose spin is half an integer but not itself an integer.
In the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology fermions are the matter constituents of the observable universe, as opposed to bosons, which are the quanta of force gauge fields.
The formalization of fermions is in supergeometry: fermion fields are sections of spinor bundles with odd-degree fibers in supergeometry. This is exhibited by what is called Fermi-Dirac statistics? and the Pauli exclusion principle.
There are at least two formalizations of quantization, one of them is geometric quantization. In this context a quantum state is identified with a certain section (a polarized section) of a certain complex line bundle: the prequantum line bundle.
Here a section of the prequantum line bundle is what is physics is called a wave function or probability amplitude on the space of field configurations. A choice of polarization on this space is a choice of “canonical coordinates” and “canonical momenta”. Hence a polarized section, and hence a quantum state in the sense of geometric quantization, is, in physics language, a wave function of the canonical coordinates.
So the space of states is the subspace of the space of sections of the prequantum line bundle on those that are polarized.
For details see at geometric quantization – Space of quantum states.
A super-commutative algebra is a commutative algebra internal to the symmetric monoidal category of super vector spaces, hence a ℤ/2\mathbb{Z}/2-graded associative algebra such that for a,ba, b any two elements of homogeneous degree deg(a),deg(b)∈ℤ/2={0,1}deg(a), deg(b) \in \mathbb{Z}/2 = \{0,1\}, we have
a⋅b=(−1) deg(a)deg(b)b⋅a.

Basic idea
In the general sense, superalgebra is the study of (higher) algebra

internal to the symmetric monoidal category of ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded vector spaces (super vector spaces);

equivalently

over the base topos on superpoints.

More specifically, a supercommutative superalgebra is an commutative algebra in the context of superalgebra.
See at geometry of physics – superalgebra for more on this.
In the following we first discuss

Associative superalgebras

as monoids in the symmetric monoidal category of super vector spaces. Then we pass to the perspective of

Algebra in the topos over superpoints

and consider systematically algebra in the sheaf topos over the site of superpoints and show how this reproduces and generalizes the previous notions.
See (Sachse) and the references at super ∞-groupoid for some history of the topos-theoretic perspective on superalgebra.
Abstract idea
We discuss the general abstract raison d’ être of super algebra. Readers looking for just the plain definition should probably skip to below on first reading.
One way to understand the relevance of supercommutative superalgebra is Deligne's theorem on tensor categories, which states that well-behaved tensor categories over the complex numbers are equivalent to categories of representations of supergroups. From this perspective the crucial sign rule is related to the symmetric braiding in tensor categories. This in turn may itself be understood from a more general perspective as follows.
Superalgebra is universal in the following sense. The crucial super-grading rule (the “Koszul sign rule”, Grassmann 1844, §37, §55)
a⊗b=(−1) deg(a)deg(b)b⊗a
  a \otimes b = (-1)^{deg(a) deg(b)} b \otimes a


in the symmetric monoidal category of ℤ\mathbb{Z}-graded vector spaces is induced from the subcategory which is the abelian 2-group of metric graded lines. This in turn is the free abelian 2-group (groupal symmetric monoidal category) on a single generator. (This point of view is amplified in the first part of (Kapranov 13), whose second part is about super 2-algebra, more details in Kapranov 15). Generally then super-grading and hence super-algebra arises from the 2-truncation (3-coskeleton) of the free abelian ∞-group on a single generator, which is the sphere spectrum 𝕊\mathbb{S}. So the ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-grading of superalgebra comes from the stable homotopy groups of spheres π n(𝕊)\pi_n(\mathbb{S}) in degree 1 and 2:
n=n = 0011223344556677⋯\cdotsπ n(𝕊)=\pi_n(\mathbb{S}) = ℤ\mathbb{Z}ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2ℤ 24\mathbb{Z}_{24}0 0 00ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2ℤ 240\mathbb{Z}_{240}⋯\cdots
meaning:degreeboson/fermion super-degreespinstring−-−-??⋯\cdots
free object on single generator:abelian groupabelian 2-groupabelian 3-groupabelian 4-groupabelian 7-groupabelian 8-groupabelian ∞-group

This suggests (as indicated in (Kapranov 13, Kapranov 15)) that in full generality higher supergeometry is to be thought of as 𝕊\mathbb{S}-graded geometry, hence dually as higher algebra with ∞-group of units augmented over the sphere spectrum.
But notice that this is canonically so for every E-∞ ring, see at ∞-group of units – Augmented definition. This would mean: In higher geometry/higher algebra supergeometry/superalgebra is intrinsic, canonically given.

we can derive the terminology in the above table as indicated now.

The following uses the notions of motivic quantization as indicated there, to be expanded.

An algebra which is not a commutative algebra.
A fermion is a particle/quantum field that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics? (Pauli exclusion principle). By the spin-statistics theorem, this is the same thing as a particle whose spin is half an integer but not itself an integer.
In the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology fermions are the matter constituents of the observable universe, as opposed to bosons, which are the quanta of force gauge fields.
The formalization of fermions is in supergeometry: fermion fields are sections of spinor bundles with odd-degree fibers in supergeometry. This is exhibited by what is called Fermi-Dirac statistics? and the Pauli exclusion principle.
The field of quantum field theory started out as a description of the fundamental particles that are observed in experiment, such as electrons and photons.
However, even so, abstractly the formalization of the concept of particle within QFTs is somewhat subtle.
If the quantum field theory is on Minkowski space and comes with a Hilbert space of states on which thus the Poincare group of translations, rotations and boosts in Minkowski space acts, the massive particle excitations of the theory can be found in the discrete spectrum of the time translation operator as the irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. For QFTs on curved spacetimes the situation is more subtle.
Often, however, QFTs are considered as quantizations of given Lagrangians. In these cases one often identifies their particle content with that explicitly encoded by the Lagrangian. Notably when that arises from second quantization of some 1-dimensional sigma-model, the particles of the theory are those described by these sigma-models.
The Stern-Gerlach experiment showed that electrons are spinors. It was the first experimental observation of the elementary spin 12\frac{1}{2} of fermions.
Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
For more see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Supergeometry may defined over an arbitrary commutative ring (Schwarz and Shapiro 06).
Where generally a symmetry is an invariance under a group action (after all the mathematical term “group” is a contraction of group of symmetries), or, infinitesimally, an invariance under a Lie algebra action, in the general sense of the word, a supersymmetry is invariance under a supergroup action or a super Lie algebra action.
By Deligne's theorem on tensor categories it is precisely the context of supersymmetry in which tensor categories over the complex numbers exhibit full Tannaka duality.
In the stricter sense of the word as it originates in theoretical fundamental physics, supersymmetry refers specifically to supergeometric extensions of the isometry group (or its Lie algebra) of the local model of spacetime. For Minkowski spacetime this is the Poincaré group with its Poincaré Lie algebra and their super-extensions are accordingly known as the super Poincaré group and super Poincaré Lie algebra. In physics the latter are often referred to simply as the supersymmetry algebra. An odd element in this super Lie algebra is called a supersymmetry generator and its Hamiltonian is called a supercharge. More generally, if spacetime geometry is taken to be conformal geometry or de Sitter spacetime/anti-de Sitter spacetime, then one considers supergeometric extensions of the conformal group, de Sitter group and anti de Sitter group, respectively, and then these are the relevant “supersymmetries”.
With the focus on spacetime symmetry groups implicitly understood, this implies that supersymmetry is the group theory relevant for super Cartan geometry locally modeled on super Minkowski spacetime or super anti de Sitter spacetime, etc. In terms of physics and in view of the first order formulation of gravity, this means that “locally gauged” supersymmetry is the super-geometric generalization from Einstein gravity to supergravity or, respectively, from conformal field theory to superconformal field theory, etc.
Global supersymmetry and superparticles
By Wigner-Weyl theory we have in ordinary quantum field theory that unitary representations of the Poincaré group correspond to the particles in the theory. For a globally supersymmetric quantum field theory the Poincaré group here is replaced by the super Poincaré group and accordingly particles are now irreducible representations of this group: the irreducible unitary representations of the super Poincaré group. The new – odd graded – pieces of these representations – called supermultiplets – appearing this way are called the superpartners of the original bosonic particles.
Local supersymmetry: supergravity
To be distinguished from this global supersymmetry is local supersymmetry (see at gauge group and at Cartan connection): given a gauge theory whose fields are connections with values in the Poincaré Lie algebra – the theory of gravity in its first order formulation – a supersymmetric extension is similarly a gauge theory with fields being connections in the super Poincaré Lie algebra – a theory of supergravity. A gauge transformation in such a theory is called a local supersymmetry transformation.
The relation between local and global supersymmetry
The distinction between local and global supersymmetry is important when considering supergravity in perturbation theory where all fields are expanded around a fixed spacetime geometry and fixed background gauge fields that form a solution of the Euler-Lagrange equations.
While the theory of supergravity as such has, by definition, local supersymmetry, a solution to it may but need not have any global supersymmetry left. In fact, generically it will not.
To see this, it is maybe helpful to compare with the analogous statement in non-supersymmetric QFT:
the theory of gravity is locally Poincaré-symmetric: in first order formulation it is a Poincaré group gauge theory. Nevertheless, any of its solutions – which is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold – may, but need not, have any Poincaré-symmetry. It does have such a global symmetry for every Killing vector on the spacetime. Such may or may not exist. Generically it does not exist.
The analog of these Killing vectors in supergravity are Killing spinors: covariantly constant spinors (sections of a spinor bundle annihilated by the spin connection‘s covariant derivative). For every such, the background has one global supersymmetry transformation. These may or may not exist. Generically they do not.
The most famous example of this is that of Calabi-Yau manifolds: a standard assumption on phenomenological model building that used to be very popular around the turn of the millennium (but is maybe experimentally ruled out at the time of this writing) is that


the spacetime we see around us locally looks like a product M 4×Y 6M^4 \times Y^6 of 4-dimensional Minkowski space times a tiny closed Riemannian manifold Y 6Y^6 (so tiny that it is not directly observable but manifests itself only by way of its lowest excitation modes that look like different particle species on the remaining M 4M^4 – see Kaluza-Klein mechanism );


such that on this product space a single covariant constant spinor exists, such that the resulting effective theory on M 4M^4 has a single global supersymmetry (“N=1N=1 supersymmetry”).


One finds that this condition is solved precisely by Y 6Y^6 being a Calabi-Yau manifold. For more on this see the corresponding section at heterotic string theory.
But notice that nothing in the theory of 10-dimensional supergravity demands that its solutions have a global supersymmetry left (generically they will not) nor that they factor locally as M 4×Y 6M^4 \times Y^6. All this is an ansatz a phenomenological model . It only says that if we make this ansatz, then Y 6Y^6 needs to be a Calabi-Yau space. In fact, it turns out to be nontrivial to check that with all the other fields taken into account, such a factor ansatz is indeed consistent. (This problem of “moduli stabilization” is discussed a little bit at landscape of string theory vacua.)
Latest experimental results strongly suggest that this model of global (N=1)(N = 1)-supersymmetry at observable energies is not a description of our phenomenological reality. Still, it could well be that the underlying theory of the world is nevertheless not plain general relativity but supergravity.
Observed supersymmetry: on the worldline
To appreciate this point it is worthwhile to notice that supersymmetric quantum field theory in fact has been observed in nature, already since a century ago. To see this, one needs to notice how fundamental particles are described by sigma model quantum field theories (see there) on their worldvolume:
the σ\sigma-model action functional for the standard Dirac spinor particle – such as electrons and quarks, the particles that all the matter in the world is made of – just happens to have worldline supersymmetry. This is discussed at spinning particle . Notice that this is true for electrons and quarks in the non-supersymmetric standard model of particle physics: the target space theory is completely void of (global) supersymmetry, and still the worldvolume theory of any fermion is automatically supersymmetric.
Conjectured supersymmetry: on spacetime and on the worldsheet
A similar statement as for the spinning particle and its automatic local worldline supersymmetry indeed also holds for the spinning string : while it is a conjecture of string theory which has not been experimentally verified that fundamentally the sigma-model theories that describe the physics around us is defined not on 1-dimensional but on 2-dimensional worldvolumes, it remains a noteworthy fact that the standard action functional for the string sigma model with fermions on the worldsheet just happens to be locally supersymmetric. It is hard to avoid this! And indeed, this was how the abstract notion of supersymmetry in quantum field theory was realized in the west first: people wrote down action functionals for spinning strings and noticed that these happened to have an interesting graded symmetry (see there for references).
So while it is an open conjecture of string theory that the particle worldlines that are experimentally observed are secretly really worldsheets, assuming that this conjecture holds for fermions automatically implies local worldsheet supersymmetry and the superstring.
Now, the effective spacetime target space theories arising from second quantization of the superstring are fairly well understood: these are higher dimensional supergravity theories coupled to the various higher gauge fields that are also in the spectrum of the string (the Kalb-Ramond field and the RR-fields, notably). They are called type II supergravity , heterotic supergravity, etc. All of these are obtained by compactifications of 11-dimensional supergravity.
This means that the assumption of spinning string sigma-models automatically implies that the spacetime QFT that we observe also has local supersymmetry.
Over the decades it has often been suggested that therefore the assumption of spinning strings “suggests” or “favours” the observation of superpartner particles in accelerators. However, this is not so:
in these constructions the particle species seen in accelerators are KK-modes and/or brane-brane open string modes of the compactified locally supersymmetric theory. This means that they are determined by the compactification geometry. Only if that has a global Killing spinor is the effective 4-dimensional theory globally supersymmetric and exhibits superpartners. As was mentioned above, for spacetimes of the form M 4×Y 6M^4 \times Y^6 this is the case precisely if Y 6Y^6 is a Calabi-Yau manifold.
But this is far from being the generic situation. This is clear qualitatively (a generic solution to the super-Einstein equations will not have a Killing spinor). A more sophisticated and quantitative argument to the same effect is given, for instance, in (DLSW08).
In fundamental physics
Supersymmetric extensions of quantum field theories have been felt to be compelling in fundamental physics for formal reasons : the simple step from Lie algebras to super Lie algebras


make a pure theory of gravity seamlessly incorporate fermions and gauge fields;


leads to better renormalization properties (indeed the speculation that N=8,D=4N=8, D=4 supergravity is fully renormalizable – in stark contrast to ordinary gravity has more recently been checked up to high loop orders);


produces a wealth of interesting mathematical structures. For instance


Morse theory of a Riemannian manifold can naturally be understood in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for superparticles propagating on that manifold;


the interpretation of quantum field theories in terms of generalized cohomology theories only works for supersymmetric theories (see (1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory and (2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory)


“topological twists” of supersymmetric field theories are a major source of examples of TQFTs, for instance the A-model and the B-model TCFT arise from such twists of 2-dimensional supergravity and there are deep connections between the geometric Langlands correspondence and topologically twisted super Yang-Mills theory.




Moreover, since various observables in supersymmetric QFTs are easier to compute than in non-supersymmetric theories, supersymmetric quantum field theory is being used to approximate certain aspects of other QFTs. For instance certain correlators in ordinary Yang-Mills theory coupled to spinors in Yang-Mills theory can be computed using an auxiliary super Yang-Mills theory.
Therefore, if nothing else, supersymmetric quantum field theories constitute a part of the whole space of quantum field theories which is useful for understanding general properties of that space. What is however still missing is any experimental evidence that the world is fundamentally described by a supersymmetric quantum field theory.

(Shnider 88, also Nahm 78, see Minwalla 98, section 4.2)

There exists no superconformal extension of the super Poincaré Lie algebra in dimension d>6d \gt 6.

This is due to (Shnider 88, Nahm 78). Review is in (Minwalla 98, section 4.2). For discussion in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence see also Blencowe & Duff 1988, Duff 2009, Duff 2021 and see the references at super p-brane – As part of the AdS-CFT correspondence.

Proof (sketch)
By realizing the conformal real Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(ℝ d,2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{R}^{d,2}) as a real section of the complexified 𝔰𝔬(ℂ d+2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2}) one is reduced to finding those (finite dimensional) simple super Lie algebras over the complex numbers whose even-graded part extends 𝔰𝔬(ℂ d+2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2}) and such that the implied representation of that on the odd-graded part contains the spin representation.
The complex finite dimensional simple super Lie algebras have been classified, see at super Lie algebra – Classification. By the tables shown there

the only manifest spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(2k+1)=B k\mathfrak{so}(2k+1) = B_k or of 𝔰𝔬(2k)=D k\mathfrak{so}(2k) = D_k appears in the exceptional super Lie algebra F(4)F(4), which contains B 3=𝔰𝔬(7)B_3 = \mathfrak{so}(7) in its even parts acting spinorially on its odd part. This hence gives a superconformal super Lie algebra in dimension 7−2=57-2 = 5, as shown in the proposition.
But other spinor representations may still disguise as vector representations of other Lie algebras under one of the exceptional isomorphisms. These exist only in low dimensions, and hence to conclude the proof it is sufficient to just list all candidates.
First there is the exceptional isomorphism
𝔰𝔬(5)≃𝔰𝔭(2)=C 2
  \mathfrak{so}(5) \simeq \mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2


with the spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(5)\mathfrak{so}(5) being the vector representation of 𝔰𝔭(2)=C 2\mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2. This we find in the above tables as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of B(m,2)B(m,2) and of D(m,2)D(m,2). Hence these are superconformal super Lie algebras in dimension 5−2=35-2 = 3, as shown in the statement.
The other exceptional isomorphism of relevance is
𝔰𝔬(6)≃𝔰𝔲(4)=A 3
  \mathfrak{so}(6)\simeq \mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3


with the spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(6)\mathfrak{so}(6) being the vector representation of 𝔰𝔲(4)=A 3\mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3. By the above tables this appears as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of the super Lie algebra A(3,k)A(3,k), and so this is the superconformal algebra in dimension 6−2=46-2 = 4.
Finally by triality the vector representation of 𝔰𝔬(8)=D 4\mathfrak{so}(8) = D_4 is isomorphic to its spinor representation. By the above tables this means that D(4,k)D(4,k) is a superconformal algebra in dimension 8−2=68-2 = 6. For details on this see (Shnider 88, last paragraphs)


Remark
Further constraints follow from requiring super-unitary representations (Minwalla 98, section 4.3). This restricts for instance the 6d superconformal algebra to D(4,1)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(8|2)D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8|2) and D(4,1)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(8,4)D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8,4), the latter being (over the reals as 𝔰𝔬(8 *|4)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(6,2|4)\mathfrak{so}(8^\ast|4) = \mathfrak{osp}(6,2|4)) the symmetry algebra of the 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT on the worldvolume of the M5-brane.

Extensions
In special dimensions supersymmetry super Lie algebras have polyvector extensions by brane charges, called for instance the type II supersymmetry algebra for the case of type II supergravity or the M-theory supersymmetry algebra for the case of 11-dimensional supergravity. These in turn are the truncations of super L-infinity algebra extensions, related to the supergravity Lie 3-algebra, supergravity Lie 6-algebra etc. See also at extended supersymmetry and extended super Minkowski spacetime.
Where generally a symmetry is an invariance under a group action (after all the mathematical term “group” is a contraction of group of symmetries), or, infinitesimally, an invariance under a Lie algebra action, in the general sense of the word, a supersymmetry is invariance under a supergroup action or a super Lie algebra action.

Morse theory of a Riemannian manifold can naturally be understood in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for superparticles propagating on that manifold;


the interpretation of quantum field theories in terms of generalized cohomology theories only works for supersymmetric theories (see (1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory and (2,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theory)


“topological twists” of supersymmetric field theories are a major source of examples of TQFTs, for instance the A-model and the B-model TCFT arise from such twists of 2-dimensional supergravity and there are deep connections between the geometric Langlands correspondence and topologically twisted super Yang-Mills theory.




Moreover, since various observables in supersymmetric QFTs are easier to compute than in non-supersymmetric theories, supersymmetric quantum field theory is being used to approximate certain aspects of other QFTs. For instance certain correlators in ordinary Yang-Mills theory coupled to spinors in Yang-Mills theory can be computed using an auxiliary super Yang-Mills theory.
Therefore, if nothing else, supersymmetric quantum field theories constitute a part of the whole space of quantum field theories which is useful for understanding general properties of that space. What is however still missing is any experimental evidence that the world is fundamentally described by a supersymmetric quantum field theory.

super Poincaré Lie algebras exist for every real spinor representation. See there for more. These come naturally equipped with a symmetric equivariant bilinear pairing of two spinors to a vector, and this constitutes the odd-odd bracket in the super Poincaré Lie algebra.

(Shnider 88, also Nahm 78, see Minwalla 98, section 4.2)

There exists no superconformal extension of the super Poincaré Lie algebra in dimension d>6d \gt 6.

This is due to (Shnider 88, Nahm 78). Review is in (Minwalla 98, section 4.2). For discussion in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence see also Blencowe & Duff 1988, Duff 2009, Duff 2021 and see the references at super p-brane – As part of the AdS-CFT correspondence.

Proof (sketch)
By realizing the conformal real Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(ℝ d,2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{R}^{d,2}) as a real section of the complexified 𝔰𝔬(ℂ d+2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2}) one is reduced to finding those (finite dimensional) simple super Lie algebras over the complex numbers whose even-graded part extends 𝔰𝔬(ℂ d+2)\mathfrak{so}(\mathbb{C}^{d+2}) and such that the implied representation of that on the odd-graded part contains the spin representation.
The complex finite dimensional simple super Lie algebras have been classified, see at super Lie algebra – Classification. By the tables shown there
𝔤\mathfrak{g}𝔤 even\mathfrak{g}_{even}𝔤 even\mathfrak{g}_{even} rep on 𝔤 odd\mathfrak{g}_{odd}B(m,n)B(m,n)B m⊕C nB_m \oplus C_nvector ⊗\otimes vector

C(n)C(n)ℂ −1⊕ℂ\mathbb{C}_{-1} \oplus \mathbb{C}vector ⊗\otimes ℂ\mathbb{C}

the only manifest spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(2k+1)=B k\mathfrak{so}(2k+1) = B_k or of 𝔰𝔬(2k)=D k\mathfrak{so}(2k) = D_k appears in the exceptional super Lie algebra F(4)F(4), which contains B 3=𝔰𝔬(7)B_3 = \mathfrak{so}(7) in its even parts acting spinorially on its odd part. This hence gives a superconformal super Lie algebra in dimension 7−2=57-2 = 5, as shown in the proposition.
But other spinor representations may still disguise as vector representations of other Lie algebras under one of the exceptional isomorphisms. These exist only in low dimensions, and hence to conclude the proof it is sufficient to just list all candidates.
First there is the exceptional isomorphism
𝔰𝔬(5)≃𝔰𝔭(2)=C 2
  \mathfrak{so}(5) \simeq \mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2


with the spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(5)\mathfrak{so}(5) being the vector representation of 𝔰𝔭(2)=C 2\mathfrak{sp}(2) = C_2. This we find in the above tables as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of B(m,2)B(m,2) and of D(m,2)D(m,2). Hence these are superconformal super Lie algebras in dimension 5−2=35-2 = 3, as shown in the statement.
The other exceptional isomorphism of relevance is
𝔰𝔬(6)≃𝔰𝔲(4)=A 3
  \mathfrak{so}(6)\simeq \mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3


with the spinor representation of 𝔰𝔬(6)\mathfrak{so}(6) being the vector representation of 𝔰𝔲(4)=A 3\mathfrak{su}(4) = A_3. By the above tables this appears as a summand in the even-graded subalgebra of the super Lie algebra A(3,k)A(3,k), and so this is the superconformal algebra in dimension 6−2=46-2 = 4.
Finally by triality the vector representation of 𝔰𝔬(8)=D 4\mathfrak{so}(8) = D_4 is isomorphic to its spinor representation. By the above tables this means that D(4,k)D(4,k) is a superconformal algebra in dimension 8−2=68-2 = 6. For details on this see (Shnider 88, last paragraphs)


Remark
Further constraints follow from requiring super-unitary representations (Minwalla 98, section 4.3). This restricts for instance the 6d superconformal algebra to D(4,1)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(8|2)D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8|2) and D(4,1)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(8,4)D(4,1) = \mathfrak{osp}(8,4), the latter being (over the reals as 𝔰𝔬(8 *|4)=𝔬𝔰𝔭(6,2|4)\mathfrak{so}(8^\ast|4) = \mathfrak{osp}(6,2|4)) the symmetry algebra of the 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT on the worldvolume of the M5-brane.

Extensions
In special dimensions supersymmetry super Lie algebras have polyvector extensions by brane charges, called for instance the type II supersymmetry algebra for the case of type II supergravity or the M-theory supersymmetry algebra for the case of 11-dimensional supergravity. These in turn are the truncations of super L-infinity algebra extensions, related to the supergravity Lie 3-algebra, supergravity Lie 6-algebra etc. See also at extended supersymmetry and extended super Minkowski spacetime.
General idea
In generality, homotopy theory is the study of mathematical contexts in which functions or rather (homo-)morphisms are equipped with a concept of homotopy between them, hence with a concept of “equivalent deformations” of morphisms,



and then iteratively with homotopies of homotopies between those:



and so forth.
A key aspect here is that in such homotopy theoretic contexts the concept of isomorphism is relaxed to that of homotopy equivalence: Where a morphism is regarded as invertible if there is a reverse function such that both composites are equal to the identity morphism, for a homotopy equivalence one only requires the composites to be homotopic to the identity. Regarding objects in a homotopical context up to homotopy equivalence this way is to regard them as homotopy types.
It is not wrong to summarize this by saying that:

Homotopy theory embodies the gauge principle in mathematics.

Namely, in physics, the gauge principle says that it is wrong to ask for any two things to be equal, instead one always has to ask whether there is a gauge transformation relating them, and then a gauge-of-gauge transformation relating these, etc. Similarly in homotopy theory it is wrong to ask whether any two objects are equal, instead one has to ask whether there is a homotopy equivalence between them and then higher homotopies between these, etc.

For more exposition on the general idea of homotopy theory see:

Higher Structures


Topological homotopy theory



The archetypical example of a homotopy theory is the classical homotopy theory of topological spaces, where one considers topological spaces with continuous functions between them, and with the original concept of topological homotopies between these continuous functions.
The category whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence-class of continuous functions is also called the classical homotopy category.
Classical constructions in topological homotopy theory are homotopy groups, Toda brackets, long exact sequences of homotopy groups, …
This classical homotopy theory of topological spaces has many applications, for example to covering space theory, to classifying space theory, to Whitehead-generalized cohomology theory and many more. (See also at shape theory.) Accordingly, homotopy theory has a large overlap with algebraic topology.

For more exposition of topological homotopy theory see:

Introduction to Basic Homotopy Theory


Abstract homotopy theory
The basic structures seen in classical homotopy theory of topological spaces may be abstracted to yield an “abstract homotopy theory” that applies to a large variety of contexts. There are several more or less equivalent formalizations of the concept of “abstract homotopy theory”, including


model categories


(∞,1)-categories


homotopy type theories.


higher observational type theories.


The terminology model category is short for “category of models of homotopy types”. The idea here is to consider categories equipped with suitable extra structure and properties that encodes the existence of homotopies between all morphisms and convenient means to handle and control these, in particular a means to construct the corresonding homotopy category.

For a detailed introduction to abstract homotopy theory via model cateories see:


Introduction to Homotopy Theory,


geometry of physics – homotopy types.



The approach of (∞,1)-categories to homotopy theory is meant to be more truthful to the intrinsic nature of homotopy theory. Instead of equipping an ordinary category with a extra concept of homotopy between its morphisms, here one regards the resulting structure as a higher category where the homotopies themselves appear as a kind of higher order morphisms, called 2-morphisms and where higher homotopies of homotopies are regarded as k-morphisms for all kk.
The terminology “(∞,1)-category” signifies that homotopy theory is but one special case of general higher category theory, namely (∞,1)-categories (hence homotopy theories) are those infinity-categories in which all k-morphisms for k>1k \gt 1 are invertible up to homotopy. If one drops this constraint, so that homotopies become “directed” then one might still speak of “directed homotopy theory”.
The archetypical example of an (∞,1)-category is the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category ∞Grpd of ∞-groupoids, just as Set is the archetypical 1-category.
This turns out to be equivalent, as homotopy theories, to the classical homotopy theory of topological spaces if restricted to those that admit the structure of CW-complexes.

Relation between topological and abstract homotopy theory: Cohesion.
The case of the homotopy theory of topological spaces (above) is so classical that often the distinction between topology and homotopy theory has been (certainly so in the early literature) and still is often blurred (for instance in textbook titles or lecture notes). A transparent conceptual way to understand how topology and homotopy theory are closely related and yet different is provided by the notion of cohesion:
A topological space XX has (or presents) a homotopy type through the data that is retained in its path ∞-groupoid, conveniently modeled by its singular simplicial set Sing(X)Sing(X) (which is a Kan complex and as such an ∞-groupoid). But the topological space contains more information than that retained in its path ∞-groupoid – the latter is just a shadow of it, called the shape of the topological space.
The extra information in a topological space is the cohesion on its underlying set of points: The geometric information of how these points stick together within open subsets. This information is lost when one regards topological spaces as stand-ins for their shapes (path ∞-groupoids) in plain homotopy theory.
More formally:
The category of D-topological spaces is a full subcategory of the cohesive 


(

)

(\infty,1)

-topos of D-topological 


∞

\infty

-groupoids (also of smooth 


∞

\infty

-groupoids). These carry a qualitative aspect called their shape, which is a generalization of the fundamental ∞-groupoid-construction. Now, regarding a topological space as an object in (plain) homotopy theory, as traditionally done, really means to first regard it as a topological groupoid in cohesive homotopy theory and then, as such, to retain only its shape. The result is the homotopy type which is “presented” by the topological space:




Simplicial homotopy theory
The most immediate way model an ∞-groupoid is as a simplicial set which is a Kan complex. Accordingly, another homotopy theory equivalent to archetypical homotopy theory of ∞-groupoids is the classical homotopy theory of simplicial sets, typically referred to as simplicial homotopy theory.

Flavors of homotopy theory
But there are many other homotopy theories besides (the various incarnations of) this classical one. Important sub-classes of homotopy theories include:


stable homotopy theory modeled by stable model categories and stable (∞,1)-categories, where the operations of looping and delooping are an equivalence. This includes the stable (∞,1)-category of spectra as well as those of sheaves of spectra.


geometric homotopy theory modeled by model toposes and (∞,1)-toposes, which are the homotopy theoretic analogs of ordinary toposes. This includes the homotopy theoretic analog of categories of sheaves, called (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves or of ∞-stacks, but it potentially also contains “elementary (∞,1)-toposes”.


The geometric homotopy theory of (∞,1)-toposes in particular serves as the foundation for higher geometry/derived geometry. This is relevant notably in the physics of gauge theory, where gauge transformations are identified with homotopies in geometric homotopy theory. For more on this see at geometry of physics – homotopy types.
On the other hand, the incarnation of homotopy theory as homotopy type theory exhibits the remarkably foundational nature of homotopy theory. Contrary to its original appearance as a fairly complicated-looking theory built on top of classical set theory and classical topology, homotopy theory turns out to be intrinsically simple: it arises from plain dependent type theory just by adopting a fully constructive attitude towards the concept of identity/equality, see at identity type for more on this. For exposition of this perspective see (Shulman 17).

It is common in informal language to speak of mathematical objects “equipped with extra structure” of some sort. The archetypical examples are algebras over a Lawvere theory in Set: these are sets equipped with the structure of certain algebraic operations. For instance a group (G,e,⋅)(G, e, {\cdot}) is a set GG equipped with a binary operation ⋅:G×G→G{\cdot} : G \times G \to G, etc.
One may formalize the notion of structure using the language of category theory. This is discussed at stuff, structure, property. In that formalization objects in some category DD are objects in some category CC equipped with extra structure if there is a functor p:D→Cp \colon D \to C such that

pp is a faithful functor.

 Depending on author and situation, more properties are required of this functor (Ehresmann 57, Ehresmann 65, Adamek-Rosicky-Vitale 09, remark 13.18):


pp is an amnestic functor (pp-vertical isomorphisms are identities),


pp is an isofibration (isomorphisms can be lifted along pp).


 However, notice that these two conditions violate the principle of equivalence for categories. In the terminology of strict categories one might hence refer to these conditions as expressing “strict extra structure”.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
Given a Lagrangian field theory with field bundle E→fbΣE \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma over spacetime Σ\Sigma, then a field history is a smooth section of this field bundle Φ∈Γ Σ(E)\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E).
For every Cauchy surface Σ p↪Σ\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma the restriction Φ| Σ p\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p} of Φ\Phi to Σ p\Sigma_p may be thought of as the field configuration “at that time” and hence the change of Φ| Σ p\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p} as the choice of Cauchy surface changes reflects the “history” of these configurations, whence the name.
For a sigma model field theory a field history may be thought of as a trajectory.
For more see at geometry of physics – perturbative quantum field theory the chapter Fields.
There is a lot of interesting stuff to be said about equality in logic, higher category theory, and the foundations of mathematics, but it hasn't all been said here yet.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
In many categories CC in which one does homotopy theory, there is a notion of homotopy between morphisms, which is closely related to the 2-morphisms in higher category theory: a homotopy between two morphisms is a way in which they are equivalent.
If we regard such a category as a presentation of an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category, then homotopies f∼gf\sim g present the 2-cells f⇒gf\Rightarrow g in the resulting (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category.

Example
Let XX be a topological space and let x,y∈Xx,y \in X be two of its points, regarded as functions x,y:*⟶Xx,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X from the point to XX. Then a left homotopy, def. , between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form
*  δ 0↓ ↘ x I ⟶η X  δ 1↑ ↗ y *.
  \array{
     \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
     \\
     I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{y}}
     \\
     \ast
  }
  \,.


This is simply a continuous path in XX whose endpoints are xx and yy.

In enriched categories
If CC is enriched over Top, then a homotopy in CC between maps f,g:X⇉Yf,g:X\,\rightrightarrows \,Y is a map H:[0,1]→C(X,Y)H:[0,1] \to C(X,Y) in TopTop such that H(0)=fH(0)=f and H(1)=gH(1)=g. In TopTop itself this is the classical notion.
If CC has copowers, then an equivalent definition is a map [0,1]⊙X→Y[0,1]\odot X\to Y, while if it has powers, an equivalent definition is a map X→⋔([0,1],Y)X\to \pitchfork([0,1],Y).
There is a similar definition in a simplicially enriched category, replacing [0,1][0,1] with the 1-simplex Δ 1\Delta^1, with the caveat that in this case not all simplicial homotopies need be composable even if they match correctly. (This depends on whether or not all (2,1)-horns in the simplicial set, C(X,Y)C(X,Y), have fillers.) Likewise in a dg-category we can use the “chain complex interval” to get a notion of chain homotopy.
In model categories
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a model category, it has an intrinsic notion of homotopy determined by its factorizations. For more on the following see at homotopy in a model category.

Definition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a model category and X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object.

A path object Path(X)Path(X) for XX is a factorization of the diagonal ∇ X:X→X×X\nabla_X \colon X \to X \times X as

∇ X:X⟶∈WiPath(X)⟶(p 0,p 1)X×X.
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
   X \underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow} Path(X) \overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.


where X→Path(X)X\to Path(X) is a weak equivalence. This is called a good path object if in addition Path(X)→X×XPath(X) \to X \times X is a fibration.

A cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) for XX is a factorization of the codiagonal (or “fold map”) Δ X:X⊔X→X\Delta_X: X \sqcup X \to X as

Δ X:X⊔X⟶(i 0,i 1)Cyl(X)⟶p∈WX.
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \underoverset{p}{\in W}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.


where Cyl(X)→XCyl(X) \to X is a weak equivalence. This is called a good cylinder object if in addition X⊔X→Cyl(X)X \sqcup X \to Cyl(X) is a cofibration.


Remark
By the factorization axioms every object in a model category has both a good path object and as well as a good cylinder object according to def. . But in some situations one is genuinely interested in using non-good such objects.
For instance in the classical model structure on topological spaces, the obvious object X×[0,1]X\times [0,1] is a cylinder object, but not a good cylinder unless XX itself is cofibrant (a cell complex in this case).
More generally, the path object Path(X)Path(X) of def.  is analogous to the powering ⋔(I,X)\pitchfork(I,X) with an interval object and the cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) is analogous to the tensoring I⊙XI\odot X with an interval object. In fact, if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a VV-enriched model category and XX is fibrant/cofibrant, then these powers and copowers are in fact examples of (good) path and cylinder objects if the interval object is sufficiently good.


Definition
Let f,g:X⟶Yf,g \colon X \longrightarrow Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.

A left homotopy η:f⇒ Lg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_L g is a morphism η:Cyl(X)⟶Y\eta \colon Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y from a cylinder object of XX, def. , such that it makes this diagram commute:

X ⟶ Cyl(X) ⟵ X   f↘ ↓ η ↙ g   Y.
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& Cyl(X) &\longleftarrow& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow &\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    && 
    Y
  }
  \,.



A right homotopy η:f⇒ Rg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_R g is a morphism η:X→Path(Y)\eta \colon X \to Path(Y) to some path object of XX, def. , such that this diagram commutes:

  X   f↙ ↓ η ↘ g Y ⟵ Path(Y) ⟶ Y.
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} 
    \\
    Y &\longleftarrow& Path(Y) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.



Remark
By remark  it follows that in a TopTop-enriched model category, any enriched homotopy between maps X→YX\to Y is a left homotopy if XX is cofibrant and a right homotopy if YY is fibrant. Similar remarks hold for other enrichments.

For more see at homotopy in a model category.
In (co-)fibration categories
Clearly the concept of left homotopy in def.  only needs part of the model category axioms and thus makes sense more generally in suitable cofibration categories. Dually, the concept of path objects in def.  makes sense more generally in suitable fibration categories such as categories of fibrant objects in the sense of Brown.
Likewise if there is a cylinder functor, one gets functorially defined cylinder objects, etc.
In dependent type theory
In dependent type theory, let AA be a type and let PP be a type family indexed by AA, and let f,g:∏ x:AP(x)f,g:\prod_{x:A} P(x) be two elements of a dependent product type of a type family PP. The type of homotopies between ff and gg is the type
f∼g≡∏ x:A(f(x)= B(x)g(x))f \sim g \equiv \prod_{x:A} (f(x) =_{B(x)} g(x))
A homotopy between ff and gg is simply an element H:f∼gH:f \sim g.
Note that a homotopy is not the same as an identification f=gf = g. However this can be made so if one assumes function extensionality.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
In gauge theory two configurations ϕ 1,ϕ 2\phi_1, \phi_2 of gauge fields may be different and still be equivalent: there may be a gauge transformation λ:ϕ 1→ϕ 2\lambda \colon \phi_1 \to \phi_2 between them.
In higher gauge theory also gauge transformations themseves may be different but still equivalent: if there is a gauge-of-gauge transformation ρ:λ 1→λ 2\rho \colon \lambda_1 \to \lambda_2 between them.
These higher order gauge transformations are maybe best known in the physics literature in terms of their infinitesimal approximation, the BRST complex: here the gauge transformations correspond to ghost fields and the gauge-of-gauge transformations to ghost-of-ghost fields.

-types of higher nn.
Traditionally, a homotopy type is a topological space regarded up to weak homotopy equivalence, (although this may sometimes be referred to as its weak homotopy type, (see below)). Formally this may be taken to mean the object that XX represents in the standard homotopy category Ho(Top), or, better, in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd ≃\simeq L wheTopL_{whe} Top, the simplicial localization of the category Top at the weak homotopy equivalences, of which Ho(Top)Ho(Top) is the decategorification. As such, topological spaces regarded as homotopy types are equivalently ∞-groupoids (see at homotopy hypothesis for more on this).
More generally, then, we may think of every object in any (∞,1)-topos 𝒞\mathcal{C} as being a homotopy type in the world of 𝒞\mathcal{C} (just as we may think of an object of a 1-topos 𝒮\mathcal{S} as being a “set in the world of 𝒮\mathcal{S}”). For instance, if 𝒞=Sh ∞(C)\mathcal{C} = Sh_\infty(C) is an (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves/of ∞-stacks over some (∞,1)-site CC, then an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be thought of as a homotopy type over CC, or a sheaf of homotopy types. If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is the classifying topos of some geometric theory TT, then an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be called a “TT-structured homotopy type”. And if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos, an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be called a “cohesive homotopy type”. In the special case that 𝒞=Sh ∞(*)≃∞Gprd\mathcal{C} = Sh_\infty(*) \simeq \infty Gprd, this reproduces the traditional notion.
The reason this makes sense is that any (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos has an internal language, which is homotopy type theory — a formal logic whose basic objects are abstract things called homotopy types, just as the basic objects of set theory are abstract things called sets. Inside the internal logic of 𝒞\mathcal{C}, its objects behave like classical homotopy types (although the ambient logic is constructive). This explains why we can think of objects of 𝒞\mathcal{C} as “homotopy types in the world of 𝒞\mathcal{C}”: they are the categorical semantics of these abstract homotopy types in the internal logic of 𝒞\mathcal{C}. In the special case of ∞Grpd\infty Grpd, the internal and external logic are the same, so this meaning also includes the classical usage of “homotopy type”.
Homotopy nn-types
A homotopy type that is an n-truncated object in an (∞,1)-category or equivalently that interprets a type of homotopy level n+2n+2 is also called a homotopy n-type or nn-type for short. For topological spaces / ∞-groupoids this means that all homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Higher geometry or homotopical geometry is the study of concepts of space and geometry in the context of higher category theory and homotopy theory.

Slogan
higher geometry = geometry + homotopy theory/higher category theory

Higher geometry subsumes notably the theory of orbifolds and geometric stacks, as well as the theory of more general stacks such as moduli stacks, and generalizes all this to ∞-stacks and derived stacks. This way higher geometry includes what is called derived geometry and it subsumes at least parts of (derived) noncommutative geometry. Many other phenomena are naturally part of higher geometry, see the list of Examples below.
In any given instance of higher geometry, one starts with a notion of “local models” for the geometry. An affine space will then be a formal dual of such a local model, and a general space will be formed by “gluing” these affine spaces in some appropriate way. There are two ways of formalizing this idea, coming from Alexander Grothendieck‘s two definitions of scheme in algebraic geometry via locally ringed spaces and functors of points. Both are built on (∞,1)-topos theory: in one direction, a petit (∞,1)-topos (with some additional structure) encodes a space itself; in another direction, a space is an object of a gros (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks on some (∞,1)-site. We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
These approaches do not apply to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which requires a different approach to deal with a more complicated notion of gluing; we discuss this below in Noncommutative algebraic geometry.

Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
For more see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Supergeometry may defined over an arbitrary commutative ring (Schwarz and Shapiro 06).
The term ‘space’ is quite generic and can mean many different things depending on context. Often we will link it because we want to include many of these contexts at once!
Probably the default spaces are topological spaces (as defined by Bourbaki), with continuous maps between them. There are many variants, from convergence spaces (general) to metric (metrisable) spaces (specific), all of which fall under the topic of topology. An important variation gives locales; many of the theorems from topology that require the axiom of choice for Bourbaki spaces become constructively valid for locales.
Often one restricts to nice topological spaces or to a nice category of spaces; these are not always the same kind of restriction! There are many examples under those two headings; m-cofibrant spaces in particular allow one to identify homotopy equivalence with weak homotopy equivalence. More generally in homotopy theory, one uses the homotopy hypothesis to identify spaces with ∞\infty-groupoids, of which there are several models. Since one common model is simplicial sets, some homotopy theorists use “space” to mean “simplicial set.”
Often one is also interested in spaces with additional structure. For instance, smooth manifolds and generalized smooth spaces are spaces with smooth structure, and algebraic varieties and schemes are spaces with algebraic structure. One can also speak more generally of spaces “modeled” on any suitable starting category; in this way one often comes to consider sheaves on a suitable site (and variations such as presheaves, copresheaves, or objects of an Isbell envelope) as spaces. Generalized smooth spaces and schemes are two commonly encountered examples of spaces “modeled” on a starting category in this way.
One can also categorify the concept of space. As space is dual to quantity, space and quantity can be categorified together; see ∞\infty-space and compare ∞\infty-quantity. Other types of categorified spaces include Grothendieck toposes (which are categorified locales) and stacks (which are categorified sheaves) and even their ∞\infty-versions ((∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes and ∞\infty-stacks).
The notion of topological space aims to axiomatize the idea of a space as a collection of points that hang together (“cohere”) in a continuous way. Roughly speaking, a topology on a set “of points” prescribes which subsets are to be considered “neighborhoods” of the points they contain. Various conditions or axioms must be satisfied in order for such neighborhood systems to form a topology, but one of the most important is that for any two neighborhoods of a point, their intersection must also be a neighborhood of that point.
Many notions of spaces used in mathematics have underlying topological spaces, such as: manifolds, schemes, probability spaces, etc.
The concept of a topology, gradually refined over the latter half of the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th, was developed to capture what it means abstractly for a mapping between sets of points to be “continuous”. Intuitively, the idea of bending, twisting or crumpling a continuous body applies to continuous mappings, because they preserve neighborhood relations (in a suitable sense), but tearing, for instance, does not.
For example, the surface of a torus or doughnut is topologically equivalent to the surface of a mug: the surface of the mug can be deformed continuously into the surface of a torus. Abstractly speaking: the continuous cohesion among the collections of points of the two surfaces is the same. Similarly, a circle and a square are considered equivalent from the standpoint of their topologies.
Some one-dimensional shapes with different topologies: the Mercedes-Benz symbol, a line, a circle, a complete graph with 5 nodes, the skeleton of a cube, and an asterisk (or, if you’ll permit the one-dimensional approximation, a starfish). On the other hand, a circle has the same topology as a line segment with a wormhole at its finish which teleports you to its start; or more prosaically: The circle is homeomorphic to the closed interval with endpoints identified.
There is a generalization of the notion of topological spaces to that of locales, which consists of dropping the assumption that all neighbourhoods are explicitly or even necessarily supported by points. For this reason, the theory of locales is sometimes called “pointless topology”. In this form, the definition turns out to be quite fundamental and can be naturally motivated from just pure logic – as the formal dual of frames – as well as, and dually, from category theory in its variant as topos theory – by the notion of (0,1)-toposes.
Topological spaces are the objects studied in topology. But types of topological spaces exist in such great and wild profusion that in practice it is often more convenient to replace strict topological equivalence by a notion of weak equivalence, namely of weak homotopy equivalence. From this point of view, topological spaces support also homotopy theory.
Topological spaces equipped with extra properties and structure form the fundament of much of geometry. For instance a topological space locally isomorphic to a Cartesian space is a manifold. A topological space equipped with a notion of smooth functions into it is a diffeological space. The intersection of these two notions is that of a smooth manifold on which differential geometry is based. And so on.
A differentiable manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space (a topological manifold) and such that the gluing functions which relate these Euclidean local charts to each other are differentiable functions, for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity then one speaks of smooth manifolds and if one demands analytic gluing functions then one speaks of analytic manifolds. For a general discussion see at manifold.
Accordingly, a differentiable manifold is a space to which the tools of (infinitesimal) analysis may be applied locally. Notably we may ask whether a continuous function between differentiable manifolds is differentiable by computing its derivatives pointwise in any of the Euclidean coordinate charts.
In particular one may consider smooth functions from the real line into any smooth manifold XX, “smooth curves” in XX. The equivalence classes of these that have the same first derivative at a given point capture the idea of “infinitsimal smooth paths” through that point in the manifold, called its tangent vectors. All the tangent vectors at one point x∈Xx \in X constitute the tangent space T xXT_x X, and the collection of all these tangent spaces yields another differentiable manifold, called the tangent bundle TXT X. This happens to be a vector bundle which is associated to a principal bundle, called the frame bundle Fr(X)Fr(X).
By equipping the tangent bundle or frame bundle of a differentiable manifold with extra properties or extra structure one encodes geometry on the manifold. For example equipping them with orthogonal structure encodes Riemannian geometry on manifolds. More generally one may consider any G-structure on the frame bundle and thereby equip the manifold with the corresponding Cartan geometry, for instance complex geometry, conformal geometry etc.
This way differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for differential geometry. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry. In fact both of these concepts are unified within synthetic differential geometry.
If one relaxes the condition on differentiable manifold from it being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to it just admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the more general concept of diffeological spaces or even smooth sets, see at generalized smooth space for more on this. If one generalizes here differentiable functions to simplicial differentiable functions one obtains concepts of derived smooth manifold.
The generalization of differentiable manifolds to higher differential geometry are orbifolds and more generally differentiable stacks. If one combines this with the generalization to smooth sets then one obtains the concept of smooth stacks and eventually smooth infinity-stacks.
For convenience, we first recall the basic definition of

Topological manifolds

and of

Differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces

and then turn to the actual definition of

Differentiable manifolds.

Topological manifolds
For convenience, we first recall here some background on topological manifolds:

Definition
(topological manifold)
A topological manifold is a topological space which is


locally Euclidean,


paracompact Hausdorff.


If the local Euclidean neighbourhoods ℝ n→≃U⊂X\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\simeq}{\to} U \subset X are all of dimension nn for a fixed n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, then the topological manifold is said to be a nn-dimensional manifold or nn-fold. This is usually assumed to be the case.


Remark
(varying terminology)
Often a topological manifold (def. ) is required to be sigma-compact. But by this prop. this is not an extra condition as long as there is a countable set of connected components. Moreover, manifolds with uncountably many connected components are rarely considered in practice.


Definition
(local chart, atlas and gluing function)
Given an nn-dimensional topological manifold XX (def. ), then





an open subset U⊂XU \subset X and a homeomorphism ϕ:ℝ n→A≃AU\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phantom{A}\simeq\phantom{A}}{\to} U is also called a local coordinate chart of XX.


an open cover of XX by local charts {ℝ n→ϕ iU⊂X} i∈I\left\{ \mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U \subset X \right\}_{i \in I} is called an atlas of the topological manifold.


denoting for each i,j∈Ii,j \in I the intersection of the iith chart with the jjth chart in such an atlas by
U ij≔U i∩U j
  U_{i j} \coloneqq U_i \cap U_j


then the induced homeomorphism
ℝ n⊃AAϕ i −1(U ij)⟶Aϕ iAU ij⟶Aϕ j −1Aϕ j −1(U ij)AA⊂ℝ n
  \mathbb{R}^n
    \supset
     \phantom{AA}
  \phi_i^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_i\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  U_{i j}
    \overset{\phantom{A}\phi_j^{-1}\phantom{A}}{\longrightarrow}
  \phi_j^{-1}(U_{i j})
    \phantom{AA}
    \subset
  \mathbb{R}^n


is called the gluing function from chart ii to chart jj.

Differentiable functions between Cartesian spaces
For convenience we recall the definition of differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces.

Definition
(differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces)
Let n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and let U⊂ℝ nU \subset \mathbb{R}^n be an open subset.
Then a function f:U⟶ℝf \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} is called differentiable at x∈Ux\in U if there exists a linear map df x:ℝ n→ℝd f_x : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} such that the following limit exists as hh approaches zero “from all directions at once”:
lim h→0f(x+h)−f(x)−df x(h)‖h‖=0.
  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} = 0.


This means that for all ϵ∈(0,∞)\epsilon \in (0,\infty) there exists an open subset V⊆UV\subseteq U containing xx such that whenever x+h∈Vx+h\in V we have f(x+h)−f(x)−df x(h)‖h‖<ϵ\frac{f(x+h)-f(x) - d f_x(h)}{\Vert h\Vert} \lt \epsilon.
We say that ff is differentiable on a subset II of UU if ff is differentiable at every x∈Ix\in I, and differentiable if ff is differentiable on all of UU. We say that ff is continuously differentiable if it is differentiable and dfd f is a continuous function.
The map df xd f_x is called the derivative or differential of ff at xx.
More generally, let n 1,n 2∈ℕn_1, n_2 \in \mathbb{N} and let U⊆ℝ n 1U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1} be an open subset.
Then a function f:U⟶ℝ n 2f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_2} is differentiable if for all i∈{1,⋯,n 2}i \in \{1, \cdots, n_2\} the component function
f i:U⟶fℝ n 2⟶pr uℝ
  f_i \;\colon\; U \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^{n_2} \overset{pr_u}{\longrightarrow}  \mathbb{R}


is differentiable in the previous sense
In this case, the derivatives df i:ℝ n→ℝd f_i \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} of the f if_i assemble into a linear map of the form
df x:ℝ n 1→ℝ n 2.
  d f_x \;\colon\; \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
  \,.


If the derivative exists at each x∈Ux \in U, then it defines itself a function
df:U⟶Hom ℝ(ℝ n 1,ℝ n 2)≃ℝ n 1⋅n 2
  d f \;\colon\; U \longrightarrow Hom_{\mathbb{R}}(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} , \mathbb{R}^{n_2}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{n_1 \cdot n_2}


to the space of linear maps from ℝ n 1\mathbb{R}^{n_1} to ℝ n 2\mathbb{R}^{n_2}, which is canonically itself a Euclidean space. We say that ff is twice continuously differentiable if dfd f is continuously differentiable.
Generally then, for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} the function ff is called kk-fold continuously differentiable or of class C kC^k if the kk-fold differential d kfd^k f exists and is a continuous function.
Finally, if ff is kk-fold continuously differentiable for all k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} then it is called a smooth function or of class C ∞C^\infty.

Of the various properties satisfied by differentiation, the following plays a special role in the theory of differentiable manifolds (notably in the discussion of their tangent bundles):

Proposition
(chain rule for differentiable functions between Euclidean spaces)
Let n 1,n 2,n 3∈ℕn_1, n_2, n_3 \in \mathbb{N} and let
ℝ n 1⟶fℝ n 2⟶gℝ n 3
  \mathbb{R}^{n_1}
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_2}
    \overset{g}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbb{R}^{n_3}


be two differentiable functions (def. ). Then the derivative of their composite is the composite of their derivatives:
d(g∘f)=(dg)∘(df)
  d(g \circ f) = (d g) \circ (d f)


hence for all x∈ℝ n 1x \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1} we have
d(g∘f) x=dg f(x)∘df x.
  d(g \circ f)_x = d g_{f(x)} \circ d f_x
  \,.


Differentiable manifolds

Definition
(differentiable manifold and smooth manifold)
For p∈ℕ∪{∞}p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\} then a pp-fold differentiable manifold or C pC^p-manifold for short is


a topological manifold XX (def. );


an atlas {ℝ n→ϕ iX}\{\mathbb{R}^n \overset{\phi_i}{\to} X\} (def. ) all whose gluing functions are pp times continuously differentiable.


A pp-fold differentiable function between pp-fold differentiable manifolds
(X,{ℝ n→ϕ iU i⊂X} i∈I)⟶AAfAA(Y,{ℝ n′→ψ jV j⊂Y} j∈J)
  \left(X,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n} \overset{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\}_{i \in I} \right)
   \overset{\phantom{AA}f\phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(Y,\, \{\mathbb{R}^{n'} \overset{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}_{j \in J} \right)


is

a continuous function f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y

such that


for all i∈Ii \in I and j∈Jj \in J then
ℝ n⊃AA(f∘ϕ i) −1(V j)⟶ϕ if −1(V j)⟶fV j⟶ψ j −1ℝ n′
   \mathbb{R}^n
   \supset
    \phantom{AA}
   (f\circ \phi_i)^{-1}(V_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
   f^{-1}(V_j)
    \overset{f}{\longrightarrow}
   V_j
     \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow}
   \mathbb{R}^{n'}


is a pp-fold differentiable function between open subsets of Euclidean space.


(Notice that this in in general a non-trivial condition even if X=YX = Y and ff is the identity function. In this case the above exhibits a passage to a different, but equivalent, differentiable atlas.)
If a manifold is C pC^p differentiable for all pp, then it is called a smooth manifold. Accordingly a continuous function between differentiable manifolds which is pp-fold differentiable for all pp is called a smooth function,


Remark
(category Diff of differentiable manifolds)
In analogy to remark  there is a category called Diff p{}_p (or similar) whose objects are C pC^p-differentiable manifolds and whose morphisms are C pC^p-differentiable functions, for given p∈ℕ∪{∞}p \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}.

The analog of the concept of homeomorphism (def. ) is now this:

Definition
(diffeomorphism)
Given smooth manifolds XX and YY (def. ), then a smooth function
f:X⟶Y
  f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Y


is called a diffeomorphism, if there is an inverse function
X⟵Y:g
  X \longleftarrow Y \;\colon\; g


which is also a smooth function (hence if ff is an isomorphism in the category Diff ∞{}_\infty from remark ).

Here it is important to note that while being a topological manifold is just a property of a topological space, a differentiable manifold carries extra structure encoded in the atlas:

Definition
(smooth structure)
Let XX be a topological manifold (def. ) and let
(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈IAAAandAAA(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
  \right)_{i \in I}
  \phantom{AAA}
   \text{and}
  \phantom{AAA}
  \left(
    \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
  \right)_{j \in J}


be two atlases (def. ), both making XX into a smooth manifold (def. ).
Then there is a diffeomorphism (def. ) of the form
f:(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ϕ iU i⊂X) i∈I)⟶≃(X,(ℝ n⟶≃ψ jV j⊂X) j∈J)
  f
  \;\colon\;
  \left(
    X
      \;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^n \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} U_i \subset X
    \right)_{i \in I}
  \right)
    \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \left(
    X\;,\;
    \left(
      \mathbb{R}^{n} \underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\longrightarrow} V_j \subset X
    \right)_{j \in J}
  \right)


precisely if the identity function on the underlying set of XX constitutes such a diffeomorphism. (Because if ff is a diffeomorphism, then also f −1∘f=id Xf^{-1}\circ f = id_X is a diffeomorphism.)
That the identity function is a diffeomorphism between XX equipped with these two atlases means, by definition , that
∀i∈Ij∈J(ϕ i −1(V j)⟶ϕ iV j⟶ψ j −1ℝ nAAis smooth).
  \underset{{i \in I} \atop {j \in J}}{\forall}
  \left(
    \phi_i^{-1}(V_j) \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow} V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n
    \phantom{AA}
    \text{is smooth}
  \right)
  \,.


Notice that the functions on the right may equivalently be written as
ℝ n⊃ϕ i −1(U i∩U j)⟶ϕ iU i∩V j⟶ψ j −1ψ j −1(U i∩V j)⊂ℝ n
  \mathbb{R}^n \supset
   \,
   \phi_i^{-1}(U_i \cap U_j)
     \overset{\phi_i}{\longrightarrow}
    U_i \cap V_j \overset{\psi_j^{-1}}{\longrightarrow} \psi_j^{-1}(U_i \cap V_j) \; \subset \mathbb{R}^n


showing their analogy to the glueing functions within a single atlas spring.
Hence diffeomorphism induces an equivalence relation on the set of smooth atlases that exist on a given topological manifold XX. An equivalence class with respect to this equivalence relation is called a smooth structure on XX.


Example
(Cartesian space as a smooth manifold)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} then the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n equipped with the atlas consisting of the single chart ℝ n→idℝ n\mathbb{R}^n \overset{id}{\to} \mathbb{R}^n is a smooth manifold, in particularly a pp-fold differentiable manifold for every p∈ℕp \in \mathbb{N} according to def. .
Similarly the open disk D nD^n becomes a smooth manifold when equipped with the atlas whose single chart is the homeomorphism ℝ n→D n\mathbb{R}^n \to D^n.
This defines a smooth structure (def. ) on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and D nD^n. Strikingly, precisely for n=4n = 4 there are other smooth structures on ℝ 4\mathbb{R}^4, hence called exotic smooth structures.


Example
(n-spheres as smooth manifolds)
For all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the n-sphere S nS^n becomes a smooth manfold, with atlas consisting of the two local charts that are given by the inverse functions of the stereographic projection from the two poles of the sphere onto the equatorial hyperplane
{ℝ n⟶≃σ i −1S n} i∈{+,−}.
  \left\{
     \mathbb{R}^n
       \underoverset{\simeq}{\sigma^{-1}_i}{\longrightarrow}
     S^n
  \right\}_{i \in \{+,-\}}
  \,.


By the formulas given in this prop. the induced gluing function ℝ n\{0}→ℝ n\{0}\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{0\} is a rational function, and hence a smooth function.
Finally the nn-sphere is a paracompact Hausdorff topological space. Ways to see this include:


S n⊂ℝ n+1S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1} is a compact subspace by the Heine-Borel theorem. Compact spaces are evidently also paracompact. Moreover, Euclidean space, like any metric space, is Hausdorff, and subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff;


The nn-sphere has an evident structure of a CW-complex and CW-complexes are paracompact Hausdorff spaces.




Example
(real projective space and complex projective space)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}


the real projective space ℝP n\mathbb{R}P^n has the structure of a smooth manifold of dimension nn;


the complex projective space ℂP n\mathbb{C}P^n has the structure of a smooth manifold of (real) dimension 2n2n.


where in both cases the atlas is given by the standard open cover (this def.).

By this prop..
We now discuss some general mechanisms by which new differentiable manifolds arise from given ones:

Example
(product manifold)
Let XX any YY be two differentiable manifolds with atlases {ℝ n→≃ϕ iU i⊂X}\{\mathbb{R}^n\underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i}{\to} U_i \subset X\} and {ℝ n′→≃ψ jV j⊂Y}\{\mathbb{R}^{n'}\underoverset{\simeq}{\psi_j}{\to} V_j \subset Y\}. Then their product topological space X×YX \times Y becomes an differentiable manifold with respect to the atlas
{ℝ n⋅n′→≃ϕ i×ψ jU i×V j⊂X×Y} (i,j)∈I×J
  \left\{
    \mathbb{R}^{n \cdot n'}
      \underoverset{\simeq}{\phi_i \times \psi_j}{\to}
    U_i \times V_j
      \subset
    X \times Y
  \right\}_{(i,j) \in I \times J}



Example
(open subsets of differentiable manifolds are differentiable manifolds)
Let XX be a kk-fold differentiable manifold and let S⊂XS \subset X be an open subset of the underlying topological space (X,τ)(X,\tau).
Then SS carries the structure of a kk-fold differentiable manifold such that the inclusion map S↪XS \hookrightarrow X is an open embedding of differentiable manifolds.


Proof
Since the underlying topological space of XX is locally connected (this prop.) it is the disjoint union space of its connected components (this prop.).
Therefore we are reduced to showing the statement for the case that XX has a single connected component. By this prop this implies that XX is second-countable topological space.
Now a subspace of a second-countable Hausdorff space is clearly itself second countable and Hausdorff.
Similarly it is immediate that SS is still locally Euclidean: since XX is locally Euclidean every point x∈S⊂Xx \in S \subset X has a Euclidean neighbourhood in XX and since SS is open there exists an open ball in that (itself homeomorphic to Euclidean space) which is a Euclidean neighbourhood of xx contained in SS.
For the differentiable structure we pick these Euclidean neighbourhoods from the given atlas. Then the gluing functions for the Euclidean charts on SS are kk-fold differentiable follows since these are restrictions of the gluing functions for the atlas of XX.


Example
(general linear group)
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the general linear group Gl(n,ℝ)Gl(n,\mathbb{R}) is a smooth manifold (as an open subspace of Euclidean space GL(n,ℝ)⊂Mat n×n(ℝ)≃ℝ (n 2)GL(n,\mathbb{R}) \subset Mat_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R}) \simeq \mathbb{R}^{(n^2)}, via example  and example ).
The group operations are smooth functions with respect to this smooth manifold structure, and thus GL(n,ℝ)GL(n,\mathbb{R}) is a Lie group.

Higher geometry or homotopical geometry is the study of concepts of space and geometry in the context of higher category theory and homotopy theory.

Slogan
higher geometry = geometry + homotopy theory/higher category theory

Higher geometry subsumes notably the theory of orbifolds and geometric stacks, as well as the theory of more general stacks such as moduli stacks, and generalizes all this to ∞-stacks and derived stacks. This way higher geometry includes what is called derived geometry and it subsumes at least parts of (derived) noncommutative geometry. Many other phenomena are naturally part of higher geometry, see the list of Examples below.
In any given instance of higher geometry, one starts with a notion of “local models” for the geometry. An affine space will then be a formal dual of such a local model, and a general space will be formed by “gluing” these affine spaces in some appropriate way. There are two ways of formalizing this idea, coming from Alexander Grothendieck‘s two definitions of scheme in algebraic geometry via locally ringed spaces and functors of points. Both are built on (∞,1)-topos theory: in one direction, a petit (∞,1)-topos (with some additional structure) encodes a space itself; in another direction, a space is an object of a gros (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks on some (∞,1)-site. We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
These approaches do not apply to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which requires a different approach to deal with a more complicated notion of gluing; we discuss this below in Noncommutative algebraic geometry.

The above frameworks for higher geometry are not suitable for describing noncommutative algebraic geometry, because of the more complicated notions of localization, gluing and descent in the latter setting. Indeed, noncommutative spaces are supposed to be obtained from affine ones (formal duals of associative algebras or dg-algebras) by gluing along bimodules. A good setting for such gluing is that of pretriangulated dg-categories (or stable (∞,1)-categories). Thus in derived noncommutative algebraic geometry, a noncommutative space is defined to be a stable (∞,1)-category.
Connes-style noncommutative geometry
The process of forming groupoid convolution algebras is a 2-functor from suitable topological and differentiable stacks to C*-algebras with Hilbert bimodules between them. Much of Connes-style noncommutative geometry turns out to deal with objects in the image of this functor, and to the extent that it does, Connes-style noncommutative geometry may be regarded as being a way of speaking about higher geometry, specifically the higher differential geometry of differentiable stacks.

In algebraic geometry, there are two equivalent ways of looking at a scheme: it may be viewed


as a petit topos with a structure sheaf of commutative rings, hence as a locally ringed space,


as an object of the gros topos of sheaves on the site of commutative rings (with étale topology or Zariski topology) satisfying the condition that it is covered by representables via open maps.


In other words, according to viewpoint (2), a scheme may be identified with the sheaf it represents; this sheaf is often called the functor of points of the scheme.
To see this, note that by the Yoneda lemma a scheme may be identified with the sheaf it represents on the gros Zariski site of schemes; and since any scheme admits an affine open cover, the comparison lemma says that sheaves on the site of all schemes may be identified with sheaves on the site of affine schemes.
The functor of points approach has the advantage of making certain constructions much simpler (e.g. the fibered product in the category of schemes), and eliminating the need for certain constructions like the Zariski spectrum. In his famous 1973 Buffalo Colloquium talk, Alexander Grothendieck urged that his earlier definition of scheme via locally ringed spaces should be abandoned in favour of the functorial point of view. This is recalled in Lawvere 03:

 The 1973 Buffalo Colloquium talk by Alexander Grothendieck had as its main theme that the 1960 definition of scheme (which had required as a prerequisite the baggage of prime ideals and the spectral space, sheaves of local rings, coverings and patchings, etc.), should be abandoned AS the FUNDAMENTAL one and replaced by the simple idea of a good functor from rings to sets. The needed restrictions could be more intuitively and more geometrically stated directly in terms of the topos of such functors, and of course the ingredients from the “baggage” could be extracted when needed as auxiliary explanations of already existing objects, rather than being carried always as core elements of the very definition.

and in Lawvere 16:

Peter Gabriel[[…]] had explained some of the same ideas at Oberwolfach in 1965-66, providing a context in which Grothendieck’s proposal seemed natural. For example, he emphasized the traditional view that the points of an algebraic space form a covariant functor on the category of field extensions of the base.
Grothendieck’s advice in his Colloquium talk was that 1960 ingredients (like Zariski opens etc.) are easily extracted from the category of functors, when needed.

Of course, this functorial perspective generalizes to other kinds of geometry and even higher geometry, the general perspective being known as synthetic differential geometry or similar. For discussion of functorial (higher) differential geometry see for instance at smooth set (smooth ∞-groupoid), for discussion of functorial supergeometry see at super formal smooth set (super formal smooth ∞-groupoid).

Der unendlich kleinste Theil des Raumes ist immer ein Raum, etwas, das Continuität hat, nicht aber ein blosser Punct, oder die Grenze zwischen bestimmten Stellen im Raume; (Fichte 1795, Grundriss, §4.IV)

In synthetic differential geometry one formulates differential geometry axiomatically in toposes – called smooth toposes – of generalized smooth spaces by assuming the explicit existence of infinitesimal neighbourhoods of points.
The main point of the axioms is to ensure that a well defined notion of infinitesimal spaces exists in the topos, whose existence concretely and usefully formalizes the wide-spread but often vague intuition about the role of infinitesimals in differential geometry.
In particular, in such toposes EE there exists an infinitesimal space DD that behaves like the infinitesimal interval in such a way that for any space X∈EX \in E the tangent bundle of XX, is, again as an object of the topos, just the internal hom TX:=X DT X \;\text{:=}\; X^D (using the notation of exponential objects in the cartesian closed category EE). So a tangent vector in this context is literally an infinitesimal path in XX.
This way, in smooth toposes it is possible to give precise well-defined meaning to many of the familiar computations – wide-spread in particular in the physics literature – that compute with supposedly “infinitesimal” quantities.

Remark
As quoted by Anders Kock in his first book (p. 9), Sophus Lie – one of the founding fathers of differential geometry and, of course Lie theory – once said that he found his main theorems in Lie theory using “synthetic reasoning”, but had to write them up in non-synthetic style (see analytic versus synthetic) just due to lack of a formalized language:

“The reason why I have postponed for so long these investigations, which are basic to my other work in this field, is essentially the following. I found these theories originally by synthetic considerations. But I soon realized that, as expedient ( zweckmässig ) the synthetic method is for discovery, as difficult it is to give a clear exposition on synthetic investigations, which deal with objects that till now have almost exclusively been considered analytically. After long vacillations, I have decided to use a half synthetic, half analytic form. I hope my work will serve to bring justification to the synthetic method besides the analytical one.” (Sophus Lie, Allgemeine Theorie der partiellen Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung, Math. Ann. 9 (1876).)


Synthetic differential geometry provides this formalized language.

Remark
Another advocate of the use of infinitesimals in the late 19th century was the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce:

The illumination of the subject by a strict notation for the logic of relatives had shown me clearly and evidently that the idea of an infinitesimal involves no contradiction…As a mathematician, I prefer the method of infinitesimals to that of limits, as far easier and less infested with snares. Charles Sanders Peirce, The Law of Mind, The Monist 2 (1892)

According to Bell (1998, p.5):

Peirce was aware, even before Brouwer, that a faithful account of the truly continuous will involve jettisoning the law of excluded(.)


There are two different (related) relationships between Grothendieck topoi and a notion of generalized space. (Recall that a Grothendieck topos TT is a category of sheaves T=Sh(S)T = Sh(S) on some site SS.)
On the one hand, we can regard the topos itself as a generalized space. This tends to be a useful point of view when the site SS is the category of open subsets Op(X)Op(X) of a topological space XX (or some manifold or the like), or some other site which we regard as containing data from only “one space.” In this case, we refer to TT as a little topos, or (if we fail to translate the original French) a petit topos.
On the other hand, we can view a topos TT as a well-behaved category whose objects are generalized spaces. This tends to be a useful point of view when the site SS is a category of all test spaces in some sense, such as Top, Diff, or CartSp. In this case, we refer to TT as a big topos, or (in French) a gros topos.
These distinctions carry over in a straightforward way to higher topoi such as (∞,1)-topoi.
Higher differential geometry is the incarnation of differential geometry in higher geometry. Hence it is concerned with n-groupoid-versions of smooth spaces for higher nn, where the traditional theory is contained in the case n=0n = 0. For n=1n = 1 these higher structures are Lie groupoids, differentiable stacks, their infinitesimal approximation by Lie algebroids and the generalization to smooth stacks. For higher nn this includes (deloopings of) Lie 2-groups, Lie 3-groups.
Fully generally, higher differential geometry hence replaces smooth manifolds (and possibly variants such as supermanifolds, formal manifolds, dg-manifolds etc.) by ∞-stacks ((∞,1)-sheaves) on the site of all such. Technically this means that higher differential geometry is the study of an (∞,1)-topos into which standard differential geometry faithfully embeds. This then allows to speak of smooth ∞-groups, Lie ∞-algebroids.
If the ambient (∞,1)-topos is not 1-localic (for instance over a genuine site of dg-manifolds) then one also speaks of derived differential geometry.
See at motivation for higher differential geometry for motivation.
The standard variants of differential geometry have their higher analogs, for instance symplectic geometry generalizes to higher symplectic geometry and prequantum geometry to higher prequantum geometry.
Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
For more see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Supergeometry may defined over an arbitrary commutative ring (Schwarz and Shapiro 06).
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being


about logic


about geometry.


What is called perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT) is quantum field theory where the interaction (between fields/particles) is treated as a tiny perturbation of the “free field theory” where no interaction is assumed to take place (“perturbation theory”). This is meant to be an approximation to the actual non-perturbative quantum field theory. However, the latter remains elusive except for toy examples of low spacetime dimension, vanishing interaction and/or topological invariance and most of the “quantum field theory” in the literature is tacitly understood to be perturbative.
 Hence pQFT studies the infinitesimal neighbourhood (also called the formal neighbourhood) of free classical field theories in the parameter space of all quantum field theories, the rest of the space being the realm of non-perturbative QFT:
Mathematically this means that the resulting quantum observables in pQFT (typically: scattering amplitudes or “S-matrices” encoded by Feynman diagrams) are formal power series in the coupling constant gg which measures the strength of the interaction (as well as in Planck's constant, which measures the general strength of quantum). This distinguishes perturbative quantum field theory from non-perturbative quantum field theory, where the algebras of quantum observables are supposed to be not formal power series algebras, but C*-algebras.



While just describing a tiny (infinitesimal) part of QFT, perturbative QFT is way better understood than full non-perturbative QFT (which remains ill-understood to the extent that it has been named a Millennium Problem), and has the reputation of still being dramatically successful in practice – though this applies to some field theories (such as QED) much more than to others (such as QCD), see below.
The key object of perturbative QFT is the perturbative scattering matrix which expresses, as a formal power series in the ratio of the coupling constant over Planck's constant, the probability amplitude of scattering processes, namely of processes where free fields in a certain state come in from the far past, interact and hence scatter off each other, and then go off in some other quantum state into the far future. The scattering cross sections thus defined are the quantities which may be directly measured in scattering experiments, such as the LHC accelerator.
The perturbative S-matrix turns out to have an expression as a sum over separate scattering amplitudes for elementary processes labeled by Feynman diagrams, each of which depicts one specific way for fields (particles) to interact with each other. That the full S-matrix is the sum over all amplitudes for all these possible scattering processes, the Feynman perturbation series, is an incarnation of the informal heuristic of the path integral and the superposition principle in quantum physics, which says that the probability amplitude for a specific outcome is the sum over the probability amplitudes of all the possible processes that can contribute to this outcome.
For all interesting interacting field theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics, this scattering matrix formal power series necessarily has vanishing radius of convergence (Dyson 52). If it is assumed that the formal Feynman perturbation series is the Taylor series of an actual smooth function given by the actual non-perturbative quantum field theory that is being approximated, then this means that it is at least an asymptotic series (by this example) whose first couple of terms could sum to a good approximation of the actual value to be computed. Indeed, the sum of the first few loop orders in the S-matrix for QED and QCD in the standard model of particle physics turns out to be in agreement with experiment to good precision.
(There are however known non-perturbative effects which are not captured in perturbation theory, such as confinement in QCD, supposed related to instantons in QCD. In resurgence theory one tries to identify these from the asymptotic nature of the Feynman perturbation series.)
A key step in the construction of perturbative quantum field theory is the renormalization of the point interactions. This comes about because given


a local Lagrangian density defining the nature of the fields and their interactions,


a vacuum state (generally: Hadamard state) that defines the free quantum field theory to be perturbed about


it turns out that the construction of the perturbative S-matrix (the Feynman perturbation series) still involves at each order a finite-dimensional space of choices to be made. Physically, these are the specification of further high energy interactions not seen in the original local Lagrangian density; mathematically, this is the choice of extending the time-ordered product of the interaction, which is an operator-valued distribution, to the locus of coinciding interaction points, in the sense of extensions of distributions.
Historically, perturbative quantum field theory as originally conceived informally by Schwinger-Tomonaga-Feynman-Dyson in the 1940s, had been notorious for the mysterious conceptual nature of its mathematical principles (“divergences”). The mathematically rigorous formulation of renormalization (“removal of UV-divergences”) in perturbative quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime was established by Epstein-Glaser 73, based on Bogoliubov-Shirkov 59 and Stückelberg 51), now known as causal perturbation theory; laid out in the seminal Erice summer school proceeding (Velo-Wightman 76).
The correct definition of the adiabatic limit (“removal of IR divergencies”) was understood in Il’in-Slavnov 78 and eventually developed by Dütsch-Fredenhagen 01, Brunetti-DütschFredenhagen 09, this is now called perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. The rigorous derivation of the previously informal Feynman rules and their dimensional regularization for computation of scattering amplitudes was achieved in Keller 10 (IV.12), Dütsch-Fredenhagen-Keller-Rejzner 14. Quantization of gauge theories (Yang-Mills theory) in causal perturbation theory/perturbative AQFT was then discussed (for trivial principal bundles and restricted to gauge invariant observables) in the spirit of BRST-complex/BV-formalism in (Fredenhagen-Rejzner 11b). The generalization of all these constructions from Minkowski spacetime to perturbative quantum fields on more general spacetimes (i.e. for more general gravitational background fields such as appearing in cosmology or black hole physics) was made possible due to the identification of the proper generalization of vacuum states and their Feynman propagators to Hadamard states on globally hyperbolic spacetimes in Radzikowski 96. The resulting rigorous perturbative QFT on curved spacetimes was developed in a long series of articles by Hollands, Wald, Brunetti, Fredenhagen and others, now called locally covariant perturbative AQFT.
While this establishes a rigorous construction of perturbative quantum field theory on general gravitational backgrounds, the construction principles had remained somewhat ad-hoc: The axioms for the perturbative S-matrix (equivalently for the time-ordered products or retarded products of field operators) were well motivated by comparison with the Dyson series in quantum mechanics, by the heuristics of the path integral and not the least by their excellent confirmation by experiment, but had not been derived from first principles of quantization. Then in Dütsch Fredenhagen 01 it was observed that the Wick algebras of quantum observables in free quantum field theory are equivalently the Moyal deformation quantization of the canonical Poisson bracket (the Peierls bracket or causal propagator) on the covariant phase space of the free field theory (or rather of a choice of Hadamard state for it) and Collini 16 showed that under suitable conditions the perturbative interacting observable algebra is the Fedosov deformation quantization of covariant phase space of the interacting theory. A general argument to this extent was given in Hawkins-Rejzner 16.
This suggests that the construction of the full non-perturbative quantum field theory ought to be given by a strict deformation quantization of the covariant phase space. But presently no example of such for non-trivial interaction in spacetime dimension ≥4\geq 4 is known. In particular the phenomenologically interesting case of a complete construction of interacting field theories on 4-dimensional spacetimes is presently unknown. For the case of Yang-Mills theory this open problem to go beyond perturbative quantum field theory is one of the “Millennium Problems” (see at quantization of Yang-Mills theory). For the case of quantum gravity this is possibly the 10 410^4-year problem that the field is facing. But observe that as a perturbative (effective“) quantum field theory, quantum gravity does fit into the framework of perturbative QFT, is mathematically well-defined and makes predictions, see the references there.

main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory

Broad idea
The Green-Schwarz action functional is an action functional for a sigma-model that describes the propagation of a fundamental super pp-brane Σ\Sigma in a super spacetime supermanifold.


For p=0p = 0 this is the Green-Schwarz superparticle.


For p=1p = 1 this is the Green-Schwarz superstring (Green-Schwarz 84)


For p=2p =2 this is the Green-Schwarz supermembrane (Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87)


The Green-Schwarz model of the superstring is in contrast to the NSR-string model (the original spinning string), which has manifest worldsheet supersymmetry but no manifest spacetime supersymmetry. It is a non-trivial theorem that the spectrum of the NSR-string enjoys spacetime supersymmetry (after GSO projection) and may hence be identified with perturbative excitations of a supergravity background. The construction of the Green-Schwarz functional was motivated by the desire to find an equivalent alternative formulation in which spacetime supersymmetry is manifest (see e.g. Schwarz 16, slides 24-25).

More details
Perturbativestring theory on geometric backgrounds is defined by the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond model, namely by sigma-model 2d super conformal field theories (of central charge 15) on worldsheets Σ\Sigma that are super Riemann surfaces, with target spaces XX that are ordinary (i.e. “bosonic”) spacetime manifolds.
These worldsheet field theories are induced from action functionals, namely from variants of the standard energy functional (Polyakov action) on the mapping space [Σ,X][\Sigma,X] of smooth functions
ϕ:Σ⟶X
  \phi \;\colon\; \Sigma \longrightarrow X


from the worldsheet Σ\Sigma to target spacetime XX.
The central theorem of perturbative superstring theory (the no ghost theorem with GSO projection) says that the excitation spectrum of such a 2d SCFT are the quanta of the perturbations of a higher dimensional effective supergravity field theory on target spacetime, hence transforms under supersymmetry on target spacetime.
This is the fundamental prediction of the assumption of fundamental strings:


assuming that the fundamental particles that run in Feynman diagrams are fundamentally (at high energy) the ground state modes of a fundamental string,


demanding that there are fermionic particles among these,


implies


that the string must be the spinning string (have fermions in its worldsheet theory), which in turn implies…


that it is the superstring (worldsheet supersymmetry mixes the worldsheet bosons and fermions), precisely: the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring, which then in addition implies…


that its target space effective field theory is a supergravity theory, hence that also the effective target space fields exhibit local supersymmetry (i.e. “high energy supersymmetry”, different from “low energy supersymmetry” that the LHC was looking for).

The first step in this implication (identifying the spinning string as the superstring) is fairly straightforward (in fact this is how the concept of supersymmetry was discovered in “the west”, in the first place), but the second step (that the superstring excitations necessarily are quanta of a spacetime supergravity theory) appears as a miracle from the point of view of the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring. It comes out this way by non-trivial computation, but is not manifest in the theory.
In order to improve on this situation, Michael Green and John Schwarz searched for and found (Green-Schwarz 81, Green-Schwarz 82 Green-Schwarz 84, for the history see Schwarz 16, slides 24-25) a suitably equivalent string action functional that would manifestly exhibit spacetime supersymmetry. Acordingly, this is now called the Green-Schwarz action functional.

The basic idea is to pass to the evident supergeometric analogue of the bosonic string action:
Let Σ\Sigma be a closed manifold of dimension 2 – representing the abstract worldsheet of a string. Let (X,g)(X,g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold – representing a purely gravitational spacetime background. Then the action functional governing the bosonic string propagating in this spacetime is the functional
exp(iℏS bos):[Σ,X]⟶ℝ/ ℏℤ
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{bos})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]
   \longrightarrow
  \mathbb{R}/_{\hbar}\mathbb{Z}


on the smooth mapping space [Σ,X][\Sigma,X] (of smooth functions Σ→X\Sigma \to X), that simply assigns the proper relativistic volume of the image of the worldsheet Σ\Sigma in spacetime:
(Σ⟶ϕX)↦S kin(ϕ)≔∫ Σvol ϕ *g.
  (\Sigma\overset{\phi}{\longrightarrow} X)
    \;\mapsto\;
  S_{kin}(\phi)
  \coloneqq
  \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast g}
  \,.


(This is the Nambu-Goto action. It is classically equivalent to the Polyakov action which is the genuine starting point for the quantum Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string. However, since, as we discuss below, the Green-Schwarz action naturally generalizes to that of other p-branes it is more natural to consider the Nambu-Goto form of the action here.)
When here (X,g)(X,g) is generalized to a superspacetime supermanifold with orthogonal structure encoded by a super-vielbein ee, then the same form of the action functional still makes sense and produces a functional on the supergeometric mapping space [Σ,X][\Sigma,X]. Moreover, by construction this action functional now is invariant under the superisometry group of (X,g)(X,g), hence under global spacetime supersymmetry.

However, Green and Schwarz noticed that this kinetic action functional ϕ↦∫ Σvol ϕ *e\phi \mapsto \int_\Sigma vol_{\phi^\ast e} does not quite yield dynamics that is equivalent to that of the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond super-string: when the equations of motion hold (“on shell”) it has more fermionic degrees of freedom than present in the Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string. The key insight of Green and Schwarz was that one may add an extra summand S WZWS_{WZW} (whose notation we explain in a moment) to the plain super-Nambu-Goto action S kinS_{kin}, such that the resulting action functional enjoys a further 1-parameter symmetry, called kappa-symmetry. This is the Green-Schwarz action functional:
S GS=S kin+S WZW.
  S_{GS} = S_{kin} + S_{WZW}
  \,.


Moreover, they showed that restricting the dynamics of the Green-Schwarz superstring to the κ\kappa-symmetric states, then it does become equivalent, classically to that of the Neveu-Ramond-Schwarz super-string.
Finally they showed that when gauge fixing the Green-Schwarz action functional to light-cone gauge (which is possible whenever target spacetime admits two lightlike Killing vector) then the Green-Schwarz string may be quantized by a standard procedure and the resulting quantum dynamics is equivalent to that of the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond super-string. This provides the desired conceptual proof for the observed local target spacetime supersymmetry of super-string effective field theory, at least for backgrounds that admit two lightlike Killing vectors. (The quantization of the Green-Schwarz superstring away from light cone gauge remains an open problem.)
While Green-Schwarz’s extra kappa-symmetry term S WZWS_{WZW} this serves a clear purpose as a means to an end, originally its geometric meaning was mysterious. However, in (Henneaux-Mezincescu 85) it was observed (expanded on in (Rabin 87, Azcarraga-Townsend 89, Azcarraga-Izquierdo 95,chapter 8)), that the Green-Schwarz action functional describing the super-string in d+1d+1-dimensions does have a neat geometrical interpretation: it is simply the (parameterized) Wess-Zumino-Witten model for

for N\mathbf{N} a real spin representation (the “number of supersymmetries”), Iso(ℝ d−1,1|N)Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}) the corresponding super Poincaré group and Spin(d−1,1)Spin(d-1,1) its Lorentz-signature Spin subgroup;

μ F1=ψ¯∧Γ Aψ∧e a
  \mu_{F1} = \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_A \psi \wedge e_a


and so in components the bi-fermionic component of μ F1\mu_{F1} is
(μ F1) aαβ=Γ aαβ
  (\mu_{F1})_{a \alpha \beta} = \Gamma_{a \alpha \beta}


and all other components vanish.


More in detail, just as ordinary Minkowski spacetime ℝ d−1,1\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1} may be identified with the translation group along itself, with canonical linear basis of left invariant 1-forms given by the canonical vielbein field
{e a≔dx a} a=0 d−1,
  \{e^a \coloneqq \mathbf{d}x^a\}_{a = 0}^{d-1}
  \,,


where {x a}\{x^a\} are the canonical coordinates on ℝ d−1,1\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}, so super Minkowski spacetime ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}} for some real spin representation N\mathbf{N} is characterized as the supergroup whose left invariant 1-forms constitute the ℤ×ℤ/2ℤ\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}-bigraded differential with generators the super-vielbein

  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \underset{deg = (1,odd)}{\underbrace{\psi^\alpha}} \;\coloneqq\; \mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha
  \,,


where (x a,θ α)(x^a, \theta^\alpha) are the canonical coordinates on ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}, with the odd-graded elements {θ α}\{\theta^\alpha\} spanning the given real Spin(d-1,1)-representation N\mathbf{N} with Clifford algebra generators {Γ a}\{\Gamma^a\}.
Now while ordinary Minkowski spacetime ℝ d−1,1\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1} is an abelian group, reflected by the fact that its left-invariant 1-forms are all closed
de a=0onℝ d−1,1,
  \mathbf{d}e^a = 0 \;\;\;\;\;\; on \; \mathbb{R}^{d-1,1}
  \,,


the key phenomenon of supersymmetry (that two fermions pair to a bosons) means that ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}} is slightly non-abelian, reflected by the fact that the super-vielbein is not closed
de a=ψ¯∧Γ aψ,dψ α=0.
  \mathbf{d} e^a =  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^a \psi
  \;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} \psi^\alpha = 0
  \,.


This elementary effect is the source of all the rich structure seen in the Green-Schwarz super-string and generally in all super p-brane theory. (The above differential is equivalently that in the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of super Minkowski spacetime, hence its cohomology is the super-Lie algebra cohomology of super Minkowski spacetime. In parts of the physics literature this is referred to a “tau cohomology”.)
In particular, for special combinations of spacetime dimension dd and number of supersymmetries N\mathbf{N} (i.e. real spin representation NN) then the 3-form
μ F1=ψ¯∧Γ aψ∧e a
  \mu_{F1} =  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma_a \psi \wedge e^a


is a non-trivial super Lie algebra cocycle on ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}, in that dμ F1=0\mathbf{d}\mu_{F1} = 0 and so that there is no left invariant differential form bb with db=μ F1\mathbf{d}b = \mu_{F1} (beware here the left-invariance condition: there are of course non-left-invariant potentials for μ F1\mu_{F1}, and in fact these are exactly the possible Lagrangian densities for the WZW action functional S WZWS_{WZW}).
This happens notably for


d=10d = 10 and N=(1,0)=16\mathbf{N} = (1,0) = \mathbf{16} (heterotic string)


d=10d = 10 and N=(2,0)=16+16\mathbf{N} = (2,0) = \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16} (type IIB superstring)


d=10d = 10 and N=(1,1)=16+16 *\mathbf{N} = (1,1) = \mathbf{16} + \mathbf{16}^\ast (type IIA superstring).


(It also happens in some lower dimensions, where however the corresponding Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond string develops a conformal anomaly after quantization (“non-critical strings”). This classification of cocycles is part of what has come to be known as the brane scan in superstring theory, see below.)
In this equivalent formulation, the Green-Schwarz action functional for the superstring has the following simple form:
Let (X,e)(X,e) be a superspacetime, hence a supermanifold XX equipped with a super-vielbein ee (super-orthogonal structure) which is locally modeled on ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}} (technically: a torsion-free super-Cartan geometry modeled on Spin(d−1,1)↪Iso(ℝ d−1,1|N)Spin(d-1,1) \hookrightarrow Iso(\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}})). Write μ F1 X∈Ω 3(X)\mu_{F1}^X \in \Omega^3(X) for the super differential form on XX which is the induced definite globalization of the cocycle μ F1\mu_{F1} over XX. For U⊂XU \subset X any contractible subspace, then the restriction of μ F1 X| U∈Ω 3(U)\mu^X_{F1}|_{U} \in \Omega^3(U) of μ F1 X\mu_{F1}^X to UU is exact, and hence admits a potential B U∈Ω 2(U)B_U \in \Omega^2(U), i.e. such that dB=μ F1 X| U\mathbf{d} B = \mu^X_{F1}|_U.
Then for Σ\Sigma a 2-dimensional closed manifold, the Green-Schwarz action functional
exp(iℏS GS):[Σ,X] U⟶ℝ/ ℏℤ
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{GS})
  \;\colon\;
  [\Sigma,X]_U
    \longrightarrow

is the function on the super-smooth mapping space [Σ,X] U[\Sigma,X]_U of morphisms of supermanifolds ϕ:Σ→X\phi \colon \Sigma \to X which factor through UU, given by
ϕ↦∫ Σvol ϕ *e+∫ Σϕ *B U,dB U=μ 3 X| U.

   \;+\;
  \int_\Sigma \phi^\ast B_U
  \;\;\;\,,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \mathbf{d} B_U = \mu^X_3|_U
  \,.


In order to get rid of the restriction to some chart U⊂XU \subset X one needs to add global data. The need for this is at least mentioned briefly in (Witten 86, p. 261 (17 of 20)), but seems to have otherwise been ignored in the physics literature. The general solution is to promote the local potentials BB to the connection B^\hat B on a super gerbe (FSS 13). This is a choice of higher prequantization

Writing ∫ Σϕ *B^\int_\Sigma \phi^\ast \hat B for the volume holonomy of a circle 2-bundle with connection B^\hat B, then the globally defined Green-Schwarz sigma model

This form of the Green-Schwarz action functional for the string has evident generalization to other p-branes. Whenever there is a Spin(d-1,1)-invariant (p+2)(p+2)-cocycle μ p+2\mu_{p+2} on ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}}, then one may ask for a higher gerbe (higher prequantum line bundle) C^\hat C with curvature μ p+2 X\mu^X_{p+2} and consider the analogous functional.
The triples (d,N,p)(d,\mathbf{N},p) (spacetime dimension, number of supersymmetries, dimension of brane) such that

    \;\coloneqq\;
  \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}


is a nontrivial cocycle, hence for which there is such a Green-Schwarz action functional for pp-branes on ℝ d−1,1|N\mathbb{R}^{d-1,1\vert \mathbf{N}} may be classified and form what is called the brane scan (Achúcarro-Evans-TownsendWiltshire 87, Brandt 12-13):




The graphics on the left is from (Duff 87). The diagonal lines indicate double dimensional reduction, taking a (p+1)(p+1)-brane in (d+1)(d+1) dimensions to a pp-brane in dd-dimensions.
For instance for (d=11,N=32,p=2)(d = 11, \; \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{32}, \; p = 2) one finds a cocycle, and the corresponding GS-action functional is that of the fundamental M2-brane.
This was a striking confluence of brane physics and classification of super Lie algebra cohomology. But just as striking as the matching, was what it lacked to match: the D-branes and the M5-brane (d=11d = 11, p=5p = 5) are lacking from the old brane scan. Incidentally, these lacking branes are precisely those branes on which the branes that do appear on the brane scan may end, equivalently those branes that have higher gauge fields on their worldvolume (tensor multiplets).
An action functional for the M5-brane analogous to a Green-Schwarz action functional was found in (BLNPST 97, APPS 97). It is again the sum of a kinetic term and a WZW-like term, but the WZW-like term does not come from a cocycle on a (super-)group.
In order to deal with this, it was suggested in (CAIB 99, Sakaguchi 00, Azcarraga-Izquierdo 01) that there is an algebraic structure called “extended super-Minkowski spacetimes” that generalizes super Minkowski spacetime and serves to unify the Green-Schwarz-like models for the D-branes and the M5-brane with the original Green-Schwarz models for the string and the M2-brane.
These extended super-Minkowski spacetimes carry algebraic analogs of super Lie algebra cocycles, such that the relevant terms for the D-branes and the M5-brane do appear after all, hence such that all the branes in string theory/M-theory are unified. In fact these “extended super-Minkowski spacetimes” are precisely the “FDA”s that have been introduced before in the D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity and what became identified as the 7-cocycle for the M5-brane this way had earlier been recognized algebraically as an stepping stone for an elegant re-derivation of 11-dimensional supergravity (D’Auria-Fré 82).
The (higher) geometric meaning of these constructions was found in (Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13): these algebraic structures of “extended super-Minkowski spacetimes”/FDAs are precisely the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras of super Lie n-algebra-extensions of super-Minkowski spacetime which are classified by the cocycles that serve as the GS-WZW terms of the p 1p_1-branes that may end on those p 2p_2-branes whose cocycles are carried by the extended super-Minkowski spacetime.
Hence the missing pp-branes in the old brane scan (classifying just cocycles on super Lie algebras) do appear as one generalizes (super) Lie algebras to (super) strong homotopy Lie algebras = L-infinity algebras. Moreover, each brane intersection law (one brane species may end on another) is now matched to a super L ∞L_\infty-algebra extension and so the old brane scan is generalized to a tree of branes The brane bouquet:

Each item in this bouquet denotes a super L-infinity algebra and each arrow denotes an L-infinity extension classified by a cocycle which encodes the GS-WZW term of the brane named by the domain of the arrow. Moreover, arrows pass exactly from one brane species to the brane species that may end on the former.
In (Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13) it is shown that all these super L-infinity algebras Lie integrate to smooth super-n-groups, and all the cocycles Lie integrate to super-gerbes on these, such that the induced volume holonomy is the relevant generalized GS-WZW term. For detailed exposition see at Structure Theory for Higher WZW Terms.
With this generalized perspective, now the Green-Schwarz-type action functionals describe all the p-branes in string theory/M-theory.
Again, in order to make this generally true one needs to apply a higher prequantization – a choice of line (p+1)-bundle with connection – in order to globalize the WZW-terms (Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 13)
  B p+1(ℝ/ ℏℤ) prequantization   A^ p+1↗ ↓ curv X ⟶μ p+2 X Ω p+2 (p+2)-form curvature.

     &\underset{\mu^X_{p+2}}{\longrightarrow}&

  \,.


Hence A^ p+1\hat A_{p+1} is the actual background field that the pp-brane couples to. There is considerably more information in A^ p\hat A_p than in its curvature curv(A^ p+1)=μ p+2curv(\hat A_{p+1}) = \mu_{p+2}. For instance for the M2-brane one may find the local super moduli space for local choices of A^ p+1\hat A_{p+1} for the given μ 4\mu_{4} on KK-compactifications to d=4d = 4. It turns out that the bosonic body of this moduli space is the exceptional tangent bundle on which the U-duality group E7 has a canonical action (see at From higher to exceptional geometry).
This highlights that Green-Schwarz functionals capture fundamental (“microscopic”) aspects of pp-branes. In contrast, often pp-branes are discussed in their solitonic incarnation as black branes. These solitonic branes sit at asymptotic boundaries of anti-de Sitter spacetime and carry conformal field theories, related to the ambient supergravity by AdS-CFT duality.
This phenomenon is indeed a consequence of the fundamental Green-Schwarz branes:
Consider a 1/2-BPS state solution of type II supergravity or 11-dimensional supergravity, respectively. These solutions locally happen to have the same classification as the Green-Schwarz branes. Hence we may consider a configuration ϕ:Σ→X\phi \colon \Sigma \to X of the corresponding fundamental pp-brane which embeds Σ\Sigma into the asymptotic AdS boundary of the given 1/2 BPS spacetime XX. Then it turns out that restricting the Green-Schwarz action functional to small fluctuations around this configuration, and applying a diffeomorphism gauge fixing, then the resulting action functional is that of a supersymmetric conformal field theory on Σ\Sigma as in the AdS-CFT dictionary:

(Claus-Kallosh-Proeyen 97, Claus-Kallosh-Kumar-Townsend 98, AFFFTT 98 Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin 99)
In fact the BPS-state condition itself is neatly encoded in the Green-Schwarz action functionals: by construction they are invariant under the spacetime superisometry group. Hence the Noether theorem implies that there are corresponding conserved currents, whose Dickey bracket forms a super-Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra of supersymmetries.

Here the “⇙\swArrow” filling the triangles is the non-trivial gauge transformation by which the WZW term (as any WZW term) is preserved under the symmetries (instead of being fixed identically). It is the information in this transformations which makes the currents form an extension of the symmetries.
Here this yields the famous brane charge extensions of the super-isometry super Lie algebra of the schematic form

(for QQ a Killing spinor and PP its corresponding Killing vector) known as the type II supersymmetry algebra and the M-theory supersymmetry algebra, respectively (Azcárraga-Gauntlett-Izquierdo-Townsend 89). In fact it yields super-Lie n-algebra extensions of which the familiar super Lie algebra extensions are the 0-truncation (Sati-Schreiber 15, Khavkine-Schreiber 16).
In summary, the nature and classification of Green-Schwarz action functionals captures in a mathematically precise way a good deal of the core structure of string/M-theory.
In fact, the super Lie-n algebraic perspective on the Green-Schwarz functionals via the brane bouquet also solves the following open problem on M-branes:
it is famously known from Freed-Witten anomaly-cancellation that the D-brane charges are not in fact just in de Rham cohomology in every second degree, but are in twisted K-theory, hence rationally in twisted de Rham cohomology, with the twist being the F1-brane charge (from the fundamental). It is an open problem to determine what becomes of these twisted K-theory charge groups as one lifts F1/Dpp-branes in string theory to M2/M5-branes in M-theory.

Notice that there are “microscopic degrees of freedom” of the theory encoded by the choice of generalized cohomology theory here, generalizing the extra degrees of freedom in the choice of a WZW-term already mentioned above. In general for EE a cohomology theory and E⟶E⊗ℚE \longrightarrow E \otimes \mathbb{Q} its Chern character map (for instance from topological K-theory to ordinary cohomology in every second degree), then a choice of genuine charges is the extra information encoded in a lift

    \\
    X &\underset{\text{rational} \atop  \text{charge}}{\longrightarrow}& E \otimes \mathbb{Q}
  }


But rationally The brane bouquet allows to derive this from first principles:
Above we saw that the naive cocycles of the D-branes and of the M5-brane are not defined on the actual spacetime, but on some “extended” spacetime, which is really a smooth super infinity-groupoid extension of spacetime. Hence we should ask if these cocycles descend to the actual super-spacetime while picking up some twists.
One may prove that:


the F1/Dpp-brane GS-WZW cocycles descend to 10d type II superspacetime to form a single cocycle in rational twisted K-theory, just as the traditional lore reqires (Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16);


the M2/M5 GS-WZW cocycles descent to 11d superspacetime to form a single cocycle with values in the rational 4-sphere (Fiorenza-Sati-Schreiber 16).


This has implications on some open conjectures regarding M-theory, for more on this see Equivariant cohomology of M2/M5-branes.
The Green-Schwarz action functionals are of the standard sigma-model form for target spaces that are super-homogeneous spaces G/HG/H for GG a Lie supergroup and HH a sub-super-group, and for background gauge fields that are super-WZW-circle n-bundles with connection/bundle gerbes on GG.

for branes on super Minkowski spacetime: 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is the super Poincaré Lie algebra and 𝔥\mathfrak{h} the Lorentz Lie algebra;

These action functionals were first considered in (Green-Schwarz 84) for superstrings in various dimensions. The full interpretation of the action functional as an higher Wess-Zumino-Witten theory-type action controled by the Lie algebra cohomology of the super Poincaré Lie algebra (or rather of the super translation Lie algebra inside it) is due to (Azcárraga-Townsend89).

for branes on super anti de Sitter spacetime, GG is a superconformal group (e.g. Metsaev-Tseytlin 98, section 3)

Supercoordinates
We briefly review some basics of the canonical coordinates and the super Lie algebra cohomology of the super Poincaré Lie algebra and super Minkowski space, which are referred to below (see for instance Azcárraga-Townsend 89, and see at super Cartesian space and at signs in supergeometry.).
By the general discussion at Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra, we may characterize the super Poincaré Lie algebra 𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(D−1,1)\mathfrak{siso}(D-1,1) by its CE-algebra CE(𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(D−1,1))CE(\mathfrak{siso}(D-1,1)) “of left-invariant 1-forms” on its group manifold.

Definition
The Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra CE(𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1))CE(\mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)) is generated on


elements {e a}\{e^a\} and {ω ab}\{\omega^{ a b}\} of degree (1,even)(1,even)


and elements {ψ α}\{\psi^\alpha\} of degree (1,odd)(1,odd)


with the differential defined by
d CEω ab=ω a b∧ω bc
  d_{CE} \omega^{a b} = \omega^a{}_b \wedge \omega^{b c}

d CEe a=ω a b∧e b+i2ψ¯Γ aψ
  d_{CE} e^{a } = \omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b + \frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi

d CEψ=14ω abΓ abψ.
  d_{CE} \psi = \frac{1}{4} \omega^{ a b} \Gamma_{a b} \psi
  \,.


Removing the terms involving ω\omega here this is the super translation algebra.

In this way the super-Poincaré Lie algebra and its extensions is usefully discussed for instance in (D’Auria-Fré 82) and in (Azcárraga-Townsend 89, CAIB 99). In much of the literature instead the following equivalent notation is popular, which more explicitly involves the coordinates on super Minkowski space.

Remark
The abstract generators in def.  are identified with left invariant 1-forms on the super-translation group (= super Minkowski space) as follows.
Let (x a,θ α)(x^a, \theta^\alpha) be the canonical coordinates on the supermanifold ℝ d|N\mathbb{R}^{d|N} underlying the super translation group. Then the identification is


ψ α=dθ α\psi^\alpha = d \theta^\alpha.


e a=dx a+i2θ¯Γ adθe^a = d x^a + \frac{i}{2} \overline{\theta} \Gamma^a d \theta.


Notice that this then gives the above formula for the differential of the super-vielbein in def.  as
de a =d(dx a+i2θ¯Γ adθ)  =i2dθ¯Γ adθ  =i2ψ¯Γ aψ.
  \begin{aligned}
    d e^a & = d (d x^a + \frac{i}{2} \overline{\theta} \Gamma^a d \theta)
    \\
    & = \frac{i}{2} d \overline{\theta}\Gamma^a d \theta
    \\
    & = \frac{i}{2} \overline{\psi}\Gamma^a \psi
  \end{aligned}
  \,.



Remark
The term i2ψ¯Γ aψ\frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi is sometimes called the supertorsion of the super-vielbein ee, because the defining equation
d CEe a−ω a b∧e b=i2ψ¯Γ aψ
  d_{CE} e^{a } -\omega^a{}_b \wedge e^b = \frac{i}{2}\bar \psi \Gamma^a \psi


may be read as saying that ee is torsion-free except for that term. Notice that this term is the only one that appears when the differential is applied to “Lorentz scalars”, hence to object in CE(𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬)CE(\mathfrak{siso}) which have “all indices contracted”. (See also at torsion constraints in supergravity.)
Notably we have
d(ψ¯∧Γ a 1⋯a pψ∧e a 1∧⋯∧e a p)∝(ψ¯∧Γ a 1⋯a pψ∧e a 1∧⋯∧e a p−1)∧(Ψ¯∧Γ a pΨ).
  d \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}
  \right)
  \propto
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_{p-1}}
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\Psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_p} \Psi
  \right)
  \,.


This remaining operation “e↦Ψ 2e \mapsto \Psi^2” of the differential acting on Loretz scalars is sometimes denoted “t 0t_0”, e.g. in (Bossard-Howe-Stelle 09, equation (8)).
This relation is what govers all of the exceptional super Lie algebra cocycles that appear as WZW terms for the Green-Schwarz action below: for some combinations of (D,p)(D,p) a Fierz identity implies that the term
(ψ¯∧Γ a 1⋯a pψ∧e a 1∧⋯∧e a p−1)∧(Ψ¯∧Γ a pΨ)
  \left(
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_{p-1}}
  \right)
  \wedge
  \left(
    \overline{\Psi} \wedge \Gamma_{a_p} \Psi
  \right)


vanishes identically, and hence in these dimensions the term
ψ¯∧Γ a 1⋯a pψ∧e a 1∧⋯∧e a p
    \overline{\psi} \wedge \Gamma^{a_1 \cdots a_p} \psi
    \wedge e_{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{a_p}


is a cocycle. See also the brane scan table below.

WZW term
Let (e a,ω ab,ψ α)(e^a, \omega^{a b}, \psi^\alpha) be the standard generators of the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra CE(𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d,1))CE(\mathfrak{siso}(d,1)) of the super Poincaré Lie algebra, as discussed there.
The part of the Lie algebra cohomology of the super translation Lie algebra that is invariant under the Lorentz transformations is spanned by closed elements of the form
μ=(dθ¯Γ a 1,⋯,a p∧dθ)∧Π a 1∧⋯∧Π a p.
  \mu =
  (d \bar \theta \Gamma_{a_1, \cdots, a_p} \wedge d \theta)
  \wedge
  \Pi^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \Pi^{a_p}
  \,.


These exist (are closed) only for certain combinations of dd and pp. The possible values are listed below.
For a bosonic WZW model the background gauge field induced by such a cocycle would be the corresponding Lie integration to a circle n-bundle with connection. Here, since the super translation group is contractible, a Poincaré lemma applies and these circle nn-connections are simply given by globally defined connection form β\beta satisfying
dβ=μ.
  d \beta = \mu
  \,.


The WZW part of the GS action is then
S WZW:ϕ↦∫ Σϕ *β
  S_{WZW } : \phi \mapsto \int_\Sigma \phi^* \beta

Siegel- or κ\kappa-symmetry
The Green-Schwarz action has an extra fermionic symmetry, on top of the genuine supersymmetry, first observed in (Siegel 83) for the superparticle and in (Siegel 84) for the super 1-brane in 3d, and finally in (GreenSchwarz 84) for the critical superstring in 10-dimensions. This is also called kappa-symmetry. It has a natural interpretation in terms of the super-Cartan geometry of target space (McArthur, GKW). Discussion from the point of view of the D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity is in (AFFFTT 98, section 3, Fré-Grassi 07, section 2.2).
Dimensions – the brane scan
The Green-Schwarz action functional of a pp-brane propagating on an dd-dimensional target spacetimes makes sense only for special combinations of (p,d)(p,d), for which there are suitanble super Lie algebra cocycles on the super translation Lie algebra (see above).
The corresponding table has been called the brane scan in the literature, now often called the “old brane scan”, since it has meanwhile been further completed (see below). In (Duff 87) the “old brane scan” is displayed as follows.

In the D=10D = 10-row we see the critical superstring of string theory and its magnetic dual, the NS5-brane. The top row shows the M2-brane in 11-dimensional supergravity.
Moving down and left the diagonals corresponds to double dimensional reduction.

Remark
The first non-empty column of the table is a reflection of the exceptional isomorphisms of the spin group in low dimensions and the normed division algebras:

Remark
What is missing in the “old brane scan” are the D-branes in D=10D = 10 and the M5-brane in D=11D = 11 (See also BPST). The reason is that the M5 corresponds to a 7-cocycle not on the ordinary super Poincaré Lie algebra, but on its L-infinity algebra extension, the supergravity Lie 3-algebra. The completion in super L-infinity algebra theory is discussed in (FSS 13), as The brane bouquet.

So (with notation as above) we have the following.

On curved spacetime and supergravity equations of motion

∇:X→BSuperPoincare(d−1,1) conn

hence a principal connection for the super Poincaré group such such that at each point x∈Xx \in X it identifies the tangent space with ℝ d;N=𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)/𝔬(d−1,1)\mathbb{R}^{d;N} = \mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)/\mathfrak{o}(d-1,1)

Hence given a Lie algebra cocycle
𝔤⟶ℝ[2]
  \mathfrak{g} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}[2]


as for the Green-Schwarz superstring we can pull it back along this Cartan connection to a differential 3-form on spacetime.
In general this 3-form is no longer closed. If it is closed, then the Green-Schwarz superstring is again well defined on (X,∇)(X,\nabla) as a WZW model.
The claim now is that requiring this 3-form still to be closed is, as a condition on the field of gravity ∇\nabla, precisely the equations of motion of supergravity (the super-Einstein equations).
This is due to (Nilsson 81, Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 86) and others, see the references below.
Membrane in 11d SuGra background
For the membrane(M2-brane) in a background of 11-dimensional supergravity (Bergshoeff-Sezgin-Townsend 87) find that consistency requires that (in a given coordinate chart with super-vielbein field (E A)=(E a,Ψ α)(E^A) = (E^a, \Psi^\alpha)) the 4-form flux is of the form
(1)H =Ψ¯∧Γ abΨ∧E a∧E b+dC 3  =Γ abαβE a∧E b∧E α∧E β+dC 3
  
  \begin{aligned}
     H & = \overline{\Psi}\wedge\Gamma^{ab} \Psi \wedge E_a \wedge E_b + \mathbf{d}C_3
     \\
     & =
     \Gamma_{a b \alpha \beta} E^a \wedge E^b \wedge E^\alpha \wedge E^\beta +
    \mathbf{d}C_3
  \end{aligned}


where the first summand is the super-Lie algebra cocycle that classifies the supergravity Lie 3-algebra and the second is the field strength of the supergravity C-field proper (hence a purely bosonic differential form). In the second line we have rewritten this more manifestly in terms of the super-vielbein (E A)=(E a,E α)=(E a,Ψ α)(E^A) = (E^a, E^\alpha) = (E^a, \Psi^\alpha), this way the expression is directly analogous to that of definite 3-forms in the theory of G2-manifolds (see this example for details).
Moreover the torsion tensor TT is to have its (T a) α β(T^a)^\alpha{}_\beta-component equal to (Γ a) α β(\Gamma^a)^\alpha{}_\beta, see at torsion constraints in supergravity.
In addition the Bianchi identities have to hold:


∇T A=E B∧R B A\nabla T^A = E^B \wedge R_{B}{}^{A}


∇H=0\nabla H = 0 (covariant constancy).


All this is implied by the equations of motion of 11-dimensional supergravity.
Notice that in view of the above analogy to G2-structure, the covariant constancy condition is precisely the analog of G2-manifold structure.
Discussion of this in the somewhat more streamlined D'Auria-Fré formulation of supergravity is in (AFFFTT 98, section 3.1).
Heterotic string
Discussion that for the GS-version of the heterotic string consistency of the background is equivalent to the equations of motion of heterotic supergravity is in (Shapiro-Taylor 87).
Discussion with the hetetoric gauge field included is in (Atick-Dhar-Ratra 86).

Discussion for the GS-version of the type II superstring in type II supergravity-backgrounds is in (GHMNT 85), and for the D-branes in type II in (CGNSW 97).
Conserved currents
The super-WZW term of the GS action functionals is invariant under supersymmetry only up to a divergence. Hence the Noether theorem in its generality for “weak” symmetries applies and gives that the conserved currents receive an extra contribution from this divergence term. The resulting algebra is a central extension of the given super translation Lie algebra, extending to the famous polyvector extensions “by brane charges” of the super Poincaré Lie algebra (AGIT 89).
As part of the AdS-CFT correspondence
By the above discussion, Green-Schwarz super pp-branes are consistent on superspacetimes that satisfy the respective higher supergravity equations of motion. These turn out to have solutions which exhibit black branes in essentially just the combinations of dimensions and supersymmetries that the original Green-Schwarz sigma-models exist in, hence they look precisely like the non-perturbative avatars of whatever these sigma models give the perturbation theory of by second quantization. (See at black holes in string theory for more on this correspondence between branes in string perturbation theory and black branes in supergravity.)
Moreover, the near-horizon geometries of these black branes are always anti de Sitter spacetime times orthogonal directions.
Therefore it is natural to consider the perturbation of the Green-Schwarz sigma-models around their asymptotic embeddings into AdS spaces, hence effectively the perturbation theory of the degrees of freedom at those naked singularity at which the corresponding black brane sits.
After diffeomorphism gauge fixing one finds that the resulting field theories now on the pp-brane worldvolumes are precisely the superconformal field theories for all the allowed superconformal supersymmetries (see also at singleton representation):
ddNNsuperconformal super Lie algebraR-symmetrybrane worldvolume theory32k+12k+1B(k,2)≃B(k,2) \simeq  osp(2k+1/4)(2k+1/4)SO(2k+1)SO(2k+1)

6kkD(4,k)≃D(4,k) \simeq osp(8/2k)(8/2k)Sp(k)Sp(k)M5-brane

This is effectively the AdS-CFT correspondence.
Detailed discussion of the above steps is in (AFFFTT 98, Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin 99). The resulting “super-conformal brane scan” is discussed in Blencowe & Duff 1988 with further developments in Duff 2009, Duff 2021.
Quantization
The quantization of the Green-Schwarz super pp-brane sigma models is discussed in the literature in terms of light-cone gauge quantization.
This is actually how the Green-Schwarz superstring was first introduced in (Green-Schwarz 81, Green-Schwarz 82) before its generally covariant formulation was found in (Green-Schwarz 84). A textbook account of this is in (Green-Schwarz-Witten, section 5).
While, by the brane scan discussed above, the action functional for the Green-Schwarz superstring exists for target super Minkowski spacetimes of dimension d=3d = 3, 4, 6, and 10, its light-cone gauge quantization produces a quantum anomaly for the spacetime Lorentz group symmetry in dimension d=4d = 4 and d=6d = 6. For d=10d = 10 the anomaly disappears and the thus quantized Green-Schwarz string becomes equivalent to the quantum NSR string, hence to “the” critical string (of heterotic string theory, type II string theory).
Curiously, the light-cone gauge quantization of the GS-string also does wor however for d=3d = 3, see at super 1-brane in 3d for more on this.

Higher differential geometry is the incarnation of differential geometry in higher geometry. Hence it is concerned with n-groupoid-versions of smooth spaces for higher nn, where the traditional theory is contained in the case n=0n = 0. For n=1n = 1 these higher structures are Lie groupoids, differentiable stacks, their infinitesimal approximation by Lie algebroids and the generalization to smooth stacks. For higher nn this includes (deloopings of) Lie 2-groups, Lie 3-groups.
Fully generally, higher differential geometry hence replaces smooth manifolds (and possibly variants such as supermanifolds, formal manifolds, dg-manifolds etc.) by ∞-stacks ((∞,1)-sheaves) on the site of all such. Technically this means that higher differential geometry is the study of an (∞,1)-topos into which standard differential geometry faithfully embeds. This then allows to speak of smooth ∞-groups, Lie ∞-algebroids.
If the ambient (∞,1)-topos is not 1-localic (for instance over a genuine site of dg-manifolds) then one also speaks of derived differential geometry.
See at motivation for higher differential geometry for motivation.
The standard variants of differential geometry have their higher analogs, for instance symplectic geometry generalizes to higher symplectic geometry and prequantum geometry to higher prequantum geometry.
Higher geometry or homotopical geometry is the study of concepts of space and geometry in the context of higher category theory and homotopy theory.

Slogan
higher geometry = geometry + homotopy theory/higher category theory

Higher geometry subsumes notably the theory of orbifolds and geometric stacks, as well as the theory of more general stacks such as moduli stacks, and generalizes all this to ∞-stacks and derived stacks. This way higher geometry includes what is called derived geometry and it subsumes at least parts of (derived) noncommutative geometry. Many other phenomena are naturally part of higher geometry, see the list of Examples below.
In any given instance of higher geometry, one starts with a notion of “local models” for the geometry. An affine space will then be a formal dual of such a local model, and a general space will be formed by “gluing” these affine spaces in some appropriate way. There are two ways of formalizing this idea, coming from Alexander Grothendieck‘s two definitions of scheme in algebraic geometry via locally ringed spaces and functors of points. Both are built on (∞,1)-topos theory: in one direction, a petit (∞,1)-topos (with some additional structure) encodes a space itself; in another direction, a space is an object of a gros (∞,1)-topos of ∞-stacks on some (∞,1)-site. We discuss these axiomatizations below in Formalization.
These approaches do not apply to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which requires a different approach to deal with a more complicated notion of gluing; we discuss this below in Noncommutative algebraic geometry.

Noncommutative algebraic geometry
The above frameworks for higher geometry are not suitable for describing noncommutative algebraic geometry, because of the more complicated notions of localization, gluing and descent in the latter setting. Indeed, noncommutative spaces are supposed to be obtained from affine ones (formal duals of associative algebras or dg-algebras) by gluing along bimodules. A good setting for such gluing is that of pretriangulated dg-categories (or stable (∞,1)-categories). Thus in derived noncommutative algebraic geometry, a noncommutative space is defined to be a stable (∞,1)-category.
Connes-style noncommutative geometry
The process of forming groupoid convolution algebras is a 2-functor from suitable topological and differentiable stacks to C*-algebras with Hilbert bimodules between them. Much of Connes-style noncommutative geometry turns out to deal with objects in the image of this functor, and to the extent that it does, Connes-style noncommutative geometry may be regarded as being a way of speaking about higher geometry, specifically the higher differential geometry of differentiable stacks.
A site is a presentation of a sheaf topos as a structure freely generated under colimits from a category, subject to the relation that certain covering colimits are preserved.
As such, sites generalise topological spaces and locales, which present localic sheaf toposes. More precisely, sites generalise and categorify posites, which present localic toposes but also present locales themselves in a decategorified manner.
In technical terms, a site is a small category equipped with a coverage or Grothendieck topology. The category of sheaves over a site is a sheaf topos and the site is a site of definition for this topos.

Definition
A site (C,J)(C,J) is a category CC equipped with a coverage JJ.
For ℰ\mathcal{E} a topos equipped with an equivalence of categories
ℰ≃Sh(C,J)
  \mathcal{E} \simeq Sh(C,J)


to the sheaf topos over a site, one says that (C,J)(C,J) is a site of definition for ℰ\mathcal{E}.

Some classes of sites have their special names

Definition
A site is called


a small site, large site, essentially small site if the underlying category is a small category, large category, essentially small category, respectively;


a cartesian site if the underlying category is finitely complete (which the Elephant calls a cartesian category);


a standard site if it is a cartesian site equipped with a subcanonical coverage.



The term standard site appears in (Johnstone, example A2.1.11).

Remark
Often a site is required to be a small category. But also large sites play a role.


Remark
Every coverage induces a Grothendieck topology. Often sites are defined to be categories equipped with a Grothendieck topology. Some constructions and properties are more elegantly handled with coverages, some with Grothendieck topologies.
Notice that there are many equivalent ways to define a Grothendieck topology, for instance in terms of a system of local isomorphisms, or in terms of a system of dense monomorphisms in the category of presheaves PSh(S)PSh(S).


Definition
For (C,J)(C,J) a site, we write Sh J(C)Sh_J(C) for the category of sheaves on CC with respect to the coverage JJ.

Morita equivalent sites
Many inequivalent sites may have equivalent sheaf toposes.

Proposition
Every sheaf topos has a standard site of definition.

This appears as (Johnstone, theorem C2.2.8 (iii)).

Remark
By this corollary at classifying topos this means that every sheaf topos is the classifying topos for some theory of local algebras.

Subcanonical sites

Proposition
For ℰ\mathcal{E} a sheaf topos, the essentially small sites of definition (𝒞,J)(\mathcal{C}, J) of ℰ\mathcal{E} such that JJ is a subcanonical coverage are precisely the full subcategories on generating families of objects equipped with the coverages induced from the canonical coverage of ℰ\mathcal{E}.

This appears as (Johnstone, prop. C2.2.16).
Classically, we have:

A Grothendieck topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} is a category that admits a geometric embedding
𝒯↪←lexPSh(C)
  \mathcal{T} \stackrel{\stackrel{lex}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)


in a presheaf category, i.e., a full and faithful functor that has a left exact left adjoint.
This is equivalently the category of sheaves (Set-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a small site.

See at sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes for discussion of this characterization.
Since smallness can be relative, we also have:

For a given fixed category of sets SS, a Grothendieck topos over SS is a category of sheaves (SS-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a site which is small relative to SS, that is a site internal to SS.

Note that a Grothendieck topos is a topos because (or if) SS is.
The site is not considered part of the structure; different sites may give rise to equivalent category of sheaves.
By the general theory of geometric morphisms, every Grothendieck topos sits inside a category of presheaves by a geometric embedding Sh(S)↪PSh(S)Sh(S) \hookrightarrow PSh(S).


This may be taken as an alternative definition of sheaf: since Lawvere-Tierney topologies are bijectively given by geometric embeddings, instead of explicitly defining a sheaf as a presheaf satisfying descent, one may define categories of sheaves as geometric embeddings into presheaf categories.


For details on the relation between the two perspectives see geometric embedding.


This perspective is useful for defining the vertical categorification of sheaves: stacks and ∞-stacks: the higher categories of these may be defined as geometric embeddings into higher categories of presheaves. This has been worked out in detail for (∞,1)-categories. See (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves.


Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between petit topos and gros topos.


General

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a locally presentable category.

(Borceux 94, vol 3, prop. 3.4.16)

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a total category and a cototal category.


Proof
From the page total category, totality follows from the fact that a Grothendieck topos is

Cocomplete,
Well-copowered (because quotient objects of an object XX are in bijection with equivalence relations on XX, and there is a small set of these because a Grothendieck topos is well-powered), and
Has a generator (e.g., the coproduct of all representables for a small site presentation).

Dually, a Grothendieck topos is

Complete,
Well-powered (because subobjects of an object XX are in bijection with elements of a small hom-set hom(X,Ω)\hom(X, \Omega)), and
Has a cogenerator (e.g., the product of power objects Ω c\Omega^c where cc ranges over representables for a small site presentation).

Therefore a Grothendieck topos is also cototal.

Giraud's axiomatic characterization
Giraud characterized Grothendieck toposes as categories satisfying certain exactness and small completeness properties (where “small” is again relative to the given category of sets SS). The exactness properties are elementary (not depending on SS), and are satisfied in any elementary topos, or even a pretopos.
Giraud's theorem characterises a Grothendieck topos as follows:

a locally small category with a small generating set,
with all finite limits,
with all small coproducts, which are disjoint, and pullback-stable,
where all congruences have effective quotient objects, which are also pullback-stable.

These conditions are equivalent to

a locally small infinitary pretopos with a small generating set.

See the Elephant, theorem C.2.2.8. (There, the assumption of local smallness is not stated explicitly, but it is included in the definition of ∞\infty-pretopos by way of well-poweredness; on the nLab it is not so included, so we have to state it explicitly. To see that it is necessary, note that if UU and VV are Grothendieck universes with U∈VU\in V, then Set VSet_V satisfies all the other conditions relative to Set USet_U, but is not locally small and is not a Grothendieck topos.) See also Wikipedia.
Sometimes (3,4) are combined and strengthened to the statement that the category has all small colimits, which are effective and pullback-stable. However, this is a mistake for two reasons: it is a significantly stronger axiomatisation (since without the small generating set, not every infinitary pretopos has this property), and it is not valid in weak foundations (while the definition given above is).
Street’s axiomatic characterization
Augmenting the aforementioned Proposition  that Grothendieck toposes are total categories, Street more or less characterizes Grothendieck toposes as lex total categories having the same “size” as SetSet.
In more detail: we take as background set theory ZFC + “there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal” κ\kappa; equivalently, the existence of a single Grothendieck universe UU (a set of “small sets”). Supposing given a model VV of ZFC+universeZFC+universe, “category” shall then refer to category theory interpreted in VV. Let SetSet be the category of small sets; note that the set of morphisms of SetSet has size κ\kappa.
Recall that locally small category EE is lex total if the Yoneda embedding y:E→[E op,Set]y: E \to [E^{op}, Set] has a left exact left adjoint.

Theorem
(Street) A category EE is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is κ\kappa or less.


Remark
This result is in the spirit of saying “every Grothendieck topos is the category of sheaves with respect to the canonical topology on itself”. Putting aside set-theoretic issues, it suggests that Grothendieck toposes be seen as analogous to frames, which may be defined as lex total objects in 2\mathbf{2}-CatCat. In this setting, the appropriate morphisms are left exact left adjoints, so that Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms between them would be analogous to locales and continuous maps between them.
One can deduce formally that lex total categories are locally cartesian closed Heyting pretoposes.

As lex reflections of categories of presheaves
sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes
As localic groupoids
Every Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the classifying topos of a localic groupoid, every Grothendieck topos with enough points is equivalent to the classifying topos of a topological groupoid, and in fact the 2-category Topos of Grothendieck toposes is equivalent to a localization of that of localic groupoids.
See at classifying topos of a localic groupoid for more.
Internal logic
Being an elementary topos, a Grothendieck has an internal logic that can be taken to be higher-order logic or a form of dependent type theory. It is also useful to take its internal geometric logic, in particular because that is preserved by geometric morphisms and because every geometric theory has a Grothendieck classifying topos.
Although the internal logic of a Grothendieck topos is constructive logic, there are a number of principles that are true in every Grothendieck topos (at least, assuming the base topos Set is classical) but are not constructively provable (and in particular can fail in other toposes). Roughly speaking, many of these axioms assert that classicality fails “in only a small way”. These include:

WISC: every set has a weakly initial set of covers.
The (constructive) axiom of multiple choice (AMC).
The axiom of stack completions.
(allegedly) the local small cardinality selection axiom (SCSA).
Every complete small category is a preorder.

The notion of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves is the generalization of the notion of category of sheaves from category theory to the higher category theory of (∞,1)-categories.
Localizations and Grothendieck topology
We reproduce the proof that the two characterization in def.  above are indeed equivalent.

Proposition
For CC an (∞,1)-site, the full sub-(∞,1)-category of PSh(C)PSh(C) on local objects with respect to the covering monomorphisms in PSh(C)PSh(C) is indeed a topological localization, and hence Sh(C)Sh(C) is indeed an exact reflective sub-(∞,1)-category of PSh(C)PSh(C) and hence an (∞,1)-topos.

This is HTT, Prop. 6.2.2.7

Proof
We must prove that the (∞,1)-sheafification functor L:PSh(C)→Sh(C)L \colon PSh(C)\to Sh(C) preserves finite (∞,1)-limits. To do so we give an explicit construction of LL. Given a presheaf F∈PSh(C)F\in PSh(C), define a new presheaf F +F^+ by the formula
F +(c)=lim → Ulim ← u∈UF(u)F^+(c)={\lim_{\rightarrow}}_U {\lim_{\leftarrow}}_{u\in U} F(u)
where the colimit is taken over all covering sieves UU of cc; this is called the plus construction. It defines a functor PSh(C)→PSh(C)PSh(C)\to PSh(C) and there is an obvious morphism F→F +F\to F^+ natural in FF.
It is clear that the construction F↦F +F\mapsto F^+ preserves finite (∞,1)-limits, since filtered (∞,1)-colimits do, and it is easy to see that the map F→F +F\to F^+ becomes an equivalence in Sh(C)Sh(C). Given an ordinal α\alpha, let F (α)F^{(\alpha)} be the α\alpha-iteration of the plus construction applied to the presheaf FF. Then the functor F↦F (α)F\mapsto F^{(\alpha)} preserves finite limits and the canonical map F→F (α)F\to F^{(\alpha)} becomes an equivalence in Sh(C)Sh(C). In particular, if F (α)F^{(\alpha)} is a sheaf, then F (α)≃L(F)F^{(\alpha)}\simeq L(F). Thus, it suffices to show that there exists an ordinal α\alpha such that, for every F∈PSh(C)F\in PSh(C), F (α)F^{(\alpha)} is a sheaf.
Fix c∈Cc\in C and a covering sieve UU of CC. Given a presheaf G∈PSh(C/c)G\in PSh(C/c), we define an auxiliary presheaf Match(U,G)∈PSh(C/c)Match(U,G)\in PSh(C/c) by the formula
Match(U,G)(f:d→c)=lim ← u∈f *UG(u).Match(U,G)(f: d\to c)={\lim_{\leftarrow}}_{u\in f^\ast U}G(u).
Restriction maps induce a morphism θ G:G→Match(U,G)\theta_G: G\to Match(U,G). Since we clearly have G(u)→∼Match(U,G)(u)G(u)\stackrel{\sim}{\to} Match(U,G)(u) for u∈Uu\in U, the functor Match(U,−)Match(U,-) is idempotent in the sense that Match(U,θ G)Match(U,\theta_G) and θ Match(U,G)\theta_{Match(U,G)} are (equivalent) equivalences.
By definition, F∈PSh(C)F\in PSh(C) is a sheaf if and only if F(c)→∼Match(U,F| C/c)(c)F(c)\stackrel{\sim}{\to} Match(U,F|_{C/c})(c) for every c∈Cc\in C and every covering sieve UU of cc. Our goal is therefore to find an ordinal α\alpha (depending only on the (∞,1)-site CC) such that, for every F∈PSh(C)F\in PSh(C), the map
F (α)(c)→Match(U,F (α)| C/c)(c)F^{(\alpha)}(c) \to \Match(U,F^{(\alpha)}|_{C/c})(c)
is an equivalence.
The morphism G→G +G\to G^+ in PSh(C/c)PSh(C/c) factors as
G→Match(U,G)→G +.G\to Match(U,G)\to G^+.
Applying Match(U,−)Match(U,-) to this factorization, we get a commutative diagram
G → Match(U,G) → G + ↓ θ G  ↓ θ Match(U,G)  ↓ θ G + Match(U,G) → Match(U,Match(U,G)) → Match(U,G +)
  \array{
     G &\to& Match(U,G) &\to& G^+
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\theta_G}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\theta_{Match(U,G)}}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\theta_{G^+}}}
     \\
     Match(U,G) &\to& Match(U,Match(U,G)) &\to& Match(U,G^+)
  }


in which the map θ Match(U,G)\theta_{Match(U,G)} is an equivalence since Match(U,−)Match(U,-) is idempotent. By cofinality, the colimit of the maps θ G (n)\theta_{G^{(n)}} as n→∞n\to\infty is an equivalence. Applying this to G=F| C/cG=F|_{C/c}, we get
F (ω)(c)→∼lim → n→∞Match(U,F (n)| C/c)(c). F^{(\omega)}(c)\stackrel{\sim}{\to} {\lim_{\rightarrow}}_{n\to\infty} Match(U,F^{(n)}|_{C/c})(c).
This almost means that F (ω)F^{(\omega)} is a sheaf. The problem is that the filtered colimit on the right-hand side need not commute with the limit appearing in the definition of Match(U,−)Match(U,-), that is, the canonical map
lim → α<ωMatch(U,F (α)| C/c)(c)→Match(U,F (ω)| C/c)(c) {\lim_{\rightarrow}}_{\alpha \lt \omega} Match(U,F^{(\alpha)}|_{C/c})(c) \to \Match(U,F^{(\omega)}|_{C/c})(c) 
need not be an equivalence. To solve this problem, we choose a cardinal κ\kappa such that for every c∈Cc\in C and every covering sieve UU of cc, the functor Match(U,(−)| C/c)(c):Psh(C)→∞GrpdMatch(U,(-)|_{C/c})(c):Psh(C)\to \infty Grpd preserves κ\kappa-filtered colimits. This is possible because CC is small and each of these functors, being the composition of the restriction functor PSh(C)→PSh(U)PSh(C)\to PSh(U) and the limit functor PSh(U)→∞GrpdPSh(U)\to\infty Grpd, has a left adjoint (∞,1)-functor and is therefore accessible (see HTT Prop. 5.4.7.7). Then the above map with ω\omega replaced by κ\kappa is an equivalence. For every ordinal α<κ\alpha\lt\kappa, applying the above to F (α)F^{(\alpha)} shows that
F (α+ω)(c)→∼lim → n→∞Match(U,F (α+n)| C/c)(c), F^{(\alpha+\omega)}(c)\stackrel{\sim}{\to} {\lim_{\rightarrow}}_{n\to\infty} Match(U,F^{(\alpha+n)}|_{C/c})(c),
Since κ\kappa is a limit ordinal, we deduce that F (κ)F^{(\kappa)} is a sheaf by cofinality.

And conversely:

Proposition
(equivalence of site structures and categories of sheaves)
For CC a small (∞,1)-category, there is a bijective correspondence between structure of an (∞,1)-site on CC and equivalence classes of topological localizations of PSh(C)PSh(C).

This is HTT, prop. 6.2.2.9.

Lemma
For CC a small (∞,1)-site and Sh(C)↪←LPSh(C)Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{L}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow} PSh(C) the corressponding reflective inclusion of (∞,1)-sheaves into (∞,1)-presheaves on CC we have that the image under LL of a sub-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-functor p:U→j(c)p : U \to j(c) of a representable j(c)j(c) is covering precisely if L(p)L(p) is an equivalence.

This is HTT, lemma 6.2.2.8.

Proof of the Lemma
Since Sh(C)Sh(C) is the reflectuive localization of PSh(C)PSh(C) at covering monomorphisms, it is clear that if p:U→j(c)p : U \to j(c) is covering, then L(p)L(p) is an equivalence.
To see the converse, form the 0-truncation of LiL i and conclude as for ordinary sheaves on the homotopy catgegory of CC.
…


Proof of the Proposition
We have seen in (…) that for every structure of an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site on CC we obtain a topological localization of the presheaf category, and that this is an injective map from site structures to equivalence classes of sheaf categories. It remains to show that it is also a surjective map, i.e. that every topological localization of PSh(C)PSh(C) comes from the structure of an (∞,1)-site on CC.
So consider S⊂Mor(PSh(C))S \subset Mor(PSh(C)) a strongly saturated class of morphisms which s topological (closed under pullbacks). Write S 0⊂SS_0 \subset S for the subcalss of those that are monomorphisms of the form U→j(c)U \to j(c).
Observe that then SS is indeed generated by (is the smallest strongly saturated class containing) S 0S_0: since by the co-Yoneda lemma every object X∈PSh(C)X \in PSh(C) is a colimit x≃lim → kj(Ξ k)x \simeq {\lim_\to}_k j(\Xi_k) over representables. It follows that every monomorphism f:Y→Xf : Y \to X is a colimit (in Func(Δ[1],PSh(C))Func(\Delta[1],PSh(C))) of those of the form U→j(c)U \to j(c): for consider the pullback diagram
f *(lim → kΞ k) → Y ↓ ≃f  ↓ f lim → kΞ k →≃ X≃(lim → kf *Ξ k) → Y ↓ ≃f  ↓ f lim → kΞ k →≃ X
  \array{
     f^* ({\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k) &\to& Y 
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& X
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
     ({\lim_\to}_k f^* \Xi_k) &\to& Y 
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& X
  }


where the equivalence is due to the fact that we have universal colimits in PSh(C)PSh(C). This realizes ff as a colimit over morphisms of the form f *j(Ξ k)→j(Ξ k)f^* j(\Xi_k) \to j(\Xi_k) that are each a pullback of a monomorphism. Since monomorphisms are stable under pullback (see monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category for details), all these component morphisms are themselves monomorphisms.
So every monomorphism in SS is generated from S 0S_0, but by the assumption that SS is topological, it is itself entirely generated from monomorphisms, hence is generated from S 0S_0.
So far this establishes that evry topological localization of PSh(C)PSh(C) is a localization at a collection of sieves/ subfunctors U→j(c)U \to j(c) of representables. It remains to show that this collection of subfunctors is indeed an Grothendieck topology and hence exhibits on CC the structure of an (∞,1)-site. We check the necessary three axioms:


equivalences cover – The equivalences j(c)→≃j(c)j(c) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} j(c) belong to SS and are monomorphisms, hence belong to S 0S_0.


pullback of a cover is covering - Since monomorphisms are stable under pullback, we haave for every p:U→j(c)p : U \to j(c) in SS and every j(f):j(d)→j(c)j(f) : j(d) \to j(c) that also the pullback f *pf^* p
f *U → U ↓ f *p  ↓ p j(d) →f j(c)

     f^* U &\to& U

     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f^* p}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
     \\
     j(d) &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }


is a monomorphism and in SS, hence in S 0S_0.


if restriction of a sieve to a cover is covering, then the sieve is covering – Let p:U→j(c)p : U \to j(c) be an arbitrary monomorphism and f:X→j(d)f : X \to j(d) in S 0S_0. Write X≃lim → kΞ kX \simeq {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k and consider the pullback
lim → kp *Ξ k →p *f U ↓ lim → kf k *p  ↓ p lim → kΞ k →f j(c),
  \array{
    {\lim_\to}_k p^* \Xi_k &\stackrel{p^* f}{\to}&  U
    \\
    \downarrow^{{\lim_\to}_k f_k^* p} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    {\lim_\to}_k \Xi_k &\stackrel{f}{\to}& j(c)
  }
  \,,


where again we made use of the universal colimits in PSh(C)PSh(C). Now notice that


ff is in SS by assumption;


p *fp^* f is by pullback stability of SS;


each of the f kpf_k p is in SS by assumption, hence lim kf k *p{\lim_k f_k^* p} is by the fact that SS is strongly saturated.


so by commutativity p∘p *fp \circ p^*f is in SS.


finally by 2-out-of-3 this means that pp is in SS.





Over paracompact topological spaces
We discuss how (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves over a paracompact topological space are equivalent to topological spaces over XX. This is the analogue of the 1-categorical statement that sheaves on XX are equivalent to etale spaces over XX: an etale space over XX is one whose fibers are discrete topological space, hence 0-truncated spaces. The n-category analogy has homotopy n-types as fibers.

Definition
For Y→XY \to X a morphism in Top, and U∈Op(X)U \in Op(X) an open subset of XX, write
Sing X(Y,U):=Hom X(U×Δ •,X)
  Sing_X(Y,U) := Hom_X(U \times \Delta^\bullet, X)


for the simplicial set (in fact a Kan complex) of continuous maps
U×Δ k  →  Y  ↘  ↙   X
  \array{
    U \times \Delta^k && \to && Y
    \\
    & \searrow && \swarrow
    \\
    && X
  }


from UU times the topological kk-simplex Δ k\Delta^k into YY, that are sections of Y→XY \to X.

This is a relative version of the singular simplicial complex functor.

Proposition
Let (X,ℬ)(X, \mathcal{B}) be a topological space equipped with a base for the topology ℬ\mathcal{B}.
There is a model category structure on the over category Top/XTop/X with weak equivalences and fibration precisely those morphisms Y→ZY \to Z over XX such that for each U∈ℬU \in \mathcal{B} the induced morphism Sing X(Y,U)→Sing X(Z,U)Sing_X(Y,U) \to Sing_X(Z,U) is a weak equivalence or fibration, respectively, in the standard model structure on simplicial sets.

This is HTT, prop 7.1.2.1.
Write (Top/X) ∘(Top/X)^\circ for the (∞,1)-category presented by this model structure.

Proposition
Let XX be a paracompact topological space and write as usual Sh (∞,1)(X):=Sh (∞,1)(Op(X))Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Op(X)) for the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves on the category of open subsets of XX; equipped with the canonical structure of a site.
Let ℬ\mathcal{B} be the set of F σF_\sigma-open subsets of XX. This are those open subsets that are countable unions of closed subsets, equivalently the 0-sets of continuous functions X→[0,1]X \to [0,1].
Let Top/X ∘Top/X^\circ be the corresponding (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categoty according to the above proposition. Then Sing X(−,−)Sing_X(-,-) constitutes an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
Top/X ∘≃Sh (∞,1)(X).
  Top/X^\circ \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
  \,.


This is HTT, corollary 7.1.4.4.
Difference to more general (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
The (∞,1)-toposes that are (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories of sheaves, i.e. that arise by topological localization from an (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves, enjoy a number of special properties over other classes of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes, such as notably hypercomplete (∞,1)-toposes.
The following lists these properties. (HTT, section 6.5.4.)
Universal property
The construction of (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes on a given locale is singled out over the construction of other kinds of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes (such as hypercomplete (∞,1)-toposes) by the following universal property:
forming (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves is, roughly, right adjoint to the functor τ ≤−1\tau_{\leq -1} that sends each (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos to its underlying locale of subobjects of the terminal object.
See HTT, item 1) of section 6.5.4.
For X,YX,Y two (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes, write Geom(X,Y)⊂Func(X,Y)Geom(X,Y) \subset Func(X,Y) for the full sub-(∞,1)-category of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-functors on those that are geometric morphisms.

Lemma
For CC an small (n,1)-category with finite (∞,1)-limits and equipped with the structure of an (∞,1)-site and for YY an (∞,1)-topos, the truncation functor
τ ≤n−1:Geom(Y,Sh(C))→Geom(τ ≤n−1Y,τ ≤n−1Sh(C))
  \tau_{\leq n-1} : 
  Geom(Y, Sh(C)) \to Geom(\tau_{\leq n-1} Y, \tau_{\leq n-1} Sh(C))


is an equivalence (of (∞,1)-categories).

This is HTT, lemma 6.4.5.6.
See also n-localic (∞,1)-topos.
Compact generation

Proposition
Let XX be a coherent topological space and let Op(X)Op(X) be its category of open subsets with the standard structure of an (∞,1)-site.
Then Sh (∞,1)(X):=Sh (∞,1)(Op(X))Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Op(X)) is compactly generated in that it is generated by filtered colimits of compact objects.
Moreover, the compact objects of Sh (∞,1)(X)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) are those that are stalkwise compact objects in ∞Grpd and locally constant along a suitable stratification of XX.

This is HTT, prop. 6.5.4.4.
This statement is false for the hypercompletion of Sh (∞,1)(X)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X), in general.
Nonabelian cohomology
For XX a topological space, let
(LConst⊣Γ):Sh (∞,1)(X)→Γ←LConst
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) :  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
  \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}


be the global sections terminal geometric morphism.
For A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd, the (nonabelian) cohomology of XX with coefficients in AA is usually defined in ∞Grpd as
H(X,A):=π 0Func(SingX,A),
  H(X,A) := \pi_0 Func(Sing X, A)
  \,,


where SingXSing X is the fundamental ∞-groupoid of XX. On the other hand, if we send AA into Sh (∞,1)(X)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) via LConstLConst, the there is the intrinsic cohomology of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos Sh (∞,1)(X)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)
H′(X,A):=π 0Sh (∞,1)(X)(X,LConstA).
  H'(X,A) := \pi_0 Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X, LConst A)
  \,.


Noticing that XX is in fact the terminal object of Sh (∞,1)(X)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X) and that Sh (∞,1)(X)(X,−)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,-) is in fact that global sections functor, this is equivalently
⋯≃π 0ΓLConstA.
  \cdots \simeq \pi_0 \Gamma LConst A
  \,.



Theorem
If XX is a paracompact space, then these two definitions of nonabelian cohomology of XX with constant coefficients A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd agree:
H(X,A):=π 0∞Grpd(SingX,A)≃Sh (∞,1)(X)(X,LConstA).
  H(X,A) := \pi_0 \infty Grpd(Sing X,A)  \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(X)(X,LConst A)
  \,.


This is HTT, theorem 7.1.0.1.
The terminal category or trivial category or final category is the terminal object in Cat. It is the unique (up to isomorphism) category with a single object and a single morphism, necessarily the identity morphism on that object. It is often denoted 11 or 1\mathbf{1} or *\ast.
In enriched category theory, often instead of the terminal category one is interested in the unit enriched category.
A functor from the terminal category 11 to any category CC is equivalently an object of CC. More generally, the functor category [1,C]≃C[1, C] \simeq C from the terminal category to CC is canonically equivalent (in fact, isomorphic) to the category CC itself.
The terminal category is a discrete category that, as a set, may be called the singleton. As a subset of the singleton, it is in fact a truth value, true (⊤\top). In general, all of these (and their analogues in higher category theory and homotopy theory) may be called the point.
So far we have interpreted “terminal” as referring to the 1-category CatCat. If instead we interpret “terminal” in the 2-categorical sense, then any category equivalent to the one-object-one-morphism category described above is also terminal. A category is terminal in this sense precisely when it is inhabited and indiscrete. For such a category 11, the functor category [1,C][1,C] is equivalent, but not isomorphic, to CC.

Proposition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a category.


The following are equivalent:


𝒞\mathcal{C} has a terminal object;


the unique functor 𝒞→*\mathcal{C} \to \ast to the terminal category has a right adjoint
*⊥⟶⟵𝒞
  \ast 
 \underoverset
 {\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}
 {\overset{}{\longleftarrow}}
 {\bot}
  \mathcal{C}



Under this equivalence, the terminal object is identified with the image under the right adjoint of the unique object of the terminal category.


Dually, the following are equivalent:


𝒞\mathcal{C} has an initial object;


the unique functor 𝒞→*\mathcal{C} \to \ast to the terminal category has a left adjoint
𝒞⊥⟶⟵*
  \mathcal{C}
 \underoverset
 {\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}
 {\overset{}{\longleftarrow}}
 {\bot}
  \ast



Under this equivalence, the initial object is identified with the image under the left adjoint of the unique object of the terminal category.




Proof
Since the unique hom-set in the terminal category is the singleton, the hom-isomorphism characterizing the adjoint functors is directly the universal property of an initial object in 𝒞\mathcal{C}
Hom 𝒞(L(*),X)≃Hom *(*,R(X))=*
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( L(\ast) , X )
  \;\simeq\;
  Hom_{\ast}( \ast, R(X) ) 
  =
  \ast 


or of a terminal object
Hom 𝒞(X,R(*))≃Hom *(L(X),*)=*,
  Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( X , R(\ast) )
  \;\simeq\;
  Hom_{\ast}( L(X), \ast ) = \ast
  \,,


respectively.

SetSet is the (or a) category with sets as objects and functions between sets as morphisms.
This definition is somewhat vague by design. Rather than canonize a fixed set of principles, the nLab adopts a ‘pluralist’ point of view which recognizes different needs and foundational assumptions among mathematicians who use set theory. Thus, there are various axes to consider when formulating categorical properties one thinks SetSet should satisfy, including


first-order vs. higher-order logic


impredicative vs. predicative mathematics


‘variability’ vs. ‘constancy’ (Lawvere)


classical logic vs. intuitionistic logic


image factorizations and quotient sets, i.e. sets vs setoids.


initial and free structures, i.e. transfinite construction of free algebras/quotient inductive types


choice principles


replacement or collection principles


smallness structures


just to name a few. Quite a bit of axiomatic fine-tuning can enter when one considers the panoply of hypotheses that might appeal to one or another school of intuitionism or constructivism, or various combinatorial or cardinal hypotheses one might attach to ZFC, etc.
Characterization
The category SetSet has many marvelous properties, which make it a common choice for serving as a ‘foundation’ of mathematics. For instance:


It is a well-pointed topos,
So in particular it is locally cartesian closed.


It is  locally small.


It is complete and cocomplete, and therefore ∞\infty-extensive (as is any cocomplete topos).


At least assuming classical logic, these properties suffice to characterize SetSet uniquely up to equivalence among all categories; see cocomplete well-pointed topos. Note, however, that the definitions of “locally small” and “(co)complete” presuppose a notion of small and therefore a knowledge of what a set (as opposed to a proper class) is.
As a groupoid, SetSet is characterized by the fact that

SetSet is the discrete object classifier in the category Grpd of groupoids and functors, playing a similar role in classifying discrete groupoids in GrpdGrpd that the set of truth values Ω\Omega does in classifying subsets in SetSet. The morphism F:I→SetF:I \rightarrow Set is an indexed family of sets and II is an index groupoid.

As a topos, SetSet is also characterized by the fact that

SetSet is the terminal object in the category of Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms. The terminal morphism Γ:E→Set\Gamma\colon E \to Set from any other topos EE is the global sections functor.

It is usually assumed that SetSet satisfies the axiom of choice and has a natural numbers object. In Lawvere’s theory ETCS, which can serve as a foundation for much of mathematics, SetSet is asserted to be a well-pointed topos that satisfies the axiom of choice and has a natural numbers object. It follows that it is automatically “locally small” and “complete and cocomplete” relative to the notion of “smallness” defined in terms of itself (actually, this is true for any topos).
Conversely, Set\Set in constructive mathematics cannot satisfy the axiom of choice (since this implies excluded middle), although constructivists might accept COSHEP (that SetSet has enough projectives). In predicative mathematics, Set\Set is not even a topos, although most predicativists would still agree that it is a pretopos, and predicativists of the constructive school would even agree that it is a locally cartesian closed pretopos.
Size
Above we considered SetSet to be the category of all sets, so that in particular SetSet itself is a large category. Authors who assume a Grothendieck universe as part of their foundations often define SetSet to be the category of small sets (those contained in the universe). One often then writes SETSET for the category of large sets, which is the universe enlargement of SetSet.
Opposite category and Boolean algebras

Proposition
The power set-functor
𝒫:Set→Bool op
  \mathcal{P} \;\colon\; Set \to Bool^{op}


is a faithful functor which in its (eso+full, faithful) factorization induces an equivalence of categories between SetSet and the opposite category of that of complete atomic Boolean algebras.

See for instance van Oosten, theorem 2.4

Remark
Restricted to FinSet this equivalence restricts to an equivalence with finite Boolean algebras. See at Stone duality for more on this.


Remark
In constructive mathematics, 𝒫\mathcal{P} defines an equivalence of Set\Set with the opposite category of that of complete atomic Heyting algebras. In fact, for any elementary topos ℰ\mathcal{E}, the power object functor defines an equivalence of ℰ\mathcal{E} with the opposite category of that of internal complete atomic Heyting algebras. (This phrase can be interpreted using the internal language of ℰ\mathcal{E}.)

The term discrete ∞\infty-groupoid or bare ∞\infty-groupoid or geometrically discrete geometric homotopy type is essentially synonymous to just ∞-groupoid or just homotopy type. It is used for emphasis in contexts where one considers ∞\infty-groupoids with extra geometric structure (e.g. cohesive structure) to indicate that this extra structure is being disregarded, or rather that the special case of discrete such structure is considered.

Observation
The terminal (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos ∞Grpd is trivially a cohesive (∞,1)-topos, where each of the defining four (∞,1)-functors (Π⊣Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):∞Grpd→∞Grpd(\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : \infty Grpd \to \infty Grpd is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories.


Definition
In the context of cohesive (∞,1)-toposes we say that ∞Grpd defines discrete cohesion and refer to its objects as discrete ∞\infty-groupoids.
More generally, given any other cohesive (∞,1)-topos
(Π⊣Disc⊣Γ⊣codisc):H→Γ←Disc∞Grpd
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv codisc) : \mathbf{H}  \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}}
  \infty Grpd


the inverse image DiscDisc of the global section functor is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor and hence embeds ∞Grpd as a full sub-(∞,1)-category of H\mathbf{H}. A general object in H\mathbf{H} is a cohesive ∞\infty-groupoid . We say X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} is a discrete ∞\infty-groupoid if it is in the image of DiscDisc.


Remark
This generalizes the traditional use of the terms discrete space and discrete group:


a discrete space is equivalently a 0-truncated discrete ∞\infty-groupoid;


a discrete group is equivalently a 0-truncated group object in discrete ∞\infty-groupoids.




Definition
Write CartSpCartSp for the category whose


objects are Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N};


morphisms are suitable structure-preserving functions between these spaces.


For definiteness we write
CartSp linCartSp_{lin} for the category whose objects are Cartesian spaces regarded as real vector spaces and whose morphisms are linear functions between these;


CartSp topCartSp_{top} for the category whose objects are Cartesian spaces regarded as topological spaces equipped with their Euclidean topology and morphisms are continuous maps between them.


CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} for the category whose objects are Cartesian spaces regarded as smooth manifolds with their standard smooth structure and morphisms are smooth functions.



As a small category of objects with a basis
A Cartesian space carries a lot of structure, for instance CartSp may be naturally regarded as a full subcategory of the category CC, for CC (any one of) the category of

vector spaces,
affine spaces,
normed vector spaces,
inner product spaces,
Euclidean spaces.

In all these cases, the inclusion CartSp↪CCartSp \hookrightarrow C is an equivalence of categories: choosing an isomorphism from any of these objects to a Cartesian space amounts to choosing a basis of a vector space, a coordinate system.
As a site

Definition
Write


CartSp top{}_{top} for the category whose objects are Cartesian spaces and whose morphisms are all continuous maps between these.


CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} for the category whose objects are Cartesian spaces and whose morphisms are all smooth functions between these.


CartSp synthdiff{}_{synthdiff} for the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on those of the form ℝ n×D\mathbb{R}^n \times D for DD an infinitesimal space (the formal dual of a Weil algebra).




Proposition
In all three cases there is the good open cover coverage that makes CartSp a site.


Proof
For CartSp top{}_{top} this is obvious. For CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} this is somewhat more subtle. It is a folk theorem (see the references at open ball). A detailed proof is at good open cover. This directly carries over to CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proposition


The site CartSp topCartSp_{top} is a dense subsite of the site of paracompact topological manifolds with the open cover coverage.


The site CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} is a dense subsite of the site Diff of paracompact smooth manifolds equipped with the open cover coverage.




Proposition
Equipped with this structure of a site, CartSp is an ∞-cohesive site.

The corresponding cohesive topos of sheaves is


Sh (1,1)(CartSp smooth)Sh_{(1,1)}(CartSp_{smooth}), discussed at diffeological space.


Sh (1,1)(CartSp synthdiff)Sh_{(1,1)}(CartSp_{synthdiff}), discussed at Cahiers topos.


The corresponding cohesive (∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves is


Sh (∞,1)(CartSp top)=Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{top}) = ETop∞Grpd;


Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth)=Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth}) = Smooth∞Grpd;


Sh (∞,1)(CartSp synthdiff)=Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{synthdiff}) = SynthDiff∞Grpd;



Corollary
We have equivalences of categories


Sh(CartSp top)≃Sh(TopMfd)Sh(CartSp_{top}) \simeq Sh(TopMfd)


Sh(CartSp smooth)≃Sh(Diff)Sh(CartSp_{smooth}) \simeq Sh(Diff)


and equivalences of (∞,1)-categories


Sh (∞,1)(CartSp top)≃Sh (∞,1)(TopMfd)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{top}) \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(TopMfd);


Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth)≃Sh (∞,1)(Diff)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth}) \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(Diff).




Proof
The first two statements follow by the above proposition with the comparison lemma discussed at dense sub-site.
For the second condition notice that since an ∞-cohesive site is in particular an ∞-local site we have that Sh (∞,1)(CartSp)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp) is a local (∞,1)-topos. As discussed there, this implies that it is a hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos. By the discussion at model structure on simplicial presheaves this means that it is presented by the Joyal-Jardine-model structure on simplicial sheaves Sh(CartSp) loc Δ opSh(CartSp)^{\Delta^{op}}_{loc}. The claim then follows with the first two statements.

As a category with open maps
There is a canonical structure of a category with open maps on CartSpCartSp (…)
As an algebraic theory
The category CartSpCartSp is (the syntactic category of ) a Lawvere theory: the theory for smooth algebras.
As a pre-geometry
Equipped with the above coverage-structure, open map-structure and Lawvere theory-property, CartSpCartSp is essentially a pregeometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes).
(Except that the pullback stability of the open maps holds only in the weaker sense of coverages).
(…)
\,
The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd

  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd

  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.

Der unendlich kleinste Theil des Raumes ist immer ein Raum, etwas, das Continuität hat, nicht aber ein blosser Punct, oder die Grenze zwischen bestimmten Stellen im Raume; (Fichte 1795, Grundriss, §4.IV)

In synthetic differential geometry one formulates differential geometry axiomatically in toposes – called smooth toposes – of generalized smooth spaces by assuming the explicit existence of infinitesimal neighbourhoods of points.
The main point of the axioms is to ensure that a well defined notion of infinitesimal spaces exists in the topos, whose existence concretely and usefully formalizes the wide-spread but often vague intuition about the role of infinitesimals in differential geometry.
In particular, in such toposes EE there exists an infinitesimal space DD that behaves like the infinitesimal interval in such a way that for any space X∈EX \in E the tangent bundle of XX, is, again as an object of the topos, just the internal hom TX:=X DT X \;\text{:=}\; X^D (using the notation of exponential objects in the cartesian closed category EE). So a tangent vector in this context is literally an infinitesimal path in XX.
This way, in smooth toposes it is possible to give precise well-defined meaning to many of the familiar computations – wide-spread in particular in the physics literature – that compute with supposedly “infinitesimal” quantities.

Remark
As quoted by Anders Kock in his first book (p. 9), Sophus Lie – one of the founding fathers of differential geometry and, of course Lie theory – once said that he found his main theorems in Lie theory using “synthetic reasoning”, but had to write them up in non-synthetic style (see analytic versus synthetic) just due to lack of a formalized language:

“The reason why I have postponed for so long these investigations, which are basic to my other work in this field, is essentially the following. I found these theories originally by synthetic considerations. But I soon realized that, as expedient ( zweckmässig ) the synthetic method is for discovery, as difficult it is to give a clear exposition on synthetic investigations, which deal with objects that till now have almost exclusively been considered analytically. After long vacillations, I have decided to use a half synthetic, half analytic form. I hope my work will serve to bring justification to the synthetic method besides the analytical one.” (Sophus Lie, Allgemeine Theorie der partiellen Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung, Math. Ann. 9 (1876).)


Synthetic differential geometry provides this formalized language.

Remark
Another advocate of the use of infinitesimals in the late 19th century was the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce:

The illumination of the subject by a strict notation for the logic of relatives had shown me clearly and evidently that the idea of an infinitesimal involves no contradiction…As a mathematician, I prefer the method of infinitesimals to that of limits, as far easier and less infested with snares. Charles Sanders Peirce, The Law of Mind, The Monist 2 (1892)

According to Bell (1998, p.5):

Peirce was aware, even before Brouwer, that a faithful account of the truly continuous will involve jettisoning the law of excluded(.)


A site of formal Cartesian spaces.

Definition
Let FormalCartSpFormalCartSp (or FormalCartSpFormalCartSp) be the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on those of the form
ℝ n×ℓW,
  \mathbb{R}^n \times \ell W
  \,,


consisting of a product of a Cartesian space with an infinitesimally thickened point, i.e. a formal dual of a Weil algebra .
Dually, the opposite category is the full subcategory FormalCartSp op↪SmoothAlgFormalCartSp^{op} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg of smooth algebras on those of the form
C ∞(ℝ k×ℓW)=C ∞(ℝ k)⊗W.
  C^\infty( \mathbb{R}^k \times \ell W)
  = 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k) \otimes W
  \,.


This appears for instance in Kock Reyes (1).

Definition
Define a structure of a site on FormalCartSp by declaring a covering family to be a family of the form
{U i×ℓW→p i×IdU×ℓW}
  \{
    U_i \times \ell W \stackrel{p_i \times Id}{\to} U \times \ell W
  \}


where {U i→p iU}\{U_i \stackrel{p_i}{\to} U\} is an open cover of the Cartesian space UU by Cartesian spaces U iU_i.

This appears as Kock (5.1).

Definition
The Cahiers topos 𝒞𝒯\mathcal{CT} is the category of sheaves on this site:
𝒞𝒯:=Sh(FormalCartSp).
  \mathcal{CT} := Sh(FormalCartSp)  
  \,.


This site of definition appears in Kock, Reyes. The original definition is due to Dubuc

Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves over FormalCartSpFormalCartSp is that of formal smooth ∞-groupoids

  \,.


\,
The concept of formal smooth set is a kind of generalized space generalizing smooth sets from plain differential geometry to differential geometry equipped with explicit infinitesimal spaces, hence to synthetic differential geometry. Just as a smooth set is equivalently a sheaf on the site of Cartesian spaces, so a formal smooth set is a sheaf on the site of formal Cartesian spaces, hence of Cartesian products of Cartesian spaces with infinitesimally thickened points. The resulting sheaf topos is also known as Dubuc’s Cahiers topos.
For the moment, for more see at geometry of physics the chapters manifolds and orbifolds and geometry of physics – supergeometry.
A formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with a cohesive structure that subsumes that of smooth ∞-groupoids as well as of infinitesimal ∞\infty-groupoids – ∞-Lie algebroids, hence equipped with “differential cohesion”.
In the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids the canonical fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos Π(X)\mathbf{\Pi}(X) factors through a version relative to Smooth∞Grpd: the infinitesimal path ∞-functor Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X). In traditional terms this is the object modeled by the tangent Lie algebroid and the de Rham space of XX. The quasicoherent ∞-stacks on Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) are D-modules on XX.
We consider (∞,1)-sheaves over a “twisted semidirect product” site or (∞,1)-site of


Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them as for smooth ∞-groupoids,


and a category or (∞,1)-category of infinitesimally thickened points.


First in

1-localic definition

we consider the 1-site, then in

∞-localic definition

we consider the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site.
1-localic definition

Definition
Let T:=T :=  CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the syntactic category of the Lawvere theory of smooth algebras: the category of Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and smooth functions between them.
Write
SmoothAlg:=TAlg
  SmoothAlg := T Alg


for its category of T-algebras – the smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings).
Let
InfPoint↪SmoothAlg op
  InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}


be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points: this smooth algebras whose underlying abelian group is a vector space of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R} \oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional real vector space and nilpotent in the algebra structure.


Definition
Let
FormalCartSp↪SmoothLoc
  FormalCartSp \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


be the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on the objects of the form
U=ℝ n×D
  U = \mathbb{R}^n \times D


that are products of a Cartesian space ℝ n∈\mathbb{R}^n \in CartSp for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and an infinitesimally thickened point D∈InfPointD \in InfPoint. (See at FormalCartSp.)
Equip this category with the coverage where a family of morphisms is covering precisely if it is of the form {U i×D→(f i,Id D)U×D}\{U_i \times D \stackrel{(f_i, Id_D)}{\to} U \times D\} for {f i:U i→U}\{f_i : U_i \to U\} a covering in CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} (a good open cover).

This appears as ([Kock 86, (5.1)]).

Note
The sheaf topos over FormalCartSp is (equivalent to) the topos known as the Cahiers topos, a smooth topos that constitutes a well adapted model for synthetic differential geometry. See at Cahiers topos for further references.


Definition
We say the (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves
FormalSmooth∞Grpd:=Sh (∞,1)(FormalCartSp)
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FormalCartSp)


on FormalCartSpFormalCartSp.

∞\infty-localic
We now generalize the 1-category InfPointInfPoint of infinitesimally thickened points to the (∞,1)-category InfPoint ∞InfPoint_\infty of “derived infinitesimally thickened points”, the formal dual of “small commutative ∞\infty-algebras” from (Hinich, Lurie).
(…)

Proposition
FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
Because FormalCartSp is an ∞-cohesive site. See there for details.


Definition
Write FormalSmoothMfd↪SmoothAlg opFormalSmoothMfd \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} for the full subcategory of smooth loci on the formal smooth manifolds: those modeled on FormalCartSp equipped with the evident coverage.


Observation
FormalCartSpFormalCartSp is a dense sub-site of FormalSmoothMfdFormalSmoothMfd.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(FSmoothMfd)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FSmoothMfd)


with the hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos over FSmoothMfdFSmoothMfd.


Proof
With the above observation this is directly analogous to the corresponding proof at ETop∞Grpd.


Definition
Write i:CartSp smooth↪FormalCartSpi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow FormalCartSp for the canonical embedding.


Proposition
The functor i *i^* given by restriction along ii exhibits FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth\infty Grpd as an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids in that we have a quadruple of adjoint (∞,1)-functors
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd←i !→i *←i *↪i !FormalSmooth∞Grpd,
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd
  \,,


such that i !i_! is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor.


Proof
Since i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp formalsmoothi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{formalsmooth} is an infinitesimally ∞-cohesive site this follows with a proposition discussed at cohesive (infinity,1)-topos – infinitesimal cohesion.

Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
For more see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Supergeometry may defined over an arbitrary commutative ring (Schwarz and Shapiro 06).
The analog of a Cartesian space in supergeometry, a supermanifold with a single canonical coordinate chart.
For suitable even|odd dimension this is naturally equipped with the structure of a supergroup that makes it a super-translation group. For Minkowski signature this is super-Minkowski spacetime.
For p,q∈ℕp,q \in \mathbb{N}, let ℝ p|q\mathbb{R}^{p|q} the super Cartesian space of dimension_ (p|q)(p|q). This is the supermanifold defined by the fact that its algebra of functions is freely generated, as a smooth superalgebra by even-graded coordinate-functions ⟨{x a} 1 p\langle \{x^a\}_{1}^p and odd-graded coordinate function {θ α} α=1 q\{ \theta^\alpha\}_{\alpha= 1}^q. Equivalently this is the tensor product of the smooth functions on ℝ p\mathbb{R}^p with the real Grassmann algebra on qq generators:
C ∞(ℝ p|q) ≔⟨{x a} 1 p,{θ α} α=1 q⟩  =C ∞(ℝ p)⊗ ℝ∧ •ℝ q.
  \begin{aligned}
      C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) 
      & \coloneqq 
      \langle \{x^a\}_{1}^p, \{ \theta^\alpha\}_{\alpha= 1}^q \rangle
      \\
      & = C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^p)\otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \wedge^\bullet \mathbb{R}^q
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


De Rham complex of differential forms
We discuss the de Rham complex of super differential forms on a super Cartesian space. (See also at signs in supergeometry.)
Accordingly, by the discussion at Kähler forms, the de Rham complex of super differential forms on ℝ p|q\mathbb{R}^{p|q} is freely generated as a super-module over the smooth superalgebra C ∞(ℝ p|q)C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) by expressions of the form dx a 1∧⋯∧dx a k∧dθ α 1∧⋯∧dθ α l\mathbf{d}x^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathbf{d}x^{a_k} \wedge \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_l}.
Ω •(ℝ p|q)=C ∞(ℝ p|q)[{dx a 1∧⋯∧dx a k∧dθ α 1∧⋯∧dθ α l}].
  \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
  = 
  C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^{p|q})
  \left[
   \left\{
     \mathbf{d}x^{a_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathbf{d}x^{a_k} 
     \wedge 
     \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_l}
   \right\}
  \right]
  \,.


This de Rham complex now carries the structure of a

differential graded-commutative graded commutative superalgebra

which should be thought of as bracketet as follows

differential graded-commutative graded (commutative superalgebra).

This means in effect that elements of Ω •(ℝ p|q)\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) carry a ℤ×ℤ 2\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_2-grading, where we may say that


ℤ\mathbb{Z} corresponds to the “cohomological grading”;


ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2 corresponds to the super-grading.


We write
(n,σ)∈ℤ×ℤ 2
  (n,\sigma)\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_2


for elements in this grading group.
In this notation the grading of the elements in Ω •(ℝ p|q)\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) is all induced by the fact that the de Rham differential d\mathbf{d} itself is a derivation of degree (1,even)(1,even).
generatorbi-degreex ax^a(0,even)
θ α\theta^\alpha(0,odd)
d\mathbf{d}(1,even)

Here the last line means that we have
generatorbi-degreex ax^a(0,even)
θ α\theta^\alpha(0,odd)
dx a\mathbf{d}x^a(1,even)
dθ α\mathbf{d}\theta^\alpha(1,odd)

The formula for the “cohomologically- and super-graded commutativity” in Ω •(ℝ p|q)\Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) is
α∧β=(−1) n αn β+σ ασ ββ∧α
  \alpha \wedge \beta 
  = 
  \;
  (- 1)^{n_\alpha n_\beta + \sigma_\alpha \sigma_\beta}
  \;
  \beta \wedge \alpha


for all α,β∈Ω •(ℝ p|q)\alpha,  \beta \in \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb{R}^{p|q}) of homogeneous ℤ×ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}_2-degree. Hence there are two contributions to the sign picked up when exchanging two super-differential forms in the wedge product:


there is a “cohomological sign” which for commuting a p 1p_1-forms past a p 2p_2-form is (−1) p 1p 2(-1)^{p_1 p_2};


in addition there is a “super-grading” sich which for commuting a σ 1\sigma_1-graded coordinate function past a σ 2\sigma_2-graded coordinate function (possibly under the de Rham differential) is (−1) σ 1σ 2(-1)^{\sigma_1 \sigma_2}.


Some examples:
x a 1(dx a 2)=+(dx a 2)x a 1
  x^{a_1} (\mathbf{d}x^{a_2}) = + (\mathbf{d}x^{a_2}) x^{a_1}


θ α(dx a)=+(dx a)θ α
  \theta^\alpha (\mathbf{d}x^a) = + (\mathbf{d}x^a) \theta^\alpha


θ α 1(dθ α 2)=−(dθ α 2)θ α 1
  \theta^{\alpha_1} (\mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_2}) 
   = 
  - (\mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_2}) \theta^{\alpha_1}


dx a 1∧dx a 2=−dx a 2∧dx a 1
  \mathbf{d}x^{a_1}
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} x^{a_2}
  =
  -
  \mathbf{d} x^{a_2}
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} x^{a_1}


dx a∧dθ α=−dθ α∧dx a
  \mathbf{d}x^a
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} \theta^{\alpha}
  =
  -
  \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha}
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} x^a


dθ α 1∧dθ α 2=+dθ α 2∧dθ α 1
  \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_1}
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} \theta^{\alpha_2}
  =
  +
  \mathbf{d}\theta^{\alpha_2}
  \wedge
  \mathbf{d} \theta^{\alpha_1}


Just as a smooth set is a generalized smooth space in differential geometry modeled as a sheaf on the category of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them, so a super smooth set is a sheaf on the category of super Cartesian spaces, being a generalized space in supergeometry.
Since super smooth sets contain infinitesimal spaces, it makes good sense to make this explicit and consider super formal smooth sets right away, hence sheaves on super formal Cartesian spaces
For details see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
The concept of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid or super smooth geometric homotopy type is the combination of super ∞-groupoid and smooth ∞-groupoid. The cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth super-∞\infty-groupoids is a context that realizes higher supergeometry.
Super smooth ∞\infty-groupoids include supermanifolds, super Lie groups and their deloopings etc. Under Lie differentiation these map to super L-∞ algebras.
We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at smooth super infinity-groupoid.

Definition
Write


CartSp for the site of Cartesian spaces;


InfPoint≔WAlg opInfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op} for the category of first-order infinitesimally thickened points (i.e. the formal duals of commutative algebras over the real numbers of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R}\oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional square-0 nilpotent ideal).


SuperPoint≔WAlg super opSuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op} for the category of superpoints, by which we here mean the formal duals to commutative superalgebras which are super-Weil algebras.


There are then “semidirect product” sites CartSp⋊InfinPointCartSp \rtimes InfinPoint and CartSp⋊SuperPointCartSp \rtimes SuperPoint (whose objects are Cartesian products of the given form inside synthetic differential supergeometry and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).
Set then
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊InfPoint)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)


for the collection of formal smooth ∞-groupoids (see there) and finally
SuperSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊SuperPoint)
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)


for that of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid

the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at superalgebra – Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras.




Remark
Passing to (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves, this yields, via (∞,1)-Kan extension, a sequence of adjoint quadruples as follows:
      ⟵      ↪  ↪    ⟵  ⟵  ⟵  Δ: ∞Grpd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↪ FormalSmooth∞Grpd ↪ SuperFormalSmooth∞Grpd   ⟵  ⟵    ↪

Proposition
Passing to the adjoint triples of idempotent monads and idempotent comonads which this induces, then yields


on the left the shape modality ∫\int, flat modality ♭\flat and sharp modality ♯\sharp,


in the middle yields the reduction modality ℜ\Re, the infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im and the infinitesimal flat modality &\&.


on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit ⇝\rightsquigarrow is the bosonic modality and whose left piece ⇉\rightrightarrows produces super-even components, containing all the “fermion currents” if one wishes , which in this unity of opposites hence deserves to be called the fermionic modality. The further right adjoint RhRh is the rheonomy modality.


Hence we get a process of adjoint modalities of the form
  id ⊣ id   ∨  ∨  fermionic ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosonic   ⊥  ⊥  bosonic ⇝ ⊣ Rh rheonomic   ∨  ∨  reduced ℜ ⊣ ℑ infinitesimal   ⊥  ⊥  infinitesimal ℑ ⊣ & étale   ∨  ∨  contractible ʃ ⊣ ♭ discrete   ⊥  ⊥  discrete ♭ ⊣ ♯ differential   ∨  ∨   ∅ ⊣ *

    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }


where “∨\vee” denotes inclusion of modal types. The first level is cohesion, the second is differential cohesion (elasticity), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further “square roots” of all infinitesimal generators.


Proof
All the sites are ∞-cohesive sites, which gives that we have an cohesive (infinity,1)-topos. The composite inclusion on the right is an ∞-cohesive neighbourhood site, whence the inclusion Smooth∞Gpd↪SuperFormalSmooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd exhibits differential cohesion.
With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the Aufhebung of ℜ⊣ℑ\Re \dashv \Im by ⇝⊣Rh\rightsquigarrow \dashv Rh and the further opposition ⇉⊣⇝\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow.

A diffeological space is a type of generalized smooth space. As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of smooth manifold but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren’t manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see manifolds of mapping spaces.)
In a little more detail, a diffeology, 𝒟\mathcal{D} on a set XX is a presheaf on the category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms. To each open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, it assigns a subset of Set(U,X)\Set(U,X). The functions in Set(U,X)\Set(U,X) are to be regarded as the “smooth functions” from UU to XX. A diffeological space is then a set together with a diffeology on it.
Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in (Souriau 79). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook (Iglesias-Zemmour 13)

Definition
Let 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} denote the site whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and whose morphisms are smooth maps between these. The Grothendieck topology on 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} is generated by the coverage of open covers, i.e., a family of maps {U i→X} i∈I\{U_i\to X\}_{i\in I} is a covering family if every map U i→XU_i\to X is an open embedding and the union of the images of U iU_i in XX equals XX.
A diffeological space is a pair (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) where


XX is a set


and 𝒟∈Sh(𝒪𝓅)\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op}) is a diffeology on XX:


a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦Hom Set(U,X)U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X) with 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X


equivalently: a concrete sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} such that 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X - a concrete smooth space (see there for more details).




A morphism of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding sheaves: we take DiffeologicalSp↪Sh(CartSp)DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) to be the full subcategory on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

For (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) a diffeological space, and for any U∈𝒪𝓅U \in \mathcal{Op}, the set 𝒟(U)\mathcal{D}(U) is also called the set of plots in XX on UU. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping UU smoothly into the would-be space XX. This assignment defined what it means for a map U→XU \to X of sets to be smooth.
For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized spaces see motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
A sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to CartSp, the full subcategory of Cartesian space: The fully faithful functor CartSp↪𝒪𝓅CartSp \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Op} is a dense subsite-inclusion. Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to CartSp.
One may define a smooth sets to be any sheaf of CartSp. A diffeological space is equivalently a concrete sheaf on the concrete site CartSp. (For details see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.)
The full subcategory
DiffeologicalSpaces↪Sh(CartSp)
  DiffeologicalSpaces \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)


on all concrete sheaves is not a topos, but is a quasitopos.
This is Prop.  below.
The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦X |U|U \mapsto X^{|U|}. In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set XX as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0.
Relation to topological and Δ\Delta-generated spaces


Proposition
(adjunction between topological spaces and diffeological spaces)
There is a pair of adjoint functors
(1)TopSpAA⊥AA⟶Cdfflg⟵DtplgDifflgSp
  
  TopSp
  \underoverset{
    \underset{
      Cdfflg

  DifflgSp


between the categories of TopologicalSpaces and of DiffeologicalSpaces, where


CdfflgCdfflg takes a topological space XX to the continuous diffeology, namely the diffeological space on the same underlying set X sX_s whose plots U s→X sU_s \to X_s are the continuous functions (from the underlying topological space of the domain UU).


DtplgDtplg takes a diffeological space to the diffeological topology (D-topology), namely the topological space with the same underlying set X sX_s and with the final topology that makes all its plots U s→X sU_{s} \to X_{s} into continuous functions: called the D-topology.
Hence a subset O⊂♭XO \subset \flat X is an open subset in the D-topology precisely if for each plot f:U→Xf \colon U \to X the preimage f −1(O)⊂Uf^{-1}(O) \subset U is an open subset in the Cartesian space UU.


Moreover:


the fixed points of this adjunction X∈X \inTopologicalSpaces (those for which the counit is an isomorphism, hence here: a homeomorphism) are precisely the Delta-generated topological spaces (i.e. D-topological spaces):
XisΔ-generated⇔Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶≃ϵ XX
  X \;\,\text{is}\;\Delta\text{-generated}
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \underoverset{\simeq}{\;\;\epsilon_X\;\;}{\longrightarrow}
  X



this is an idempotent adjunction, which exhibits Δ\Delta-generated/D-topological spaces as a reflective subcategory inside diffeological spaces and a coreflective subcategory inside all topological spaces:

  DiffeologicalSpaces


Finally, these adjunctions are a sequence of Quillen equivalences with respect to the:
classical model structure on topological spacesmodel structure on D-topological spacesmodel structure on diffeological spaces


Caution: There was a gap in the original proof that DTopologicalSpaces≃ QuillenDiffeologicalSpacesDTopologicalSpaces \simeq_{Quillen} DiffeologicalSpaces. The gap is claimed to be filled now, see the commented references here.


Essentially these adjunctions and their properties are observed in Shimakawa, Yoshida & Haraguchi 2010, Prop. 3.1, Prop. 3.2, Lem. 3.3, see also Christensen, Sinnamon & Wu 2014, Sec. 3.2. The model structures and Quillen equivalences are due to Haraguchi 13, Thm. 3.3 (on the left) and Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13, Sec. 7 (on the right).

Proof
We spell out the existence of the idempotent adjunction (2):
First, to see we have an adjunction Dtplg⊣CdfflgDtplg \dashv Cdfflg, we check the hom-isomorphism (here).
Let X∈DiffeologicalSpacesX \in DiffeologicalSpaces and Y∈TopologicalSpacesY \in TopologicalSpaces. Write (−) s(-)_s for the underlying sets. Then a morphism, hence a continuous function of the form
f:Dtplg(X)⟶Y,
  f \;\colon\; Dtplg(X) \longrightarrow Y
  \,,


is a function f s:X s→Y sf_s \colon X_s \to Y_s of the underlying sets such that for every open subset A⊂Y sA \subset Y_s and every smooth function of the form ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X the preimage (f s∘ϕ s) −1(A)⊂ℝ n(f_s \circ \phi_s)^{-1}(A) \subset \mathbb{R}^n is open. But this means equivalently that for every such ϕ\phi, f∘ϕf \circ \phi is continuous. This, in turn, means equivalently that the same underlying function f sf_s constitutes a smooth function f˜:X⟶Cdfflg(Y)\widetilde f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Cdfflg(Y).
In summary, we thus have a bijection of hom-sets
Hom(Dtplg(X),Y) ≃ Hom(X,Cdfflg(Y)) f s ↦ (f˜) s=f s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(X), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(X, Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    f_s &\mapsto& (\widetilde f)_s = f_s
  }


given simply as the identity on the underlying functions of underlying sets. This makes it immediate that this hom-isomorphism is natural in XX and YY and this establishes the adjunction.
Next, to see that the D-topological spaces are the fixed points of this adjunction, we apply the above natural bijection on hom-sets to the case
Hom(Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)),Y) ≃ Hom(Cdfflg(Z),Cdfflg(Y)) (ϵ Z) s ↦ (id) s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(Cdfflg(Z), Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    (\epsilon_Z)_s &\mapsto& (\mathrm{id})_s
  }


to find that the counit of the adjunction
Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶ϵ XX
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \overset{\epsilon_X}{\longrightarrow}
  X


is given by the identity function on the underlying sets (ϵ X) s=id (X s)(\epsilon_X)_s = id_{(X_s)}.
Therefore η X\eta_X is an isomorphism, namely a homeomorphism, precisely if the open subsets of X sX_s with respect to the topology on XX are precisely those with respect to the topology on Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))Dtplg(Cdfflg(X)), which means equivalently that the open subsets of XX coincide with those whose pre-images under all continuous functions ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X are open. This means equivalently that XX is a D-topological space.
Finally, to see that we have an idempotent adjunction, it is sufficient to check (by this Prop.) that the comonad
Dtplg∘Cdfflg:TopologicalSpaces→TopologicalSpaces
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \;\colon\; TopologicalSpaces \to TopologicalSpaces


is an idempotent comonad, hence that
Dtplg∘Cdfflg⟶Dtplg⋅η⋅CdfflgDtplg∘Cdfflg∘Dtplg∘Cdfflg
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg
  \overset{
    Dtplg \cdot \eta \cdot Cdfflg
  }{\longrightarrow}
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \circ Dtplg \circ Cdfflg


is a natural isomorphism. But, as before for the adjunction counit ϵ\epsilon, we have that also the adjunction unit η\eta is the identity function on the underlying sets. Therefore, this being a natural isomorphism is equivalent to the operation of passing to the D-topological refinement of the topology of a topological space being an idempotent operation, which is clearly the case.


Further discussion of the D-topology is in CSW 13.
Topological homotopy type and diffeological shape


Definition
(diffeological singular simplicial set)
Consider the simplicial diffeological space
Δ ⟶Δ diff • DiffeologicalSpaces [n] ↦ Δ diff n≔{x→∈ℝ n+1|∑ix i=1}
  \array{
    \Delta 
    &
    \overset{

      \;\vert\;
      \underset{i}{\sum} x^i = 1
    \big\}
    }
  }


which in degree nn is the standard extended n-simplex inside Cartesian space ℝ n+1\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, equipped with its sub-diffeology.
This induces a nerve and realization adjunction between diffeological spaces and simplicial sets:

  SimplicialSets
  \,,


where the right adjoint is the diffeological singular simplicial set functor Sing diffSing_{diff}.

(e.g. Christensen-Wu 13, Def. 4.3)

Remark
(diffeological singular simplicial set as path ∞-groupoid)
Regarding simplicial sets as presenting ∞-groupoids, we may think of Sing diff(X)Sing_{diff}(X) (Def. ) as the path ∞-groupoid of the diffeological space XX.
In fact, by the discussion at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid we have that Sing diffSing_{diff} is equvialent to the shape of diffeological spaces regarded as objects of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids:
Sing diff≃Shp∘i:DiffeologicalSpaces↪iSmoothGroupoids ∞⟶ShapeGroupoids ∞
  Sing_{diff}
  \;\simeq\;
  Shp \circ i
  \;\;\colon\;\;
  DiffeologicalSpaces

  SmoothGroupoids_{\infty}
  \overset{Shape}{\longrightarrow}
   Groupoids_\infty






Proposition
(topological homotopy type is cohesive shape of continuous diffeology)  For every X∈X \in TopologicalSpaces, the cohesive shape/path ∞-groupoid presented by its diffeological singular simplicial set (Def. , Remark ) of its continuous diffeology is naturally\,weak homotopy equivalent to the homotopy type of XX presented by the ordinary singular simplicial set:
Sing diff(Cdfflg(X))⟶∈W whSing(X).
  Sing_{diff}
  \big(
    Cdfflg(X)

  \underoverset
    { \in \mathrm{W}_{wh} }
    {}
    {\longrightarrow}
  Sing(X)
  \,.





(Christensen & Wu 2013, Prop. 4.14)



Proposition
(diffeological internal hom on D-topological spaces has correct cohesive shape)  For X,A∈DTopSp↪TopSpX, A \,\in\, DTopSp \hookrightarrow TopSp a pair of D-topological spaces, their internal hom formed in diffeological spaces has diffeological singular simplicial complex Sing diff(−)Sing_{diff}(-) (3) weakly homotopy equivalent to the ordinary singular simplicial set Sing(−)Sing(-) of the ordinary mapping space Maps TopMaps_{Top} with its compact-open topology:
X,A∈kTopSp⊢Sing diff(Maps dfflg(X,A))⟶∈W whSing(Maps Top(X,A))  
  X,\, A

    {\longrightarrow}
  Sing
  \left(
  Maps_{Top}
  \big(
     X
     ,\,
     A
  \big)
  \right)





Proof
By SYH 10 we have the following morphism:
(4)Cdfflg(Maps Top(X,A))⟶∈Cdfflg(W wh)Cdfflg(ϕ)Cdfflg(smap(X,A))≃Maps dfflg(X,A),
  
  Cdfflg
  \big(
    Maps_{Top}(X,\,A)
  \big)
  \underoverset
    { \in Cdfflg(\mathrm{W}_{wh}) }
    { Cdfflg(\phi) }
    {\longrightarrow}
  Cdfflg
  \big(
    \mathbf{smap}(X ,\, A)
  \big)
  \;\;
  \simeq
  \;\;
  Maps_{dfflg}
  (X,\, A)
  \,,


where smap\mathbf{smap} is some topologization of the set of maps (defined on their p. 6 ) of which all we need to know is that:


(shown on the right of (4)) its image under CdfflgCdfflg is isomorphic to the internal hom Maps dfflgMaps_{dfflg} in diffeological spaces, according to their Prop. 4.7 (p. 7),


(shown on the left of (4)) it is weak homotopy equivalent, via some map ϕ\phi according to their Prop. 5.4 (p. 9) to the compact-open topology.


Hence the claim follows by using 2-out-of-3 in the naturality square of the natural weak homotopy equivalence from Prop.

Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces

Proposition
The obvious functor from the category SmoothManifolds of smooth manifolds to the category DiffeologicalSpaces of diffeological spaces is a full and faithful functor
SmoothManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpacess.
  SmoothManifolds \hookrightarrow  DiffeologicalSpacess
  \,.



Proof
This is a direct consequence of the fact that CartSpsmooth_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothManifolds and the Yoneda lemma.
It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:
To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if f,g:X→Yf,g : X \to Y are two smooth functions that differ at some point, then they must differ in some open neighbourhood of that point. This open ball is a plot, hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that plot.
To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets f:X→Yf : X \to Y that sends plots to plots is necessarily a smooth function, hence that all its derivatives exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves γ:(0,1)→X\gamma : (0,1) \to X in XX. By Boman's theorem, a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular plots, so a function that takes all plots of XX to plots of YY must be smooth.


Remark
The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site CartSp dim≤1⊂CartSpCartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp on the objects ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0 and ℝ 1\mathbb{R}^1 and still have a full and faithful embedding
Diff↪Sh(CartSp dim≤1).
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.


This fact plays a role in the definition of Frölicher spaces, which are generalized smooth spaces defined by plots by curves into and out of them.
While the site CartSp dim≤1CartSp_{dim \leq 1} is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp dim≤1)Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1}) lacks some non-concrete sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree ≥2\geq 2.

Embedding of smooth manifolds with boundary into diffeological spaces

Proposition
(manifolds with boundaries and corners form full subcategory of diffeological spaces)
The evident functor
SmthMfdWBdrCrn↪AAAADiffeologicalSpaces
  SmthMfdWBdrCrn \overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\hookrightarrow} DiffeologicalSpaces


from the category of smooth manifolds with boundaries and corners to that of diffeological spaces is fully faithful, hence is a full subcategory-embedding.

(Iglesias-Zemmour 13, 4.16, Gürer & Iglesias-Zemmour 19)
Embedding of Banach manifolds into diffeological spaces
Also Banach manifolds embed fully faithfully into the category of diffeological spaces. In (Hain) this is discussed in terms of Chen smooth spaces.
Embedding of Fréchet manifolds into diffeological spaces
We discuss a natural embedding of Fréchet manifolds into the category of diffeological spaces.

Definition
Define a functor
ι:FrechetManifolds→DiffeologicalSpaces
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces


in the evident way by taking for XX a Fréchet manifold for any U∈U \in  CartSp the set of UU-plots of ι(X)\iota(X) to be the set of smooth functions U→XU \to X.


Proposition
The functor ι:FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.

This appears as (Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1, following Losik 92), as variant of the analogous statement for Banach manifolds in (Hain). The fact that maps between Fréchet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in (Frölicher 81, théorème 1)
The statement is also implied by (Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14) which states that functions between locally convex vector spaces are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth curves to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses Michal-Bastiani smoothness (Glöckner 06), in which case one merely has a faithful functor lctvs→DiffeologicalSpaceslctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces. Notice that the choice of topology in (Kriegl-Michor 97) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fréchet manifolds.

Proposition
Let X,Y∈SmoothManifoldX, Y \in SmoothManifold with XX a compact manifold.
Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}:
ι(C ∞(X,Y) Fr)≃C ∞(X,Y) diff.
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.


This appears as (Waldorf 09, lemma A.1.7).
\,
Embedding of diffeological spaces into smooth sets
We discuss how diffeological spaces are equivalently the concrete objects in the cohesive topos of smooth sets (see there).

Proposition
(diffeological spaces are the concrete smooth sets)
The full subcategory on the concrete objects in the topos SmoothSet≔Sh(Cart)SmoothSet \coloneqq Sh(Cart) of smooth sets is equivalent to the category of diffeological spaces


Proof
The concrete sheaves for the local topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are by definition those objects XX for which the (Γ⊣CoDisc)(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)-unit
X→CoDiscΓX
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X


is a monomorphism. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every U∈CartSpU \in CartSp we have that
X(U)≃Hom Sh(U,X)→Hom Sh(U,CodiscΓX)≃Hom Set(ΓU,ΓX)
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)


is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

For a fully detailed proof see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is a quasitopos.


Proof
This follows from the discussion at Locality.

This has some immediate general abstract consequences

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is


a cartesian closed category


a closed monoidal category.



Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the concrete objects is the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)≃Sh(SmthMfd)Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd) of smooth sets. This is a general context for differential geometry. From there one can pass further to higher differential geometry: the topos of smooth sets in turn embeds
Sh(CartSp)↪Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp)
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 


into the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of “higher smooth sets” –smooth ∞-groupoids – as precisely the 0-truncated objects.
Distribution theory
Since a space of smooth functions on a smooth manifold is canonically a diffeological space, it is natural to consider the smooth linear functionals on such mapping spaces. These turn out to be equivalent to the continuous linear functionals, hence to distributional densities. See at distributions are the smooth linear functionals for details.
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \;\colon\; \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc \,\colon\, \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \;\colon\; \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
In this situation, we say that a concrete object X∈ℰX \in \mathcal{E} is one for which the (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc)-unit of an adjunction is a monomorphism.
If ℰ\mathcal{E} is a sheaf topos, this is called a concrete sheaf.
If ℰ\mathcal{E} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then this is called a concrete (∞,1)-sheaf or the like.
The dual notion is that of a co-concrete object.
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.
Concretification factorization

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a local topos, write
H conc↪AAAAH
  \mathbf{H}_{conc} 
  \overset{ \phantom{AAAA} }{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}


for its full subcategory of concrete objects.
Then there is a sequence of reflective subcategory-inclusions that factor the (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc)-adjunction as
Γ⊣coDisc:H⟶AAconcAA ↩AAι concAAH conc⟶AAA ↩AAASet
  \Gamma \;\dashv\; coDisc
  \;\;\colon\;\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \array{
    \overset{\phantom{AA} conc \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}
    \\
    \overset{\phantom{AA} \iota_{conc} \phantom{AA}}{\hookleftarrow}
  }
  \mathbf{H}_{conc}
  \array{
    \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\longrightarrow}
    \\
    \overset{\phantom{AAA}}{\hookleftarrow}
  }
  Set


Here morphisms on top are left adjoint to morphisms below, hence
conc⊣ι conc
  conc \dashv \iota_{conc}


exhibits the concrete objects as a reflective subcategory, the reflector concconc being “concretification”.


Proof
For the adjunction on the right, we just need to observe that for every set S∈SetS \in Set, the codiscrete object coDisc(S)coDisc(S) is concrete, which is immediate by idempotency of ♯\sharp and the fact that every isomorphism is also a monomorphism.
For the adjunction on the left we claim that the left adjoint concconc (concretification), is given by sending each object to the image of its (Γ⊣coDisc)(\Gamma \dashv coDisc) adjunction unit η ♯\eta^\sharp:
conc:X↦im(η X ♯)
  conc \;\colon\; X \mapsto im(\eta^\sharp_X)


hence to the object which exhibits the epi/mono-factorization of η X ♯\eta^\sharp_X
(1)η X ♯:X⟶epiη X concconcX⟶mono♯X.
  
  \eta^\sharp_X
  \;\colon\;
  X 
    \underoverset{epi}{ \eta^{conc}_X }{\longrightarrow}
  conc X
    \underoverset{mono}{}{\longrightarrow}
  \sharp X
  \,.


First we need to show that concXconc X, thus defined, is indeed concrete, hence that η im(η X ♯) ♯\eta^\sharp_{im(\eta^\sharp_X)} is a monomorphism. For this, consider the following naturality square of the Γ⊣coDisc\Gamma \dashv coDisc-adjunction hom-isomorphism
(2)A Hom Set(Γim(η X ♯),Γim(η X ♯)) ≃ Hom H(im(η X ♯),♯im(η X ♯))  (−)∘Γ(η X conc)↓  ↓ (−)∘η X conc Hom Set(ΓX,Γim(η X ♯)) ≃ Hom H(X,♯im(η X ♯))AAAAA {id Γim(η X ♯)} ⟶ ♯(η X conc)∘η X ♯{η im(η X ♯) ♯} ↓  ♯(η X conc)∘η X ♯↓ {Γ(η X conc)} ⟶ {♯(η X conc)⏟iso∘η X ♯=η im(η X ♯) ♯∘η X conc}

By chasing the identity morphism on Γim(η X ♯)\Gamma im(\eta^\sharp_X) through this diagram, as shown by the diagram on the right, we obtain the equality displayed in the bottom right entry, where we used the general formula for adjuncts and the definition ♯≔coDisc∘Γ\sharp \coloneqq coDisc \circ \Gamma.
But observe that Γ(η X conc)\Gamma (\eta^{conc}_X), and hence also ♯(η X conc)\sharp(\eta^{conc}_X), is an isomorphism, as indicated above: Since Γ\Gamma is both a left adjoint as well as a right adjoint, it preserves both epimorphisms as well as monomorphisms, hence it preserves image factorizations. This implies that Γη X conc\Gamma \eta^{conc}_X is the epimorphism onto the image of Γ(η X ♯)\Gamma( \eta^\sharp_X ). But by idempotency of ♯\sharp, the latter is an isomorphism, and hence so is the epimorphism in its image factorization.
Therefore the equality in (2) says that
η X ♯ =(iso∘η im(η X ♯) ♯)∘η X conc  =mono∘η X conc,
  \begin{aligned}
    \eta^\sharp_{ X } 
      & =
    \left( 
      iso \circ \eta^{\sharp}_{ im(\eta^\sharp_X)} 
    \right)
      \circ 
    \eta^{conc}_X
    \\
    & =
    mono \circ \eta^{conc}_X 
    \,,
  \end{aligned}


where in the second line we remembered that η X conc\eta^{conc}_X is, by definition, the epimorphism in the epi/mono-factorization of η X ♯\eta^\sharp_X.
Now the defining property of epimorphisms allows to cancel this commmon factor on both sides, which yields
η im(η X ♯) ♯=iso∘mono=mono.
  \eta^{\sharp}_{ im(\eta^\sharp_X) }
  \;=\;
  iso \circ mono
  \;=\;
  mono.


This shows that concX≔im(η X ♯)conc X \coloneqq im(\eta^\sharp_X) is indeed concrete.
It remains to show that this construction is left adjoint to the inclusion. We claim that the adjunction unit of (conc⊣ι conc)(conc \dashv \iota_{conc}) is provided by η conc\eta^{conc} (1).
To see this, first notice that, since the epi/mono-factorization is orthogonal and hence functorial, we have commuting diagrams of the form
(3)X 1 ⟶epiη X 1 conc im(η X 1 ♯) ⟶mono ♯X 1 ↓  ↓  ↓ X 2 ⟶epiη X 2 conc im(η X 2 ♯) ⟶mono ♯X 2
  
  \array{
    X_1 
      &\underoverset{epi}{\eta^{conc}_{X_1}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_1})
      &\underset{mono}{\longrightarrow}&
    \sharp X_1
    \\
    \big\downarrow && \big\downarrow && \big\downarrow
    \\
    X_2 
      &\underoverset{epi}{\eta^{conc}_{X_2}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_2})
      &\underset{mono}{\longrightarrow}&
    \sharp X_2
  }


Now to demonstrate the adjunction, it is sufficient, to show that η conc\eta^{conc} is a universal morphism in the sense discussed at adjoint functors. Hence consider any morphism f:X 1→X 2f \;\colon\; X_1 \to X_2 with X 2∈H conc↪HX_2 \in \mathbf{H}_{conc} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}. Then we need to show that there is a unique diagonal morphism as below, that makes the following top left triangle commute:
X 1 ⟶AAfAA X 2  epi↓ η X 1 conc  ∃!↗ ↓ mono im(η X 1 ♯) ⟶ ♯X 2
  \array{
    X_1 
      &\overset{\phantom{AA} f \phantom{AA}}{\longrightarrow}& 
    X_2
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{epi}}\big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta^{conc}_{X_1}}} 
      &{}^{\mathllap{\exists !}}\nearrow& 
    \big\downarrow^{\mathrlap{mono}}
    \\
    im(\eta^\sharp_{X_1}) 
      &\underset{}{\longrightarrow}& 
    \sharp X_2
  }


Now, from (3), we have a commuting square as shown. Here the left morphism is an epimorphism by construction, while the right morphism is a monomorphism by assumption on X 2X_2. With this, the epi/mono-factorization says that there is a diagonal lift which makes both triangles commute.
It remains to see that the lift is unique with just the property of making the top left triangle commute. But this is equivalently the statement that the left morphism is an epimorphism.

On super smooth infinity-groupoids there is a modal operator (−)⇝\stackrel{\rightsquigarrow}{(-)} which projects onto the bosonic components of the supergeometry. On formal dual superalgebras this is given by passing to the body. In terms of physical fields this is the projection onto boson fields, which are hence the modal types of ⇝\rightsquigarrow, and so it makes sense to speak of the bosonic modality.
This has a left adjoint ⇉\rightrightarrows (which on superalgebras passes to the even-graded sub-algebra) and hence together these form an adjoint modality which may be thought of as characterizing the supergeometry. See at super smooth infinity-groupoid – Cohesion. With ⇉\rightrightarrows being opposite to ⇝\rightsquigarrow thereby, it makes sense to call it the fermionic modality.
Notice that the fermionic currents in physics (e.g. the electron density current) are indeed fermionic bilinears, i.e. are indeed in the even subalgebras of the underlying superalgebra.
fermions ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosons
  \array{
    fermions & \rightrightarrows &\stackrel{}{\dashv}& \rightsquigarrow & bosons
  }


The modal objects for ⇝\rightsquigarrow are the bosonic objects.
The right adjoint of the bosonic modality is the rheonomy modality.
The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)

In homotopy type theory an h-set is a type XX – hence a homotopy type – with the special property that any two of its terms x,y:Xx,y : X are equal (equivalent) in an at most essentially unique way, hence that the identity type (x=y):Type(x = y) : Type is an h-proposition.
The notion of h-set is an internalization of the notion of 0-truncated object into homotopy type theory, essentially an internalization of the notion of set (or possibly of preset). See below in Relation to internal sets for more on this.
h-Sets can also be regarded as a way of embedding extensional type theory into intensional type theory.
Let AA be a type in dependent type theory with dependent sums, dependent products, and identity types. We define a new type isSet(A)isSet(A) as follows:
isSet(A)≔∏ x:A∏ y:AisProp(Id A(x,y))isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x\colon A} \prod_{y\colon A} isProp(\mathrm{Id}_{A}(x, y))
(using any equivalent definition of the predicate isProp for h-propositions; and where “∏\prod” denotes dependent product types and “Id A\mathrm{Id}_A” denotes identity types on AA).
In other words, the only relationship between two elements of an h-set is whether they are equal; there is no room for more than one path between them. By beta-reducing this definition, we can express it as
isSet(A)≔∏ x,y:A∏ p,q:Id A(x,y)Id Id A(x,y)(p,q)isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x,y\colon A} \prod_{p,q\colon \mathrm{Id}_A(x, y)} \mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{Id}_A(x, y)}(p, q)
In other words, any two parallel paths in AA are equal.
A provably equivalent definition is
isSet(A)≔∏ x:A∏ p:Id A(x,x)Id Id A(x,x)(p,refl A(x))isSet(A) \coloneqq \prod_{x\colon A} \prod_{p\colon \mathrm{Id}_A(x, x)} \mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{Id}_A(x, x)}(p, \mathrm{refl}_A(x))
This says that a version of Streicher’s “axiom K” holds for h-sets. (See also at axiom UIP.)
Another definition of a h-set is an S 1S^1-local type, a type for which the canonical function const A,S 1:A→(S 1→A)\mathrm{const}_{A, S^1}:A \to (S^1 \to A), which takes elements of AA to constant functions S 1→AS^1 \to A from the circle type S 1S^1 to AA, is an equivalence of types:
isSet(A)≔∏ f:S 1→A∑ y:∑ x:AId S 1→A(const A,S 1(x),f)∏ z:∑ x:AId S 1→A(const A,S 1(x),f)Id ∑ x:AId S 1→A(const A,S 1(x),f)(y,z)\mathrm{isSet}(A) \coloneqq \prod_{f:S^1 \to A} \sum_{y:\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{Id}_{S^1 \to A}(\mathrm{const}_{A, S^1}(x), f)} \prod_{z:\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{Id}_{S^1 \to A}(\mathrm{const}_{A, S^1}(x), f)} \mathrm{Id}_{\sum_{x:A} \mathrm{Id}_{S^1 \to A}(\mathrm{const}_{A, S^1}(x), f)}(y, z)
Equivalent characterizations
There are some equivalent characterizations of a type AA being an h-set:


A type AA is an h-set if and only if all its identity types x= Ayx=_A y have split support, i.e. ∏ (x,y:A)‖x=y‖→(x=y)\prod_{(x,y:A)} \Vert x=y\Vert \to (x=y). This is proven in (KECA).


More generally, AA is an h-set if and only if there is some R:A→A→PropR:A\to A\to Prop which is reflexive (i.e. ∏ (x:A)R(x,x)\prod_{(x:A)} R(x,x)) and such that ∏ (x,y:A)R(x,y)→(x=y)\prod_{(x,y:A)} R(x,y) \to (x=y). This is Theorem 7.2.2 in the HoTT Book.


Hedberg’s theorem
Hedberg's theorem states that


Theorem
Suppose that AA is a type with untruncated decidable equality, a type such that for every element a:Aa:A and b:Ab:A, there is an element in the sum type of the identity type a= Aba =_A b and the type of functions from a= Aba =_A b to the empty type.
a:A,b:A⊢δ(a,b):(a= Ab)+(a= Ab)→∅a:A, b:A \vdash \delta(a, b):(a =_A b) + (a =_A b) \to \emptyset
Then AA is a h-set.


A proof of this theorem could be found in Hedberg's theorem.
Relation to internal sets
When using homotopy type theory as the ambient foundations, h-sets generally play the role of the sets. When homotopy type theory is the internal logic of some (∞,1)-category, then the h-sets are the “internal sets” in this internal logic. (Not to be confused with the other meaning of internal set.)
Note, though, that this notion of “internal set” is of a different sort from the usual notions of internal category or internal groupoid. If an internal set is an h-set, then an “internal groupoid” should mean a 1-truncated type, whereas an internal groupoid usually means some kind of groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category. Conversely, the usual meaning of “internal groupoid” suggests that the meaning of “internal set” should be something more like a setoid, with the h-sets being more like presets. This latter meaning is how “sets” are more often defined by constructive type theorists.
The point is that to be worthy of the name “set”, a notion ought to come with “quotients of equivalence relations”. If we start with a notion which does not have quotients, such as the types in ordinary Martin-Löf dependent type theory, then in order to get a good notion of “set” we need to “freely add quotients”, which semantically means passing to the exact completion whose objects are setoids. But if we start with a notion that does have quotients, then this is unnecessary. In homotopy type theory, h-sets do have quotients, which can be constructed using higher inductive types; thus it makes sense to call them “sets” rather than “presets”.
A good way to reconcile these seemingly clashing terminologies is to talk about exact completions of unary sites or (∞,1)-sites. The presence of a Grothendieck topology allows us to “remember” to what extent our given notion has well-behaved quotients: if we have no quotients, then we use the trivial topology, whereas if we have quotients, we can use the regular topology. And the exact completion builds in quotients “freely” but preserving those which the topology asserts to already exist. In particular, if we start with quotients (an exact category or (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category), then the exact completion of the regular topology is idempotent, whereas if we start with a trivial topology, then the exact completion gives a category of setoids. Thus, in general, the good notion of “internal set” in a unary site is “object of the exact completion”.
Pretopos of hsets
The h-sets in HoTT form a ΠW-pretopos (Rijke-Spitters 13). See also at structural set theory.
A differentiable manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space (a topological manifold) and such that the gluing functions which relate these Euclidean local charts to each other are differentiable functions, for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity, then one speaks of smooth manifolds. For a general discussion see at manifold.
Differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for much of differential geometry. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry.
If one relaxes the condition from being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the concept of diffeological spaces or even smooth sets, see at generalized smooth space for more on this.
The generalization of differentiable manifolds to higher differential geometry are orbifolds and more generally differentiable stacks. If one combines this with the generalization to smooth sets then one obtains the concept of smooth stacks and eventually smooth infinity-stacks.
Smooth manifolds form a category, SmoothManifolds.
Traditional definition
For the traditional definition see at differentiable manifold.
Patching as idempotent splitting
In an exercise of his 1973 Perugia lectures F. William Lawvere reported a somewhat surprising observation:
In the case of smooth manifolds the process of piecing together the local data can be elegantly summed up as splitting of idempotents in a category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces. More precisely:
Let DiffDiff be the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, where by a “smooth manifold”, we mean a finite-dimensional, second-countable, Hausdorff, C ∞C^\infty manifold without boundary. Let i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff be the full subcategory whose objects are the open subspaces of finite-dimensional Cartesian spaces.

Theorem
The subcategory i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff exhibits DiffDiff as an idempotent-splitting completion of OpenOpen.


Proof
By a general lemma for idempotent splittings, it suffices to prove that


Every smooth manifold is a smooth retract of an open set in Euclidean space;


If p:U→Up : U \to U is a smooth idempotent on an open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, then the subset Fix(p)↪UFix(p) \hookrightarrow U is an embedded submanifold.


For the first statement, we use the fact that any manifold MM can be realized as a closed submanifold of some ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, and every closed submanifold has a tubular neighborhood U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n. In this case UU carries a structure of vector bundle over MM in such a way that the inclusion M↪UM \hookrightarrow U is identified with the zero section, so that the bundle projection U→MU \to M provides a retraction, with right inverse given by the zero section.
For the second statement, assume that the origin 00 is a fixed point of pp, and let T 0(U)≅ℝ nT_0(U) \cong \mathbb{R}^n be its tangent space (observe the presence of a canonical isomorphism to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n). Thus we have idempotent linear maps dp(0),Id−dp(0):T 0(U)→T 0(U)d p(0), Id-d p(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(U) where the latter factors through the inclusion kerdp(0)↪T 0(U)\ker \; d p(0) \hookrightarrow T_0(U) via a projection map π:T 0(U)→kerdp(0)\pi: T_0(U) \to \ker \; d p(0). We have a map f:U→ℝ nf: U \to \mathbb{R}^n that takes x∈Ux \in U to x−p(x)x - p(x); let gg denote the composite
U⟶fℝ n≅T 0(U)⟶πkerdp(0).U \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n \cong T_0(U) \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \ker\; d p(0).
Now we make some easy observations:


Fix(p)⊆g −1(0)Fix(p) \subseteq g^{-1}(0).


The map p:U→Up: U \to U restricts to a map p:g −1(0)→g −1(0)p: g^{-1}(0) \to g^{-1}(0), by idempotence of pp.


The derivative dg(0):T 0(U)→T 0(kerdp(0))≅kerdp(0)d g(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(\ker \; d p(0)) \cong \ker \; d p(0) is π\pi again since Id−dp(0)Id - d p(0) is idempotent. Thus dg(0)d g(0) has full rank (mm say), and so the restriction of gg to some neighborhood VV has 00 as a regular value, and g −1(0)∩Vg^{-1}(0) \cap V is a manifold of dimension mm by the implicit function theorem. The tangent space T 0(g −1(0)∩V)T_0(g^{-1}(0) \cap V) is canonically identified with im(dp(0))im(d p(0)).


There are smaller neighborhoods V″⊆V′⊆VV'' \subseteq V' \subseteq V so that pp restricts to maps p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 as in the following diagram (i,i′,i″i, i', i'' are inclusion maps, all taking a domain element xx to itself):
g −1(0)∩V″ ↪i″ g −1(0) p 2↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V′ ↪i′ g −1(0) p 1↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V ↪i g −1(0)\array{
g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' & \stackrel{i''}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_2} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V' & \stackrel{i'}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_1} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0)
}

and such that p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 are diffeomorphisms by the inverse function theorem (noting here that dp i(0):im(dp(0))→im(dp(0))d p_i(0): im(d p(0)) \to im(d p(0)) is the identity map, by idempotence of pp).


Letting q:g −1(0)∩V′→g −1(0)∩V″q: g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \to g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' denote the smooth inverse to p 2p_2, we calculate i′=p∘i″∘qi' = p \circ i'' \circ q, and
ip 1=pi′=ppi″q=pi″q=i′,i p_1 = p i' = p p i''q = p i'' q = i',
so that p 1(x)=xp_1(x) = x for every x∈g −1(0)∩V′x \in g^{-1}(0) \cap V'. Hence g −1(0)∩V′⊆Fix(p)g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \subseteq Fix(p).


From all this it follows that Fix(p)∩V′=g −1(0)∩V′Fix(p) \cap V' = g^{-1}(0) \cap V', meaning Fix(p)Fix(p) is locally diffeomorphic to ℝ m\mathbb{R}^m, and so Fix(p)Fix(p) is an embedded submanifold of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.


Remark
Another proof of this result may be found here.

Lawvere comments on this fact as follows:

 “This powerful theorem justifies bypassing the complicated considerations of charts, coordinate transformations, and atlases commonly offered as a ”basic“ definition of the concept of manifold. For example the 2-sphere, a manifold but not an open set of any Euclidean space, may be fully specified with its smooth structure by considering any open set AA in 3-space EE which contains it but not its center (taken to be 00) and the smooth idempotent endomap of AA given by e(x)=x/|x|e(x) = x/{|x|}. All general constructions (i.e., functors into categories which are Cauchy complete) on manifolds now follow easily (without any need to check whether they are compatible with coverings, etc.) provided they are known on the opens of Euclidean spaces: for example, the tangent bundle on the sphere is obtained by splitting the idempotent e′e' on the tangent bundle A×VA \times V of AA (VV being the vector space of translations of EE) which is obtained by differentiating ee. The same for cohomology groups, etc.” (Lawvere 1989, p.267)

General abstract geometric definition
There is a fundamental and general abstract way to think of smooth manifolds, which realizes their theory as a special case of general constructions in higher geometry.
In this context one specifies for instance 𝒢\mathcal{G} a geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) and then plenty of geometric notions are defined canonically in terms of 𝒢\mathcal{G}. The theory of smooth manifolds appears if one takes 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp.
Alternatively one can specify differential cohesion and proceed as discussed at differential cohesion – structures - Cohesive manifolds (separated).
This is discussed in The geometry CartSp below.
The geometry CartSpCartSp
Let CartSp be the category of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them. This has finite products and is in fact (the syntactic category) of a Lawvere theory: the theory of smooth algebras.
Moreover, CartSpCartSp is naturally equipped with the good open cover coverage that makes it a site.
Both properties together make it a pregeometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) (if the notion of Grothendieck topology is relaxed to that of coverage in StrSp).
For 𝒳\mathcal{X} a topos, a product-preserving functor
𝒪:𝒢→𝒳
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}


is a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. This makes 𝒳\mathcal{X} is 𝒢\mathcal{G}-ringed topos. For 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp this algebra is a smooth algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. If 𝒳\mathcal{X} has a site of definition XX, then this is a sheaf of smooth algebras on XX.
If 𝒪\mathcal{O} sends covering families {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} in 𝒢\mathcal{G} to effective epimorphism ∐ i𝒪(U i)→𝒪(U)\coprod_i \mathcal{O}(U_i) \to \mathcal{O}(U) we say that it is a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}, making 𝒳\mathcal{X} a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally ringed topos.
The big topos Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) itself is canonically equipped with such a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra, given by the Yoneda embedding jj followed by sheafification LL
𝒪:𝒢→jPSh(𝒢)→LSh(𝒢).
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(\mathcal{G}) \stackrel{L}{\to}
  Sh(\mathcal{G})
  \,.


It is important in the context of locally representable locally ringed toposes that we regard Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) as equipped with this local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra. This is what remembers the site and gives a notion of local representability in the first place.
The big topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is a cohesive topos of generalized smooth spaces. Its concrete sheaves are precisely the diffeological spaces. See there for more details. We now discuss how with Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) regarded as a CartSpCartSp-structured topos, smooth manifolds are precisely its locally representable objects.
Cartesian spaces as representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)
The representables themselves should evidently be locally representable and canonically have the structure of CartSpCartSp-structured toposes.
Indeed, every object U∈CartSpU \in \mathrm{CartSp} is canonically a CartSp-ringed space, meaning a topological space equipped with a local sheaf of smooth algebras. More generally: every object U∈CartSpU \in CartSp is canonically incarnated as the CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos

Smooth manifolds as locally representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)

Definition
Say a concrete object XX in the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) – a diffeological space – is locally representable if there exists a family of open embeddings {U i↪X} i∈X\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}_{i \in X} with U i∈CartSp↪jSh(CartSp)U_i \in CartSp \stackrel{j}{\hookrightarrow} Sh(CartSp) such that the canonical morphism out of the coproduct
∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_i U_i \to X


is an effective epimorphism in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp).
Let LocRep(CartSp)↪Sh(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) be the full subcategory on locally representable sheaves.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of categories
Diff≃LocRep(CartSp)
  Diff \simeq LocRep(CartSp)


of the category Diff of smooth manifolds with that of locally representable sheaves for the pre-geometry CartSpCartSp.


Proof
Define a functor Diff→LocRep(CartSp)Diff \to LocRep(CartSp) by sending each smooth manifold to the sheaf over CartSpCartSp that it naturally represents. By definition of manifold there is an open cover {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}. We claim that ∐ iU i→X\coprod_i U_i \to X is an effective epimorphism, so that this functor indeed lands in LocRep(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp). (This is a standard argument of sheaf theory in Diff, we really only need to observe that it goes through over CartSp, too.)
For that we need to show that
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to X


is a coequalizer diagram in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) (that the Cech groupoid of the cover is equivalent to XX.). Notice that the fiber product here is just the intersection in XX U i× XU j≃U i∩U jU_i \times_X U_j \simeq U_i \cap U_j. By the fact that the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is by definition a reflective subcategory of the presheaf topos PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) we have that colimits in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are computed as the sheafification of the corresponding colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). The colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) in turn is computed objectwise. Using this, we see that that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→S({U i})
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to S(\{U_i\})


in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp), where S({U i})S(\{U_i\}) is the sieve corresponding to the cover: the subfunctor S({U i})↪XS(\{U_i\}) \hookrightarrow X of the functor X:CartSp op→SetX : CartSp^{op} \to Set  which assigns to V∈CartSpV \in CartSp the set of smooth functions V→XV \to X that have the property that they factor through any one of the U iU_i.
Essentially by the definition of the coverage on CartSpCartSp, it follows that sheafification takes this subfunctor inclusion to an isomorphism. This shows that XX is indeed the tip of the coequalizer in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) as above, and hence that it is a locally representable sheaf.
Conversely, suppose that for X∈Conc(Sh(CartSp))↪Sh(CartSp)X \in Conc(Sh(CartSp)) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) there is a family of open embeddings {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\} such that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_{i} U_i \to X


in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp), which is the sheafification of the corresponding coequalizer in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). By evaluating this on the point, we find that the underlying set of XX is the coequalizer of the underlying set of the U iU_i in SetSet. Since every plot of XX factors locally through one of the U iU_i it follows that XX is a diffeological space.
It follows that in the pullback diagrams
U i× XU j → U j ↓  ↓ U i → X
  \array{
    U_i \times_X U_j &\to& U_j
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   U_i &\to& X 
  }


the object U i∩U jU_i \cap U_j is the diffeological space whose underlying topological space is the intersection of U iU_i and U jU_j in the topological space underlying XX. In particular the inclusions U i× XU j↪U iU_i \times_X U_j \hookrightarrow U_i are open embeddings.

As locally representable CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
We may switch from regarding smooth manifolds as objects in the big topos X∈Sh(CartSp)X \in Sh(CartSp) to regrading them as toposes themselves, by passing to the over-topos Sh(CartSp)/XSh(CartSp)/X. This remembers the extra (smooth) structure on the topological space XX by being canonically a locally ringed topos with the structure sheaf of smooth functions on XX: a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-toposes
For every choice of geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) there is a notion of 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally representable structured (∞,1)-topos (StrSp).

Claim
Smooth manifolds are equivalently the 0-localic CartSp-generalized schemes of locally finite presentation.


Sketch of proof
The statement says that a smooth manifold XX may be identified with an ∞-stack on CartSp (an ∞-Lie groupoid) which is represented by a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos (𝒳,𝒪 𝒳)(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}) such that


𝒳\mathcal{X} is a 0-localic (∞,1)-topos;


There exists a family of objects {U i∈𝒳}\{U_i \in \mathcal{X}\} such that the canonical morphism ∐ iU i→* 𝒳\coprod_i U_i \to *_{\mathcal{X}} to the terminal object in 𝒳\mathcal{X} is a regular epimorphism;


For every i∈Ii \in I there is an equivalence


(𝒳/U i,𝒪 𝒳|U i)→≃t i(Sh (∞,1)(ℝ n),𝒪(ℝ n)).
    (\mathcal{X}/U_i, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}|U_i})
    \underoverset{\simeq}{t_i}{\to} (Sh_{(\infty,1)}(\mathbb{R}^n), \mathcal{O}(\mathbb{R}^n))
     \,.
  

The second and third condition say in words that (𝒳,𝒪 𝒳)(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}) is locally equivalent to the ordinary cannonically CartSp-locally ringed space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n (for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} the dimension. The first condition then says that these local identifications cover 𝒳\mathcal{X}.

derivations of smooth functions are vector fields


A diffeological space is a type of generalized smooth space. As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of smooth manifold but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren’t manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see manifolds of mapping spaces.)
In a little more detail, a diffeology, 𝒟\mathcal{D} on a set XX is a presheaf on the category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms. To each open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, it assigns a subset of Set(U,X)\Set(U,X). The functions in Set(U,X)\Set(U,X) are to be regarded as the “smooth functions” from UU to XX. A diffeological space is then a set together with a diffeology on it.
Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in (Souriau 79). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook (Iglesias-Zemmour 13)

Definition
Let 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} denote the site whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and whose morphisms are smooth maps between these. The Grothendieck topology on 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} is generated by the coverage of open covers, i.e., a family of maps {U i→X} i∈I\{U_i\to X\}_{i\in I} is a covering family if every map U i→XU_i\to X is an open embedding and the union of the images of U iU_i in XX equals XX.
A diffeological space is a pair (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) where


XX is a set


and 𝒟∈Sh(𝒪𝓅)\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op}) is a diffeology on XX:


a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦Hom Set(U,X)U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X) with 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X


equivalently: a concrete sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} such that 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X - a concrete smooth space (see there for more details).




A morphism of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding sheaves: we take DiffeologicalSp↪Sh(CartSp)DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) to be the full subcategory on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

For (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) a diffeological space, and for any U∈𝒪𝓅U \in \mathcal{Op}, the set 𝒟(U)\mathcal{D}(U) is also called the set of plots in XX on UU. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping UU smoothly into the would-be space XX. This assignment defined what it means for a map U→XU \to X of sets to be smooth.
For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized spaces see motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
A sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to CartSp, the full subcategory of Cartesian space: The fully faithful functor CartSp↪𝒪𝓅CartSp \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Op} is a dense subsite-inclusion. Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to CartSp.
One may define a smooth sets to be any sheaf of CartSp. A diffeological space is equivalently a concrete sheaf on the concrete site CartSp. (For details see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.)
The full subcategory
DiffeologicalSpaces↪Sh(CartSp)
  DiffeologicalSpaces \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)


on all concrete sheaves is not a topos, but is a quasitopos.
This is Prop.  below.
The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦X |U|U \mapsto X^{|U|}. In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set XX as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0.
Relation to topological and Δ\Delta-generated spaces


Proposition
(adjunction between topological spaces and diffeological spaces)
There is a pair of adjoint functors

  \underoverset{
    \underset{

between the categories of TopologicalSpaces and of DiffeologicalSpaces, where


CdfflgCdfflg takes a topological space XX to the continuous diffeology, namely the diffeological space on the same underlying set X sX_s whose plots U s→X sU_s \to X_s are the continuous functions (from the underlying topological space of the domain UU).


DtplgDtplg takes a diffeological space to the diffeological topology (D-topology), namely the topological space with the same underlying set X sX_s and with the final topology that makes all its plots U s→X sU_{s} \to X_{s} into continuous functions: called the D-topology.
Hence a subset O⊂♭XO \subset \flat X is an open subset in the D-topology precisely if for each plot f:U→Xf \colon U \to X the preimage f −1(O)⊂Uf^{-1}(O) \subset U is an open subset in the Cartesian space UU.


Moreover:


the fixed points of this adjunction X∈X \inTopologicalSpaces (those for which the counit is an isomorphism, hence here: a homeomorphism) are precisely the Delta-generated topological spaces (i.e. D-topological spaces):
XisΔ-generated⇔Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶≃ϵ XX

  \;\;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \underoverset{\simeq}{\;\;\epsilon_X\;\;}{\longrightarrow}

this is an idempotent adjunction, which exhibits Δ\Delta-generated/D-topological spaces as a reflective subcategory inside diffeological spaces and a coreflective subcategory inside all topological spaces:

Finally, these adjunctions are a sequence of Quillen equivalences with respect to the:
classical model structure on topological spacesmodel structure on D-topological spacesmodel structure on diffeological spaces


Caution: There was a gap in the original proof that DTopologicalSpaces≃ QuillenDiffeologicalSpacesDTopologicalSpaces \simeq_{Quillen} DiffeologicalSpaces. The gap is claimed to be filled now, see the commented references here.


Essentially these adjunctions and their properties are observed in Shimakawa, Yoshida & Haraguchi 2010, Prop. 3.1, Prop. 3.2, Lem. 3.3, see also Christensen, Sinnamon & Wu 2014, Sec. 3.2. The model structures and Quillen equivalences are due to Haraguchi 13, Thm. 3.3 (on the left) and Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13, Sec. 7 (on the right).

Proof
We spell out the existence of the idempotent adjunction (2):
First, to see we have an adjunction Dtplg⊣CdfflgDtplg \dashv Cdfflg, we check the hom-isomorphism (here).
Let X∈DiffeologicalSpacesX \in DiffeologicalSpaces and Y∈TopologicalSpacesY \in TopologicalSpaces. Write (−) s(-)_s for the underlying sets. Then a morphism, hence a continuous function of the form
f:Dtplg(X)⟶Y,
  f \;\colon\; Dtplg(X) \longrightarrow Y
  \,,


is a function f s:X s→Y sf_s \colon X_s \to Y_s of the underlying sets such that for every open subset A⊂Y sA \subset Y_s and every smooth function of the form ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X the preimage (f s∘ϕ s) −1(A)⊂ℝ n(f_s \circ \phi_s)^{-1}(A) \subset \mathbb{R}^n is open. But this means equivalently that for every such ϕ\phi, f∘ϕf \circ \phi is continuous. This, in turn, means equivalently that the same underlying function f sf_s constitutes a smooth function f˜:X⟶Cdfflg(Y)\widetilde f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Cdfflg(Y).
In summary, we thus have a bijection of hom-sets
Hom(Dtplg(X),Y) ≃ Hom(X,Cdfflg(Y)) f s ↦ (f˜) s=f s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(X), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(X, Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    f_s &\mapsto& (\widetilde f)_s = f_s
  }


given simply as the identity on the underlying functions of underlying sets. This makes it immediate that this hom-isomorphism is natural in XX and YY and this establishes the adjunction.
Next, to see that the D-topological spaces are the fixed points of this adjunction, we apply the above natural bijection on hom-sets to the case
Hom(Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)),Y) ≃ Hom(Cdfflg(Z),Cdfflg(Y)) (ϵ Z) s ↦ (id) s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(Cdfflg(Z), Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    (\epsilon_Z)_s &\mapsto& (\mathrm{id})_s
  }


to find that the counit of the adjunction
Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶ϵ XX
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \overset{\epsilon_X}{\longrightarrow}
  X


is given by the identity function on the underlying sets (ϵ X) s=id (X s)(\epsilon_X)_s = id_{(X_s)}.
Therefore η X\eta_X is an isomorphism, namely a homeomorphism, precisely if the open subsets of X sX_s with respect to the topology on XX are precisely those with respect to the topology on Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))Dtplg(Cdfflg(X)), which means equivalently that the open subsets of XX coincide with those whose pre-images under all continuous functions ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X are open. This means equivalently that XX is a D-topological space.
Finally, to see that we have an idempotent adjunction, it is sufficient to check (by this Prop.) that the comonad
Dtplg∘Cdfflg:TopologicalSpaces→TopologicalSpaces
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \;\colon\; TopologicalSpaces \to TopologicalSpaces


is an idempotent comonad, hence that
Dtplg∘Cdfflg⟶Dtplg⋅η⋅CdfflgDtplg∘Cdfflg∘Dtplg∘Cdfflg
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg
  \overset{
    Dtplg \cdot \eta \cdot Cdfflg
  }{\longrightarrow}
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \circ Dtplg \circ Cdfflg


is a natural isomorphism. But, as before for the adjunction counit ϵ\epsilon, we have that also the adjunction unit η\eta is the identity function on the underlying sets. Therefore, this being a natural isomorphism is equivalent to the operation of passing to the D-topological refinement of the topology of a topological space being an idempotent operation, which is clearly the case.


Further discussion of the D-topology is in CSW 13.

Remark
(diffeological singular simplicial set as path ∞-groupoid)
Regarding simplicial sets as presenting ∞-groupoids, we may think of Sing diff(X)Sing_{diff}(X) (Def. ) as the path ∞-groupoid of the diffeological space XX.
In fact, by the discussion at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid we have that Sing diffSing_{diff} is equvialent to the shape of diffeological spaces regarded as objects of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids:

Proposition

where smap\mathbf{smap} is some topologization of the set of maps (defined on their p. 6 ) of which all we need to know is that:

(shown on the left of (4)) it is weak homotopy equivalent, via some map ϕ\phi according to their Prop. 5.4 (p. 9) to the compact-open topology.

Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces

Proposition
The obvious functor from the category SmoothManifolds of smooth manifolds to the category DiffeologicalSpaces of diffeological spaces is a full and faithful functor
SmoothManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpacess.
  SmoothManifolds \hookrightarrow  DiffeologicalSpacess
  \,.



Proof
This is a direct consequence of the fact that CartSpsmooth_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothManifolds and the Yoneda lemma.
It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:
To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if f,g:X→Yf,g : X \to Y are two smooth functions that differ at some point, then they must differ in some open neighbourhood of that point. This open ball is a plot, hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that plot.
To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets f:X→Yf : X \to Y that sends plots to plots is necessarily a smooth function, hence that all its derivatives exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves γ:(0,1)→X\gamma : (0,1) \to X in XX. By Boman's theorem, a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular plots, so a function that takes all plots of XX to plots of YY must be smooth.


Remark
The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site CartSp dim≤1⊂CartSpCartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp on the objects ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0 and ℝ 1\mathbb{R}^1 and still have a full and faithful embedding
Diff↪Sh(CartSp dim≤1).
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.


This fact plays a role in the definition of Frölicher spaces, which are generalized smooth spaces defined by plots by curves into and out of them.
While the site CartSp dim≤1CartSp_{dim \leq 1} is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp dim≤1)Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1}) lacks some non-concrete sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree ≥2\geq 2.

in the evident way by taking for XX a Fréchet manifold for any U∈U \in  CartSp the set of UU-plots of ι(X)\iota(X) to be the set of smooth functions U→XU \to X.


Proposition
The functor ι:FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.

This appears as (Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1, following Losik 92), as variant of the analogous statement for Banach manifolds in (Hain). The fact that maps between Fréchet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in (Frölicher 81, théorème 1)
The statement is also implied by (Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14) which states that functions between locally convex vector spaces are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth curves to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses Michal-Bastiani smoothness (Glöckner 06), in which case one merely has a faithful functor lctvs→DiffeologicalSpaceslctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces. Notice that the choice of topology in (Kriegl-Michor 97) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fréchet manifolds.

Proposition
Let X,Y∈SmoothManifoldX, Y \in SmoothManifold with XX a compact manifold.
Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}:
ι(C ∞(X,Y) Fr)≃C ∞(X,Y) diff.
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.


This appears as (Waldorf 09, lemma A.1.7).

Embedding of diffeological spaces into smooth sets
We discuss how diffeological spaces are equivalently the concrete objects in the cohesive topos of smooth sets (see there).

Proposition
(diffeological spaces are the concrete smooth sets)
The full subcategory on the concrete objects in the topos SmoothSet≔Sh(Cart)SmoothSet \coloneqq Sh(Cart) of smooth sets is equivalent to the category of diffeological spaces


Proof
The concrete sheaves for the local topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are by definition those objects XX for which the (Γ⊣CoDisc)(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)-unit
X→CoDiscΓX
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X


is a monomorphism. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every U∈CartSpU \in CartSp we have that
X(U)≃Hom Sh(U,X)→Hom Sh(U,CodiscΓX)≃Hom Set(ΓU,ΓX)
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)


is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

For a fully detailed proof see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is a quasitopos.


Proof
This follows from the discussion at Locality.

This has some immediate general abstract consequences

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is


a cartesian closed category


a closed monoidal category.



Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the concrete objects is the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)≃Sh(SmthMfd)Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd) of smooth sets. This is a general context for differential geometry. From there one can pass further to higher differential geometry: the topos of smooth sets in turn embeds
Sh(CartSp)↪Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp)
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 


into the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of “higher smooth sets” –smooth ∞-groupoids – as precisely the 0-truncated objects.
Distribution theory
Since a space of smooth functions on a smooth manifold is canonically a diffeological space, it is natural to consider the smooth linear functionals on such mapping spaces. These turn out to be equivalent to the continuous linear functionals, hence to distributional densities. See at distributions are the smooth linear functionals for details.
The concept of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid or super smooth geometric homotopy type is the combination of super ∞-groupoid and smooth ∞-groupoid. The cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth super-∞\infty-groupoids is a context that realizes higher supergeometry.
Super smooth ∞\infty-groupoids include supermanifolds, super Lie groups and their deloopings etc. Under Lie differentiation these map to super L-∞ algebras.
We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) in some fine technical detail. The other is at smooth super infinity-groupoid.

Definition
Write


CartSp for the site of Cartesian spaces;


InfPoint≔WAlg opInfPoint \coloneqq WAlg^{op} for the category of first-order infinitesimally thickened points (i.e. the formal duals of commutative algebras over the real numbers of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R}\oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional square-0 nilpotent ideal).


SuperPoint≔WAlg super opSuperPoint \coloneqq WAlg_{super}^{op} for the category of superpoints, by which we here mean the formal duals to commutative superalgebras which are super-Weil algebras.


There are then “semidirect product” sites CartSp⋊InfinPointCartSp \rtimes InfinPoint and CartSp⋊SuperPointCartSp \rtimes SuperPoint (whose objects are Cartesian products of the given form inside synthetic differential supergeometry and whose morphisms are all morphisms in that context (not just the product morphisms)).
Set then
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊InfPoint)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes InfPoint)


for the collection of formal smooth ∞-groupoids (see there) and finally
SuperSmooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp⋊SuperPoint)
  SuperSmooth\infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp \rtimes SuperPoint)


for that of super smooth ∞\infty-groupoid

the first inclusion picks the terminal object ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0;


the second inclusion is that of reduced objects; the coreflection is reduction, sending an algebra to its reduced algebra;


the third inclusion is that of even-graded algebras, the reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its even-graded part, the co-reflection sends a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded algebra to its quotient by the ideal generated by its odd part, see at superalgebra – Adjoints to the inclusion of plain algebras.




Remark
Passing to (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-sheaves, this yields, via (∞,1)-Kan extension, a sequence of adjoint quadruples as follows:

Proposition
Passing to the adjoint triples of idempotent monads and idempotent comonads which this induces, then yields


on the left the shape modality ∫\int, flat modality ♭\flat and sharp modality ♯\sharp,


in the middle yields the reduction modality ℜ\Re, the infinitesimal shape modality ℑ\Im and the infinitesimal flat modality &\&.


on the right we get an adjoint triple whose whose middle bit ⇝\rightsquigarrow is the bosonic modality and whose left piece ⇉\rightrightarrows produces super-even components, containing all the “fermion currents” if one wishes , which in this unity of opposites hence deserves to be called the fermionic modality. The further right adjoint RhRh is the rheonomy modality.


Hence we get a process of adjoint modalities of the form
  id ⊣ id   ∨  ∨  fermionic ⇉ ⊣ ⇝ bosonic   ⊥  ⊥  bosonic ⇝ ⊣ Rh rheonomic   ∨  ∨  reduced ℜ ⊣ ℑ infinitesimal   ⊥  ⊥  infinitesimal ℑ ⊣ & étale   ∨  ∨  contractible ʃ ⊣ ♭ discrete   ⊥  ⊥  discrete ♭ ⊣ ♯ differential   ∨  ∨   ∅ ⊣ *
  \array{

    && \vee && \vee
    \\
    && \emptyset &\dashv& \ast
  }


where “∨\vee” denotes inclusion of modal types. The first level is cohesion, the second is differential cohesion (elasticity), the third is a further refinement given by supergeometry, which takes further “square roots” of all infinitesimal generators.


Proof
All the sites are ∞-cohesive sites, which gives that we have an cohesive (infinity,1)-topos. The composite inclusion on the right is an ∞-cohesive neighbourhood site, whence the inclusion Smooth∞Gpd↪SuperFormalSmooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Gpd\hookrightarrow SuperFormalSmooth\infty Grpd exhibits differential cohesion.
With this the rightmost adjoint quadruple gives the Aufhebung of ℜ⊣ℑ\Re \dashv \Im by ⇝⊣Rh\rightsquigarrow \dashv Rh and the further opposition ⇉⊣⇝\rightrightarrows \dashv \rightsquigarrow.

Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
The standard model of particle physics is a model (in particle physics): a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles currently experimentally known, containing

matter: electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other fermions,

as well as three of the four fundamental forces as currently known, which, somewhat roughly, are

force: the electroweak force (including electromagnetism) and the strong nuclear force.

It is defined as a local Lagrangian field theory which is an Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory.
The main ingredient missing from the standard model is the quantum version of the field of gravity. For decades, a large part of theoretical physics has been absorbed with attempts to understand how this last of the known fundamental forces might fit into the picture.
As a quantum field theory, the standard model is in particular a Yang–Mills gauge theory with spinors in Yang–Mills theory.
Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a quantum field theory is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model.
Gauge group
The exact gauge group of the standard model is not quite the product group
U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)


of the circle group with special unitary groups, but is the quotient group
(1)G SM=(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6
  
  G_{SM} 
  \;=\;
  \big(
    U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \big)
  / \mathbb{Z}_6


of that by a cyclic group ℤ 6⊂U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)\mathbb{Z}_6 \subset U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) which is the subgroup generated from an element of the form
(q 6,q 21 2,q 31 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3),
  (q_6, q_2 \mathbf{1}_2, q_3 \mathbf{1}_3) \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,,


where q n∈U(1)q_n \in U(1) denotes an nnth primitive root of unity, i.e.
(e 2πi16,e 2πi121 2,e 2πi131 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3).
  \left(
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{6}}
    \;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{2}} \mathbf{1}_2\;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{3}} \mathbf{1}_3
  \right) 
  \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,.


(See Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36 for a fairly comprehensive discussion. See also e.g. HMY 13, p. 2.)
Strikingly, this exact gauge group (1) of the standard model of particle physics happens to coincide with…


…the group
G SM≃S(U(2)×U(3))⊂SU(5)
   G_{SM} 
    \;\simeq\; 
   S\big(U(2) \times U(3)\big) 
    \;\subset\; 
   SU(5)


of determinant-1 elements in the direct product group U(2)×U(3)U(2) \times U(3), which makes manifest that the standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the simple Lie group SU(5).
This is the basis of “grand unified theories” (GUT), speculative extensions of the standard model trying to understand its gauge group as being a spontaneously broken simple Lie group-symmetry.


…the subgroup of the Jordan algebra automorphism group of the octonionic Albert algebra that “stabilizes a 4d sub-Minkowski spacetime” (see there for details).
More concretely, it is identified with the subgroup of Spin(9) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19, see also at SO(10)-GUT)


This is part of ongoing speculation that octonionic exceptional structures might be behind the standard model.

The standard model (in theoretical physics) for the observable universe on the largest length scales of cosmology:
it is an inflationary FRW spacetime with cosmological constant (“dark energy”) and cold dark matter. The technical term for this is the Λ\Lambda CDM concordance model (where “Λ\Lambda” is the standard symbol for the cosmological constant and “CDM” is for “cold dark matter”).
The current model assumes that the energy density of the observable universe consists of


4.9% baryonic (visible) matter


26.8% dark matter


68.3% dark energy.

Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry studying symplectic manifolds and some generalizations; it originated as a formalization of the mathematical apparatus of classical mechanics and geometric optics (and the related WKB-method in quantum mechanics and, more generally, the method of stationary phase in harmonic analysis). A wider branch including symplectic geometry is Poisson geometry and a sister branch in odd dimensions is contact geometry. A special and central role in the subject belongs to certain real-like half-dimensional submanifolds, called lagrangian (or Lagrangean) submanifolds, which are in some sense classical points. Symplectic geometry radically changed after the 1985 article of Mikhail Gromov on pseudoholomorphic curves and the subsequent work of Andreas Floer giving birth to symplectic topology or “hard methods” of symplectic geometry.
By quantization is meant some process that


reads in a system of classical mechanics, or rather of prequantum data in the form of an Lagrangian/action functional and or a phase space equipped with symplectic structure


and returns a corresponding system of quantum mechanics.


Motivation from classical mechanics and Lie theory
We indicate here a systematic motivation of quantization by looking at classical mechanics formalized as symplectic geometry from the point of view of Lie theory (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13, Nuiten 13).
\,
Quantization of course was and is motivated by experiment, hence by observation of the observable universe: it just so happens that quantum mechanics and quantum field theory correctly account for experimental observations where classical mechanics and classical field theory gives no answer or incorrect answers. A historically important example is the phenomenon called the “ultraviolet catastrophe”, a paradox predicted by classical statistical mechanics which is not observed in nature, and which is corrected by quantum mechanics.
But one may also ask, independently of experimental input, if there are good formal mathematical reasons and motivations to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. Could one have been led to quantum mechanics by just pondering the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics? (Hence more precisely: is there a natural Synthetic Quantum Field Theory?)
The following spells out an argument to this effect. It will work for readers with a background in modern mathematics, notably in Lie theory, and with an understanding of the formalization of classical/prequantum mechanics in terms of symplectic geometry.
So to briefly recall, a system of classical mechanics/prequantum mechanics is a phase space, formalized as a symplectic manifold (X,ω)(X, \omega). A symplectic manifold is in particular a Poisson manifold, which means that the algebra of functions on phase space XX, hence the algebra of classical observables, is canonically equipped with a compatible Lie bracket: the Poisson bracket. This Lie bracket is what controls dynamics in classical mechanics. For instance if H∈C ∞(X)H \in C^\infty(X) is the function on phase space which is interpreted as assigning to each configuration of the system its energy – the Hamiltonian function – then the Poisson bracket with HH yields the infinitesimal time evolution of the system: the differential equation famous as Hamilton's equations.
Something to take notice of here is the infinitesimal nature of the Poisson bracket. Generally, whenever one has a Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, then it is to be regarded as the infinitesimal approximation to a globally defined object, the corresponding Lie group (or generally smooth group) GG. One also says that GG is a Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} and that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is the Lie differentiation of GG.
Therefore a natural question to ask is: Since the observables in classical mechanics form a Lie algebra under Poisson bracket, what then is the corresponding Lie group?
The answer to this is of course “well known” in the literature, in the sense that there are relevant monographs which state the answer. But, maybe surprisingly, the answer to this question is not (at time of this writing) a widely advertized fact that has found its way into the basic educational textbooks. The answer is that this Lie group which integrates the Poisson bracket is the “quantomorphism group”, an object that seamlessly leads to the quantum mechanics of the system.
Before we spell this out in more detail, we need a brief technical aside: of course Lie integration is not quite unique. There may be different global Lie group objects with the same Lie algebra.
The simplest example of this is already one of central importance for the issue of quantization, namely, the Lie integration of the abelian line Lie algebra ℝ\mathbb{R}. This has essentially two different Lie groups associated with it: the simply connected translation group, which is just ℝ\mathbb{R} itself again, equipped with its canonical additive abelian group structure, and the discrete quotient of this by the group of integers, which is the circle group
U(1)=ℝ/ℤ.
  U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


Notice that it is the discrete and hence “quantized” nature of the integers that makes the real line become a circle here. This is not entirely a coincidence of terminology, but can be traced back to the heart of what is “quantized” about quantum mechanics.
Namely, one finds that the Poisson bracket Lie algebra 𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)\mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) of the classical observables on phase space is (for XX a connected manifold) a Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra 𝔥𝔞𝔪(X)\mathfrak{ham}(X) of Hamiltonian vector fields on XX by the line Lie algebra:
ℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X).
  \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X)
  \,.


This means that under Lie integration the Poisson bracket turns into an central extension of the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of (X,ω)(X,\omega). And either it is the fairly trivial non-compact extension by ℝ\mathbb{R}, or it is the interesting central extension by the circle group U(1)U(1). For this non-trivial Lie integration to exist, (X,ω)(X,\omega) needs to satisfy a quantization condition which says that it admits a prequantum line bundle. If so, then this U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group Ham(X,ω)Ham(X,\omega) of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms exists and is called… the quantomorphism group QuantMorph(X,ω)QuantMorph(X,\omega):
U(1)⟶QuantMorph(X,ω)⟶Ham(X,ω).
  U(1) \longrightarrow QuantMorph(X,\omega) \longrightarrow Ham(X,\omega)
  \,.


While important, for some reason this group is not very well known, which is striking because it contains a small subgroup which is famous in quantum mechanics: the Heisenberg group.
More precisely, whenever (X,ω)(X,\omega) itself has a compatible group structure, notably if (X,ω)(X,\omega) is just a symplectic vector space (regarded as a group under addition of vectors), then we may ask for the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which covers the (left) action of phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega) on itself. This is the corresponding Heisenberg group Heis(X,ω)Heis(X,\omega), which in turn is a U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group XX itself:
U(1)⟶Heis(X,ω)⟶X.
  U(1) \longrightarrow Heis(X,\omega) \longrightarrow X
  \,.


At this point it is worth pausing for a second to note how the hallmark of quantum mechanics has appeared as if out of nowhere simply by applying Lie integration to the Lie algebraic structures in classical mechanics:
if we think of Lie integrating ℝ\mathbb{R} to the interesting circle group U(1)U(1) instead of to the uninteresting translation group ℝ\mathbb{R}, then the name of its canonical basis element 1∈ℝ1 \in \mathbb{R} is canonically “ii”, the imaginary unit. Therefore one often writes the above central extension instead as follows:
iℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X,ω)
  i \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X,\omega)


in order to amplify this. But now consider the simple special case where (X,ω)=(ℝ 2,dp∧dq)(X,\omega) = (\mathbb{R}^2, d p \wedge d q) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space which is for instance the phase space of the particle propagating on the line. Then a canonical set of generators for the corresponding Poisson bracket Lie algebra consists of the linear functions pp and qq of classical mechanics textbook fame, together with the constant function. Under the above Lie theoretic identification, this constant function is the canonical basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R}, hence purely Lie theoretically it is to be called “ii”.
With this notation then the Poisson bracket, written in the form that makes its Lie integration manifest, indeed reads
[q,p]=i.
  [q,p] = i
  \,.


Since the choice of basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R} is arbitrary, we may rescale here the ii by any non-vanishing real number without changing this statement. If we write “ℏ\hbar” for this element, then the Poisson bracket instead reads
[q,p]=iℏ.
  [q,p] = i \hbar
  \,.


This is of course the hallmark equation for quantum physics, if we interpret ℏ\hbar here indeed as Planck's constant. We see it arises here merely by considering the non-trivial (the interesting, the non-simply connected) Lie integration of the Poisson bracket.
This is only the beginning of the story of quantization, naturally understood and indeed “derived” from applying Lie theory to classical mechanics. From here the story continues. It is called the story of geometric quantization. We close this motivation section here by some brief outlook.
The quantomorphism group which is the non-trivial Lie integration of the Poisson bracket is naturally constructed as follows: given the symplectic form ω\omega, it is natural to ask if it is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)U(1)-principal connection ∇\nabla on complex line bundle LL over XX (this is directly analogous to Dirac charge quantization when instead of a symplectic form on phase space we consider the the field strength 2-form of electromagnetism on spacetime). If so, such a connection (L,∇)(L, \nabla) is called a prequantum line bundle of the phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega). The quantomorphism group is simply the automorphism group of the prequantum line bundle, covering diffeomorphisms of the phase space (the Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms mentioned above).
As such, the quantomorphism group naturally acts on the space of sections of LL. Such a section is like a wavefunction, except that it depends on all of phase space, instead of just on the “canonical coordinates”. For purely abstract mathematical reasons (which we won’t discuss here, but see at motivic quantization for more) it is indeed natural to choose a “polarization” of phase space into canonical coordinates and canonical momenta and consider only those sections of the prequantum line bundle which depend only on the former. These are the actual wavefunctions of quantum mechanics, hence the quantum states. And the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which preserves these polarized sections is the group of exponentiated quantum observables. For instance in the simple case mentioned before where (X,ω)(X,\omega) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space, this is the Heisenberg group with its famous action by multiplication and differentiation operators on the space of complex-valued functions on the real line.
Quantization of field theory
An interesting subclass of quantum field theories, especially of perturbative quantum field theories, is thought to arise from prequantum field theory via a process of quantization. This process reads in certain – usually differential geometric – data (Lagrangian field theory), interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some physical system, and spits out the perturbative quantum field theory that encodes the time evolution of this system.
For more on this see at Wick algebra and causal perturbation theory.
Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as “classical physics”. The true dynamics in turn is “quantum physics”.
In view of this, quantization is often understood as a right inverse to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its classical limit. As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists. Additional structures sometimes make it unique.

These traditional formulations are geared towards mechanics (as opposed to field theory). Even in that restricted application, it seems that a more comprehensive understanding is still missing

The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of quantization.
(Gukov-Witten 08, p.4)

In the context of field theory the conceptual issues become even more severe. For example the class of field theories called Yang-Mills theory is a core ingredient in the standard model of particle physics but the quantization of Yang-Mills theory (see there for more) poses famous open problems – of which of course that there isn’t yet a comprehensive theory of what this even means is not the least.



A topological manifold XX of dimension n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} is by definition a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to a Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n. A choice of such morphism
ϕ:ℝ n→≃X| im(ϕ)↪X
  \phi : \mathbb{R}^n \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X|_{im(\phi)} \hookrightarrow X


is a coordinate system or coordinate chart or just chart on the image of ϕ\phi.
This generalises to other sorts of manifolds.
An atlas is the collection of coordinate charts defining a manifold structure.

A differentiable manifold is a topological space which is locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space (a topological manifold) and such that the gluing functions which relate these Euclidean local charts to each other are differentiable functions, for a fixed degree of differentiability. If one considers arbitrary differentiablity, then one speaks of smooth manifolds. For a general discussion see at manifold.
Differential and smooth manifolds are the basis for much of differential geometry. They are the analogs in differential geometry of what schemes are in algebraic geometry.
If one relaxes the condition from being locally isomorphic to a Euclidean space to admitting local smooth maps from a Euclidean space, then one obtains the concept of diffeological spaces or even smooth sets, see at generalized smooth space for more on this.
The generalization of differentiable manifolds to higher differential geometry are orbifolds and more generally differentiable stacks. If one combines this with the generalization to smooth sets then one obtains the concept of smooth stacks and eventually smooth infinity-stacks.
Smooth manifolds form a category, SmoothManifolds.
Traditional definition
For the traditional definition see at differentiable manifold.
Patching as idempotent splitting
In an exercise of his 1973 Perugia lectures F. William Lawvere reported a somewhat surprising observation:
In the case of smooth manifolds the process of piecing together the local data can be elegantly summed up as splitting of idempotents in a category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces. More precisely:
Let DiffDiff be the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, where by a “smooth manifold”, we mean a finite-dimensional, second-countable, Hausdorff, C ∞C^\infty manifold without boundary. Let i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff be the full subcategory whose objects are the open subspaces of finite-dimensional Cartesian spaces.

Theorem
The subcategory i:Open↪Diffi: Open \hookrightarrow Diff exhibits DiffDiff as an idempotent-splitting completion of OpenOpen.


Proof
By a general lemma for idempotent splittings, it suffices to prove that


Every smooth manifold is a smooth retract of an open set in Euclidean space;


If p:U→Up : U \to U is a smooth idempotent on an open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, then the subset Fix(p)↪UFix(p) \hookrightarrow U is an embedded submanifold.


For the first statement, we use the fact that any manifold MM can be realized as a closed submanifold of some ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, and every closed submanifold has a tubular neighborhood U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n. In this case UU carries a structure of vector bundle over MM in such a way that the inclusion M↪UM \hookrightarrow U is identified with the zero section, so that the bundle projection U→MU \to M provides a retraction, with right inverse given by the zero section.
For the second statement, assume that the origin 00 is a fixed point of pp, and let T 0(U)≅ℝ nT_0(U) \cong \mathbb{R}^n be its tangent space (observe the presence of a canonical isomorphism to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n). Thus we have idempotent linear maps dp(0),Id−dp(0):T 0(U)→T 0(U)d p(0), Id-d p(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(U) where the latter factors through the inclusion kerdp(0)↪T 0(U)\ker \; d p(0) \hookrightarrow T_0(U) via a projection map π:T 0(U)→kerdp(0)\pi: T_0(U) \to \ker \; d p(0). We have a map f:U→ℝ nf: U \to \mathbb{R}^n that takes x∈Ux \in U to x−p(x)x - p(x); let gg denote the composite
U⟶fℝ n≅T 0(U)⟶πkerdp(0).U \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{R}^n \cong T_0(U) \stackrel{\pi}{\longrightarrow} \ker\; d p(0).
Now we make some easy observations:


Fix(p)⊆g −1(0)Fix(p) \subseteq g^{-1}(0).


The map p:U→Up: U \to U restricts to a map p:g −1(0)→g −1(0)p: g^{-1}(0) \to g^{-1}(0), by idempotence of pp.


The derivative dg(0):T 0(U)→T 0(kerdp(0))≅kerdp(0)d g(0): T_0(U) \to T_0(\ker \; d p(0)) \cong \ker \; d p(0) is π\pi again since Id−dp(0)Id - d p(0) is idempotent. Thus dg(0)d g(0) has full rank (mm say), and so the restriction of gg to some neighborhood VV has 00 as a regular value, and g −1(0)∩Vg^{-1}(0) \cap V is a manifold of dimension mm by the implicit function theorem. The tangent space T 0(g −1(0)∩V)T_0(g^{-1}(0) \cap V) is canonically identified with im(dp(0))im(d p(0)).


There are smaller neighborhoods V″⊆V′⊆VV'' \subseteq V' \subseteq V so that pp restricts to maps p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 as in the following diagram (i,i′,i″i, i', i'' are inclusion maps, all taking a domain element xx to itself):
g −1(0)∩V″ ↪i″ g −1(0) p 2↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V′ ↪i′ g −1(0) p 1↓  ↓ p g −1(0)∩V ↪i g −1(0)\array{
g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' & \stackrel{i''}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_2} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V' & \stackrel{i'}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0) \\ 
_\mathllap{p_1} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{p} \\ 
g^{-1}(0) \cap V & \stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} & g^{-1}(0)
}

and such that p 1,p 2p_1, p_2 are diffeomorphisms by the inverse function theorem (noting here that dp i(0):im(dp(0))→im(dp(0))d p_i(0): im(d p(0)) \to im(d p(0)) is the identity map, by idempotence of pp).


Letting q:g −1(0)∩V′→g −1(0)∩V″q: g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \to g^{-1}(0) \cap V'' denote the smooth inverse to p 2p_2, we calculate i′=p∘i″∘qi' = p \circ i'' \circ q, and
ip 1=pi′=ppi″q=pi″q=i′,i p_1 = p i' = p p i''q = p i'' q = i',
so that p 1(x)=xp_1(x) = x for every x∈g −1(0)∩V′x \in g^{-1}(0) \cap V'. Hence g −1(0)∩V′⊆Fix(p)g^{-1}(0) \cap V' \subseteq Fix(p).


From all this it follows that Fix(p)∩V′=g −1(0)∩V′Fix(p) \cap V' = g^{-1}(0) \cap V', meaning Fix(p)Fix(p) is locally diffeomorphic to ℝ m\mathbb{R}^m, and so Fix(p)Fix(p) is an embedded submanifold of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.


Remark
Another proof of this result may be found here.

Lawvere comments on this fact as follows:

 “This powerful theorem justifies bypassing the complicated considerations of charts, coordinate transformations, and atlases commonly offered as a ”basic“ definition of the concept of manifold. For example the 2-sphere, a manifold but not an open set of any Euclidean space, may be fully specified with its smooth structure by considering any open set AA in 3-space EE which contains it but not its center (taken to be 00) and the smooth idempotent endomap of AA given by e(x)=x/|x|e(x) = x/{|x|}. All general constructions (i.e., functors into categories which are Cauchy complete) on manifolds now follow easily (without any need to check whether they are compatible with coverings, etc.) provided they are known on the opens of Euclidean spaces: for example, the tangent bundle on the sphere is obtained by splitting the idempotent e′e' on the tangent bundle A×VA \times V of AA (VV being the vector space of translations of EE) which is obtained by differentiating ee. The same for cohomology groups, etc.” (Lawvere 1989, p.267)

General abstract geometric definition
There is a fundamental and general abstract way to think of smooth manifolds, which realizes their theory as a special case of general constructions in higher geometry.
In this context one specifies for instance 𝒢\mathcal{G} a geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) and then plenty of geometric notions are defined canonically in terms of 𝒢\mathcal{G}. The theory of smooth manifolds appears if one takes 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp.
Alternatively one can specify differential cohesion and proceed as discussed at differential cohesion – structures - Cohesive manifolds (separated).
This is discussed in The geometry CartSp below.
The geometry CartSpCartSp
Let CartSp be the category of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them. This has finite products and is in fact (the syntactic category) of a Lawvere theory: the theory of smooth algebras.
Moreover, CartSpCartSp is naturally equipped with the good open cover coverage that makes it a site.
Both properties together make it a pregeometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) (if the notion of Grothendieck topology is relaxed to that of coverage in StrSp).
For 𝒳\mathcal{X} a topos, a product-preserving functor
𝒪:𝒢→𝒳
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{X}


is a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. This makes 𝒳\mathcal{X} is 𝒢\mathcal{G}-ringed topos. For 𝒢=\mathcal{G} =  CartSp this algebra is a smooth algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}. If 𝒳\mathcal{X} has a site of definition XX, then this is a sheaf of smooth algebras on XX.
If 𝒪\mathcal{O} sends covering families {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} in 𝒢\mathcal{G} to effective epimorphism ∐ i𝒪(U i)→𝒪(U)\coprod_i \mathcal{O}(U_i) \to \mathcal{O}(U) we say that it is a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra in 𝒳\mathcal{X}, making 𝒳\mathcal{X} a 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally ringed topos.
The big topos Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) itself is canonically equipped with such a local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra, given by the Yoneda embedding jj followed by sheafification LL
𝒪:𝒢→jPSh(𝒢)→LSh(𝒢).
  \mathcal{O} : \mathcal{G} \stackrel{j}{\to} PSh(\mathcal{G}) \stackrel{L}{\to}
  Sh(\mathcal{G})
  \,.


It is important in the context of locally representable locally ringed toposes that we regard Sh(𝒢)Sh(\mathcal{G}) as equipped with this local 𝒢\mathcal{G}-algebra. This is what remembers the site and gives a notion of local representability in the first place.
The big topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is a cohesive topos of generalized smooth spaces. Its concrete sheaves are precisely the diffeological spaces. See there for more details. We now discuss how with Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) regarded as a CartSpCartSp-structured topos, smooth manifolds are precisely its locally representable objects.
Cartesian spaces as representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)
The representables themselves should evidently be locally representable and canonically have the structure of CartSpCartSp-structured toposes.
Indeed, every object U∈CartSpU \in \mathrm{CartSp} is canonically a CartSp-ringed space, meaning a topological space equipped with a local sheaf of smooth algebras. More generally: every object U∈CartSpU \in CartSp is canonically incarnated as the CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos

Smooth manifolds as locally representable objects of Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp)

Definition
Say a concrete object XX in the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) – a diffeological space – is locally representable if there exists a family of open embeddings {U i↪X} i∈X\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}_{i \in X} with U i∈CartSp↪jSh(CartSp)U_i \in CartSp \stackrel{j}{\hookrightarrow} Sh(CartSp) such that the canonical morphism out of the coproduct
∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_i U_i \to X


is an effective epimorphism in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp).
Let LocRep(CartSp)↪Sh(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) be the full subcategory on locally representable sheaves.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of categories
Diff≃LocRep(CartSp)
  Diff \simeq LocRep(CartSp)


of the category Diff of smooth manifolds with that of locally representable sheaves for the pre-geometry CartSpCartSp.


Proof
Define a functor Diff→LocRep(CartSp)Diff \to LocRep(CartSp) by sending each smooth manifold to the sheaf over CartSpCartSp that it naturally represents. By definition of manifold there is an open cover {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\}. We claim that ∐ iU i→X\coprod_i U_i \to X is an effective epimorphism, so that this functor indeed lands in LocRep(CartSp)LocRep(CartSp). (This is a standard argument of sheaf theory in Diff, we really only need to observe that it goes through over CartSp, too.)
For that we need to show that
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to X


is a coequalizer diagram in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) (that the Cech groupoid of the cover is equivalent to XX.). Notice that the fiber product here is just the intersection in XX U i× XU j≃U i∩U jU_i \times_X U_j \simeq U_i \cap U_j. By the fact that the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) is by definition a reflective subcategory of the presheaf topos PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) we have that colimits in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are computed as the sheafification of the corresponding colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). The colimit in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp) in turn is computed objectwise. Using this, we see that that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→S({U i})
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_i U_i \to S(\{U_i\})


in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp), where S({U i})S(\{U_i\}) is the sieve corresponding to the cover: the subfunctor S({U i})↪XS(\{U_i\}) \hookrightarrow X of the functor X:CartSp op→SetX : CartSp^{op} \to Set  which assigns to V∈CartSpV \in CartSp the set of smooth functions V→XV \to X that have the property that they factor through any one of the U iU_i.
Essentially by the definition of the coverage on CartSpCartSp, it follows that sheafification takes this subfunctor inclusion to an isomorphism. This shows that XX is indeed the tip of the coequalizer in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) as above, and hence that it is a locally representable sheaf.
Conversely, suppose that for X∈Conc(Sh(CartSp))↪Sh(CartSp)X \in Conc(Sh(CartSp)) \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) there is a family of open embeddings {U i↪X}\{U_i \hookrightarrow X\} such that we have a coequalizer diagram
∐ i,jU i× XU j⟶⟶∐ iU i→X
  \coprod_{i, j} U_i \times_X U_j \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \coprod_{i} U_i \to X


in Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp), which is the sheafification of the corresponding coequalizer in PSh(CartSp)PSh(CartSp). By evaluating this on the point, we find that the underlying set of XX is the coequalizer of the underlying set of the U iU_i in SetSet. Since every plot of XX factors locally through one of the U iU_i it follows that XX is a diffeological space.
It follows that in the pullback diagrams
U i× XU j → U j ↓  ↓ U i → X
  \array{
    U_i \times_X U_j &\to& U_j
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   U_i &\to& X 
  }


the object U i∩U jU_i \cap U_j is the diffeological space whose underlying topological space is the intersection of U iU_i and U jU_j in the topological space underlying XX. In particular the inclusions U i× XU j↪U iU_i \times_X U_j \hookrightarrow U_i are open embeddings.

As locally representable CartSpCartSp-structured (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
We may switch from regarding smooth manifolds as objects in the big topos X∈Sh(CartSp)X \in Sh(CartSp) to regrading them as toposes themselves, by passing to the over-topos Sh(CartSp)/XSh(CartSp)/X. This remembers the extra (smooth) structure on the topological space XX by being canonically a locally ringed topos with the structure sheaf of smooth functions on XX: a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-toposes
For every choice of geometry (for structured (∞,1)-toposes) there is a notion of 𝒢\mathcal{G}-locally representable structured (∞,1)-topos (StrSp).

Claim
Smooth manifolds are equivalently the 0-localic CartSp-generalized schemes of locally finite presentation.


Sketch of proof
The statement says that a smooth manifold XX may be identified with an ∞-stack on CartSp (an ∞-Lie groupoid) which is represented by a CartSp-structured (∞,1)-topos (𝒳,𝒪 𝒳)(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{X}}) such that


𝒳\mathcal{X} is a 0-localic (∞,1)-topos;


There exists a family of objects {U i∈𝒳}\{U_i \in \mathcal{X}\} such that the canonical morphism ∐ iU i→* 𝒳\coprod_i U_i \to *_{\mathcal{X}} to the terminal object in 𝒳\mathcal{X} is a regular epimorphism;


For every i∈Ii \in I there is an equivalence

(from the category of smooth manifolds to the opposite category of commutative algebras over the real numbers) that sends a smooth manifold XX to its commutative ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra of smooth functions X→ℝX \to \mathbb{R} is a fully faithful functor, hence exhibits SmthMfdSmthMfd as a full subcategory of cAlg opcAlg^{op}.

derivations of smooth functions are vector fields


The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}

Classically, we have:

A Grothendieck topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} is a category that admits a geometric embedding
𝒯↪←lexPSh(C)
  \mathcal{T} \stackrel{\stackrel{lex}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)


in a presheaf category, i.e., a full and faithful functor that has a left exact left adjoint.
This is equivalently the category of sheaves (Set-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a small site.

See at sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes for discussion of this characterization.
Since smallness can be relative, we also have:

For a given fixed category of sets SS, a Grothendieck topos over SS is a category of sheaves (SS-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a site which is small relative to SS, that is a site internal to SS.

Note that a Grothendieck topos is a topos because (or if) SS is.
The site is not considered part of the structure; different sites may give rise to equivalent category of sheaves.
By the general theory of geometric morphisms, every Grothendieck topos sits inside a category of presheaves by a geometric embedding Sh(S)↪PSh(S)Sh(S) \hookrightarrow PSh(S).


This may be taken as an alternative definition of sheaf: since Lawvere-Tierney topologies are bijectively given by geometric embeddings, instead of explicitly defining a sheaf as a presheaf satisfying descent, one may define categories of sheaves as geometric embeddings into presheaf categories.


For details on the relation between the two perspectives see geometric embedding.


This perspective is useful for defining the vertical categorification of sheaves: stacks and ∞-stacks: the higher categories of these may be defined as geometric embeddings into higher categories of presheaves. This has been worked out in detail for (∞,1)-categories. See (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves.


Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between petit topos and gros topos.


General

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a locally presentable category.

(Borceux 94, vol 3, prop. 3.4.16)

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a total category and a cototal category.


Proof
From the page total category, totality follows from the fact that a Grothendieck topos is

Cocomplete,
Well-copowered (because quotient objects of an object XX are in bijection with equivalence relations on XX, and there is a small set of these because a Grothendieck topos is well-powered), and
Has a generator (e.g., the coproduct of all representables for a small site presentation).

Dually, a Grothendieck topos is

Complete,
Well-powered (because subobjects of an object XX are in bijection with elements of a small hom-set hom(X,Ω)\hom(X, \Omega)), and
Has a cogenerator (e.g., the product of power objects Ω c\Omega^c where cc ranges over representables for a small site presentation).

Therefore a Grothendieck topos is also cototal.

Giraud's axiomatic characterization
Giraud characterized Grothendieck toposes as categories satisfying certain exactness and small completeness properties (where “small” is again relative to the given category of sets SS). The exactness properties are elementary (not depending on SS), and are satisfied in any elementary topos, or even a pretopos.
Giraud's theorem characterises a Grothendieck topos as follows:

a locally small category with a small generating set,
with all finite limits,
with all small coproducts, which are disjoint, and pullback-stable,
where all congruences have effective quotient objects, which are also pullback-stable.

These conditions are equivalent to

a locally small infinitary pretopos with a small generating set.

See the Elephant, theorem C.2.2.8. (There, the assumption of local smallness is not stated explicitly, but it is included in the definition of ∞\infty-pretopos by way of well-poweredness; on the nLab it is not so included, so we have to state it explicitly. To see that it is necessary, note that if UU and VV are Grothendieck universes with U∈VU\in V, then Set VSet_V satisfies all the other conditions relative to Set USet_U, but is not locally small and is not a Grothendieck topos.) See also Wikipedia.
Sometimes (3,4) are combined and strengthened to the statement that the category has all small colimits, which are effective and pullback-stable. However, this is a mistake for two reasons: it is a significantly stronger axiomatisation (since without the small generating set, not every infinitary pretopos has this property), and it is not valid in weak foundations (while the definition given above is).
Street’s axiomatic characterization
Augmenting the aforementioned Proposition  that Grothendieck toposes are total categories, Street more or less characterizes Grothendieck toposes as lex total categories having the same “size” as SetSet.
In more detail: we take as background set theory ZFC + “there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal” κ\kappa; equivalently, the existence of a single Grothendieck universe UU (a set of “small sets”). Supposing given a model VV of ZFC+universeZFC+universe, “category” shall then refer to category theory interpreted in VV. Let SetSet be the category of small sets; note that the set of morphisms of SetSet has size κ\kappa.
Recall that locally small category EE is lex total if the Yoneda embedding y:E→[E op,Set]y: E \to [E^{op}, Set] has a left exact left adjoint.

Theorem
(Street) A category EE is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is κ\kappa or less.


Remark
This result is in the spirit of saying “every Grothendieck topos is the category of sheaves with respect to the canonical topology on itself”. Putting aside set-theoretic issues, it suggests that Grothendieck toposes be seen as analogous to frames, which may be defined as lex total objects in 2\mathbf{2}-CatCat. In this setting, the appropriate morphisms are left exact left adjoints, so that Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms between them would be analogous to locales and continuous maps between them.
One can deduce formally that lex total categories are locally cartesian closed Heyting pretoposes.

As lex reflections of categories of presheaves
sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes
As localic groupoids
Every Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the classifying topos of a localic groupoid, every Grothendieck topos with enough points is equivalent to the classifying topos of a topological groupoid, and in fact the 2-category Topos of Grothendieck toposes is equivalent to a localization of that of localic groupoids.
See at classifying topos of a localic groupoid for more.
Internal logic
Being an elementary topos, a Grothendieck has an internal logic that can be taken to be higher-order logic or a form of dependent type theory. It is also useful to take its internal geometric logic, in particular because that is preserved by geometric morphisms and because every geometric theory has a Grothendieck classifying topos.
Although the internal logic of a Grothendieck topos is constructive logic, there are a number of principles that are true in every Grothendieck topos (at least, assuming the base topos Set is classical) but are not constructively provable (and in particular can fail in other toposes). Roughly speaking, many of these axioms assert that classicality fails “in only a small way”. These include:

WISC: every set has a weakly initial set of covers.
The (constructive) axiom of multiple choice (AMC).
The axiom of stack completions.
(allegedly) the local small cardinality selection axiom (SCSA).
Every complete small category is a preorder.

A diffeological space is a type of generalized smooth space. As with the other variants, it subsumes the notion of smooth manifold but also naturally captures other spaces that one would like to think of as smooth spaces but aren’t manifolds; for example, the space of all smooth maps between two smooth manifolds can be made into a diffeological space. (These mapping spaces are rarely manifolds themselves, see manifolds of mapping spaces.)
In a little more detail, a diffeology, 𝒟\mathcal{D} on a set XX is a presheaf on the category of open subsets of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps as morphisms. To each open set U⊆ℝ nU \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, it assigns a subset of Set(U,X)\Set(U,X). The functions in Set(U,X)\Set(U,X) are to be regarded as the “smooth functions” from UU to XX. A diffeological space is then a set together with a diffeology on it.
Diffeological spaces were originally introduced in (Souriau 79). They have subsequently been developed in the textbook (Iglesias-Zemmour 13)

Definition
Let 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} denote the site whose objects are the open subsets of the Euclidean spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and whose morphisms are smooth maps between these. The Grothendieck topology on 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} is generated by the coverage of open covers, i.e., a family of maps {U i→X} i∈I\{U_i\to X\}_{i\in I} is a covering family if every map U i→XU_i\to X is an open embedding and the union of the images of U iU_i in XX equals XX.
A diffeological space is a pair (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) where


XX is a set


and 𝒟∈Sh(𝒪𝓅)\mathcal{D} \in Sh(\mathcal{Op}) is a diffeology on XX:


a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦Hom Set(U,X)U \mapsto Hom_{Set}(U,X) with 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X


equivalently: a concrete sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} such that 𝒟(*)=X\mathcal{D}(*) = X - a concrete smooth space (see there for more details).




A morphism of diffeological spaces is a morphism of the corresponding sheaves: we take DiffeologicalSp↪Sh(CartSp)DiffeologicalSp \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp) to be the full subcategory on the diffeological spaces in the sheaf topos.

For (X,𝒟)(X,\mathcal{D}) a diffeological space, and for any U∈𝒪𝓅U \in \mathcal{Op}, the set 𝒟(U)\mathcal{D}(U) is also called the set of plots in XX on UU. This is to be thought of as the set of ways of mapping UU smoothly into the would-be space XX. This assignment defined what it means for a map U→XU \to X of sets to be smooth.
For some comments on the reasoning behind this kind of definition of generalized spaces see motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks.
A sheaf on the site 𝒪𝓅\mathcal{Op} of open subsets of Euclidean spaces is completely specified by its restriction to CartSp, the full subcategory of Cartesian space: The fully faithful functor CartSp↪𝒪𝓅CartSp \hookrightarrow \mathcal{Op} is a dense subsite-inclusion. Therefore in the sequel we shall often restrict our attention to CartSp.
One may define a smooth sets to be any sheaf of CartSp. A diffeological space is equivalently a concrete sheaf on the concrete site CartSp. (For details see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.)
The full subcategory
DiffeologicalSpaces↪Sh(CartSp)
  DiffeologicalSpaces \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp)


on all concrete sheaves is not a topos, but is a quasitopos.
This is Prop.  below.
The concreteness condition on the sheaf is a reiteration of the fact that a diffeological space is a subsheaf of the sheaf U↦X |U|U \mapsto X^{|U|}. In this way, one does not have to explicitly mention the underlying set XX as it is determined by the sheaf on the one-point open subset of ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0.
Relation to topological and Δ\Delta-generated spaces


Proposition
(adjunction between topological spaces and diffeological spaces)
There is a pair of adjoint functors
(1)TopSpAA⊥AA⟶Cdfflg⟵DtplgDifflgSp
  
  TopSp
  \underoverset{
    \underset{
      Cdfflg

  DifflgSp


between the categories of TopologicalSpaces and of DiffeologicalSpaces, where


CdfflgCdfflg takes a topological space XX to the continuous diffeology, namely the diffeological space on the same underlying set X sX_s whose plots U s→X sU_s \to X_s are the continuous functions (from the underlying topological space of the domain UU).


DtplgDtplg takes a diffeological space to the diffeological topology (D-topology), namely the topological space with the same underlying set X sX_s and with the final topology that makes all its plots U s→X sU_{s} \to X_{s} into continuous functions: called the D-topology.
Hence a subset O⊂♭XO \subset \flat X is an open subset in the D-topology precisely if for each plot f:U→Xf \colon U \to X the preimage f −1(O)⊂Uf^{-1}(O) \subset U is an open subset in the Cartesian space UU.


Moreover:


the fixed points of this adjunction X∈X \inTopologicalSpaces (those for which the counit is an isomorphism, hence here: a homeomorphism) are precisely the Delta-generated topological spaces (i.e. D-topological spaces):
XisΔ-generated⇔Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶≃ϵ XX

  \;\;\;\;\;
  \Leftrightarrow
  \;\;\;\;\;
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \underoverset{\simeq}{\;\;\epsilon_X\;\;}{\longrightarrow}
  X



this is an idempotent adjunction, which exhibits Δ\Delta-generated/D-topological spaces as a reflective subcategory inside diffeological spaces and a coreflective subcategory inside all topological spaces:

  DiffeologicalSpaces


Finally, these adjunctions are a sequence of Quillen equivalences with respect to the:
classical model structure on topological spacesmodel structure on D-topological spacesmodel structure on diffeological spaces


Caution: There was a gap in the original proof that DTopologicalSpaces≃ QuillenDiffeologicalSpacesDTopologicalSpaces \simeq_{Quillen} DiffeologicalSpaces. The gap is claimed to be filled now, see the commented references here.


Essentially these adjunctions and their properties are observed in Shimakawa, Yoshida & Haraguchi 2010, Prop. 3.1, Prop. 3.2, Lem. 3.3, see also Christensen, Sinnamon & Wu 2014, Sec. 3.2. The model structures and Quillen equivalences are due to Haraguchi 13, Thm. 3.3 (on the left) and Haraguchi-Shimakawa 13, Sec. 7 (on the right).

Proof
We spell out the existence of the idempotent adjunction (2):
First, to see we have an adjunction Dtplg⊣CdfflgDtplg \dashv Cdfflg, we check the hom-isomorphism (here).
Let X∈DiffeologicalSpacesX \in DiffeologicalSpaces and Y∈TopologicalSpacesY \in TopologicalSpaces. Write (−) s(-)_s for the underlying sets. Then a morphism, hence a continuous function of the form
f:Dtplg(X)⟶Y,
  f \;\colon\; Dtplg(X) \longrightarrow Y
  \,,


is a function f s:X s→Y sf_s \colon X_s \to Y_s of the underlying sets such that for every open subset A⊂Y sA \subset Y_s and every smooth function of the form ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X the preimage (f s∘ϕ s) −1(A)⊂ℝ n(f_s \circ \phi_s)^{-1}(A) \subset \mathbb{R}^n is open. But this means equivalently that for every such ϕ\phi, f∘ϕf \circ \phi is continuous. This, in turn, means equivalently that the same underlying function f sf_s constitutes a smooth function f˜:X⟶Cdfflg(Y)\widetilde f \;\colon\; X \longrightarrow Cdfflg(Y).
In summary, we thus have a bijection of hom-sets
Hom(Dtplg(X),Y) ≃ Hom(X,Cdfflg(Y)) f s ↦ (f˜) s=f s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(X), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(X, Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    f_s &\mapsto& (\widetilde f)_s = f_s
  }


given simply as the identity on the underlying functions of underlying sets. This makes it immediate that this hom-isomorphism is natural in XX and YY and this establishes the adjunction.
Next, to see that the D-topological spaces are the fixed points of this adjunction, we apply the above natural bijection on hom-sets to the case
Hom(Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)),Y) ≃ Hom(Cdfflg(Z),Cdfflg(Y)) (ϵ Z) s ↦ (id) s
  \array{
    Hom( Dtplg(Cdfflg(Z)), Y )
    &\simeq&
    Hom(Cdfflg(Z), Cdfflg(Y))
    \\
    (\epsilon_Z)_s &\mapsto& (\mathrm{id})_s
  }


to find that the counit of the adjunction
Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))⟶ϵ XX
  Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))
  \overset{\epsilon_X}{\longrightarrow}
  X


is given by the identity function on the underlying sets (ϵ X) s=id (X s)(\epsilon_X)_s = id_{(X_s)}.
Therefore η X\eta_X is an isomorphism, namely a homeomorphism, precisely if the open subsets of X sX_s with respect to the topology on XX are precisely those with respect to the topology on Dtplg(Cdfflg(X))Dtplg(Cdfflg(X)), which means equivalently that the open subsets of XX coincide with those whose pre-images under all continuous functions ϕ:ℝ n→X\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X are open. This means equivalently that XX is a D-topological space.
Finally, to see that we have an idempotent adjunction, it is sufficient to check (by this Prop.) that the comonad
Dtplg∘Cdfflg:TopologicalSpaces→TopologicalSpaces
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \;\colon\; TopologicalSpaces \to TopologicalSpaces


is an idempotent comonad, hence that
Dtplg∘Cdfflg⟶Dtplg⋅η⋅CdfflgDtplg∘Cdfflg∘Dtplg∘Cdfflg
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg
  \overset{
    Dtplg \cdot \eta \cdot Cdfflg
  }{\longrightarrow}
  Dtplg \circ Cdfflg \circ Dtplg \circ Cdfflg


is a natural isomorphism. But, as before for the adjunction counit ϵ\epsilon, we have that also the adjunction unit η\eta is the identity function on the underlying sets. Therefore, this being a natural isomorphism is equivalent to the operation of passing to the D-topological refinement of the topology of a topological space being an idempotent operation, which is clearly the case.


Further discussion of the D-topology is in CSW 13.

Remark
(diffeological singular simplicial set as path ∞-groupoid)
Regarding simplicial sets as presenting ∞-groupoids, we may think of Sing diff(X)Sing_{diff}(X) (Def. ) as the path ∞-groupoid of the diffeological space XX.
In fact, by the discussion at shape via cohesive path ∞-groupoid we have that Sing diffSing_{diff} is equvialent to the shape of diffeological spaces regarded as objects of the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞-groupoids:

(shown on the left of (4)) it is weak homotopy equivalent, via some map ϕ\phi according to their Prop. 5.4 (p. 9) to the compact-open topology.

Embedding of smooth manifolds into diffeological spaces

Proposition
The obvious functor from the category SmoothManifolds of smooth manifolds to the category DiffeologicalSpaces of diffeological spaces is a full and faithful functor
SmoothManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpacess.
  SmoothManifolds \hookrightarrow  DiffeologicalSpacess
  \,.



Proof
This is a direct consequence of the fact that CartSpsmooth_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothManifolds and the Yoneda lemma.
It may nevertheless be useful to spell out the elementary proof directly:
To see that the functor is faithful, notice that if f,g:X→Yf,g : X \to Y are two smooth functions that differ at some point, then they must differ in some open neighbourhood of that point. This open ball is a plot, hence the corresponding diffeological spaces differ on that plot.
To see that the functor is full, we need to show that a map of sets f:X→Yf : X \to Y that sends plots to plots is necessarily a smooth function, hence that all its derivatives exist. This can be tested already on all smooth curves γ:(0,1)→X\gamma : (0,1) \to X in XX. By Boman's theorem, a function that takes all smooth curves to smooth curves is necessarily a smooth function. But curves are in particular plots, so a function that takes all plots of XX to plots of YY must be smooth.


Remark
The proof shows that we could restrict attention to the full sub-site CartSp dim≤1⊂CartSpCartSp_{dim \leq 1} \subset CartSp on the objects ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0 and ℝ 1\mathbb{R}^1 and still have a full and faithful embedding
Diff↪Sh(CartSp dim≤1).
  Diff \hookrightarrow Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1})
  \,.


This fact plays a role in the definition of Frölicher spaces, which are generalized smooth spaces defined by plots by curves into and out of them.
While the site CartSp dim≤1CartSp_{dim \leq 1} is more convenient for some purposes, it is not so useful for other purposes, mostly when diffeological spaces are regarded from the point of view of the full sheaf topos: the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp dim≤1)Sh(CartSp_{dim \leq 1}) lacks some non-concrete sheaves of interest, such as the sheaves of differential forms of degree ≥2\geq 2.

Embedding of smooth manifolds with boundary into diffeological spaces

Proposition
(manifolds with boundaries and corners form full subcategory of diffeological spaces)
The evident functor
SmthMfdWBdrCrn↪AAAADiffeologicalSpaces
  SmthMfdWBdrCrn \overset{\phantom{AAAA}}{\hookrightarrow} DiffeologicalSpaces


from the category of smooth manifolds with boundaries and corners to that of diffeological spaces is fully faithful, hence is a full subcategory-embedding.

(Iglesias-Zemmour 13, 4.16, Gürer & Iglesias-Zemmour 19)
Embedding of Banach manifolds into diffeological spaces
Also Banach manifolds embed fully faithfully into the category of diffeological spaces. In (Hain) this is discussed in terms of Chen smooth spaces.
Embedding of Fréchet manifolds into diffeological spaces
We discuss a natural embedding of Fréchet manifolds into the category of diffeological spaces.

Definition
Define a functor
ι:FrechetManifolds→DiffeologicalSpaces
  \iota \colon FrechetManifolds \to DiffeologicalSpaces


in the evident way by taking for XX a Fréchet manifold for any U∈U \in  CartSp the set of UU-plots of ι(X)\iota(X) to be the set of smooth functions U→XU \to X.


Proposition
The functor ι:FrechetManifolds↪DiffeologicalSpaces\iota \colon FrechetManifolds \hookrightarrow DiffeologicalSpaces is a full and faithful functor.

This appears as (Losik 94, theorem 3.1.1, following Losik 92), as variant of the analogous statement for Banach manifolds in (Hain). The fact that maps between Fréchet spaces are smooth if and only if they send smooth curves to smooth curves was proved earlier in (Frölicher 81, théorème 1)
The statement is also implied by (Kriegl-Michor 97, cor. 3.14) which states that functions between locally convex vector spaces are diffeologically smooth precisely if they send smooth curves to smooth curves. This is not true if one uses Michal-Bastiani smoothness (Glöckner 06), in which case one merely has a faithful functor lctvs→DiffeologicalSpaceslctvs \to DiffeologicalSpaces. Notice that the choice of topology in (Kriegl-Michor 97) is such that this equivalence of notions reduces to the above just for Fréchet manifolds.

Proposition
Let X,Y∈SmoothManifoldX, Y \in SmoothManifold with XX a compact manifold.
Then under this embedding, the diffeological mapping space structure C ∞(X,Y) diffC^\infty(X,Y)_{diff} on the mapping space coincides with the Fréchet manifold structure C ∞(X,Y) FrC^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr}:
ι(C ∞(X,Y) Fr)≃C ∞(X,Y) diff.
  \iota(C^\infty(X,Y)_{Fr})
  \simeq
  C^\infty(X,Y)_{diff}
  \,.


This appears as (Waldorf 09, lemma A.1.7).

Embedding of diffeological spaces into smooth sets
We discuss how diffeological spaces are equivalently the concrete objects in the cohesive topos of smooth sets (see there).

Proposition
(diffeological spaces are the concrete smooth sets)
The full subcategory on the concrete objects in the topos SmoothSet≔Sh(Cart)SmoothSet \coloneqq Sh(Cart) of smooth sets is equivalent to the category of diffeological spaces


Proof
The concrete sheaves for the local topos Sh(CartSp)Sh(CartSp) are by definition those objects XX for which the (Γ⊣CoDisc)(\Gamma \dashv CoDisc)-unit
X→CoDiscΓX
  X \to CoDisc \Gamma X


is a monomorphism. Monomorphisms of sheaves are tested objectwise, so that means equivalently that for every U∈CartSpU \in CartSp we have that
X(U)≃Hom Sh(U,X)→Hom Sh(U,CodiscΓX)≃Hom Set(ΓU,ΓX)
  X(U) \simeq Hom_{Sh}(U,X) \to Hom_{Sh}(U, Codisc \Gamma X)
  \simeq Hom_{Set}(\Gamma U, \Gamma X)


is a monomorphism. This is precisely the condition on a sheaf to be a diffeological space.

For a fully detailed proof see this Prop. at geometry of physics – smooth sets.

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is a quasitopos.


Proof
This follows from the discussion at Locality.

This has some immediate general abstract consequences

Corollary
The category of diffeological spaces is


a cartesian closed category


a closed monoidal category.



Embedding of diffeological spaces into higher differential geometry
In the last section we saw the embedding of diffeological spaces as precisely the concrete objects is the sheaf topos Sh(CartSp)≃Sh(SmthMfd)Sh(CartSp) \simeq Sh(SmthMfd) of smooth sets. This is a general context for differential geometry. From there one can pass further to higher differential geometry: the topos of smooth sets in turn embeds
Sh(CartSp)↪Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh ∞(CartSp)
  Sh(CartSp) \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd \coloneqq Sh_\infty(CartSp) 


into the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of “higher smooth sets” –smooth ∞-groupoids – as precisely the 0-truncated objects.
Distribution theory
Since a space of smooth functions on a smooth manifold is canonically a diffeological space, it is natural to consider the smooth linear functionals on such mapping spaces. These turn out to be equivalent to the continuous linear functionals, hence to distributional densities. See at distributions are the smooth linear functionals for details.
Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
The concept of smooth groupoid is the first generalization of the concept of smooth sets (smooth spaces) to higher differential geometry, it is a joint generalization of smooth sets (smooth manifolds, diffeological spaces, …), orbifolds and Lie groupoids, hence it also subsumes deloopings of Lie groups and diffeological groups. It also subsumes smooth moduli stacks, for instance of gauge fields.
Technically, a smooth groupoid is a groupoid-valued stack on the site of smooth manifolds (sometimes called a “smooth stack”, but this is somewhat ambiguous), or equivalently on its dense subsite CartSp of just Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them. This is equivalently an 1-truncated smooth ∞-groupoid.
For more see also at geometry of physics – smooth homotopy types.

Remark
on how not to define smooth groupoids
One could be tempted to define smooth groupoids to be internal groupoids in smooth sets. Restricting this definition to groupoids internal to diffeological spaces yields the concept of diffeological groupoid, restricting it further to groupoids internal to smooth manifolds yields the concept of Lie groupoid. While these are respectable definitions in themselves, care needs to be exercised in interpreting them correctly: they do not in themselves exhibit the correct homotopy theory of smooth groupoids. One may fix this by changing the concept of morphisms to generalized morphisms called Morita morphisms or bibundles. These are certainly useful tools for working with smooth groupoids, and they serve to present their correct homotopy theory, but they do not serve well as the definition of this homotopy theory. For instance without further insight it is impossible to guess from the concept of bibundles between groupoids its correct generalization to smooth 2-groupoids etc.
But just as the definition of smooth sets, contrasted with that of smooth manifolds, is not only more powerful but also simpler, so there is a definition of smooth groupoids which not only does give the correct homotopy theory, but it does so while being much more transparent than these more traditional presentations.
Now, this definition, given below, amounts to saying that smooth groupoids are stacks on the site of smooth manifolds, and that in turn may tend to not sound like a simple definition at all. But there is a further simplification at work. Traditional texts tend to define stacks in terms of the comparatively intricate structures of pseudofunctors or (dually under the Grothendieck construction) fibered categories satisfying descent, and the rich structure of these combinatorial objects tends to become unwieldy already for fairly simple examples. But the theory of localization of categories turns out to handle the same theory of stacks by much more tractable means (e.g. Hollander 01). Here a stack is presented by a plain functor with no descent condition imposed, something that is hence as simple as a pair of two presheaves. The nature of stacks is then instead just encoded in remembering that some of the morphisms of presheaves of groupoids are to be labeled as weak equivalences, namely those that locally restrict to equivalences of groupoids.
This style of definition combines the simplicity of the naive definition of Lie groupoids with the full power of homotopy theory, and it immediately generalizes to a definition of ∞-stacks which is just as simple, hence, in the present context, to a definition of smooth ∞-groupoid.

Pre-smooth groupoids

Definition
Write CartSp for the category of Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, with smooth functions between them. (The full subcategory of SmoothMfd on the Cartesian spaces.) Regard this as a site by equipping it with the coverage of (differentiably) good open covers.

For more on this see at geometry of physics – coordinate systems.
In view of the motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks and in direct analogy with the discussion at geometry of physics – smooth sets, just replacing sets by groupoids throughout, we set:

Definition
A pre-smooth groupoid XX is a presheaf of groupoids on CartSp, hence a functor
X:CartSp op⟶Grpd
  X \colon CartSp^{op} \longrightarrow Grpd


from CartSp to the 1-category Grpd.

See at geometry of physics – homotopy types – groupoids for more on bare groupoids. Here we will freely assume familiarity with these.

Remark
The intuition for def.  is the following: a smooth structure on a groupoid is to be determined by which maps from abstract coordinate systems ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n into it are to be regarded as smooth maps. Since, by its groupoidal nature, two such maps may be related by a smooth homotopy/gauge transformation (in physics: “twisted sectors”), the collection of all smooth functions from ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n into the smooth groupoid XX is itself a bare groupoid. We here define a pre-smooth groupoid as something that assigns to each abstract coordinate systems a groupoid of would-be smooth maps into it
“X(ℝ n)={ ↗↘ smooth ℝ n ⇓ X  ↘↗ smooth}X(\mathbb{R}^n) = \left\{ \array{
     & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{smooth}}
     \\
    \mathbb{R}^n
    &\Downarrow&
    X
    \\
    & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{smooth}}
 } \right\}”
We sometimes therefore speak of X(ℝ n)X(\mathbb{R}^n) as the groupoid of plots or of probes of XX (which here is only defined by these!) by nn-dimensional coordinate systems.

The Yoneda lemma will turn this intuition into a theorem. For that we need to speak of homomorphisms of pre-smooth groupoids, hence of “smooth functors” betwen pre-smooth groupoids.

Definition
A homomorphism or smooth map between pre-smooth groupoids is a natural transformation between the presheaves that they are. We write
PreSmooth1Type≔Funct(CartSp op,Grpd)
  PreSmooth1Type
  \coloneqq
  Funct(CartSp^{op}, Grpd)


for the functor category, the category of pre-smooth groupoids, def. , regarded naturally as a Grpd-enriched category.
This means that for X,Y∈PreSmooth1TypeX,Y \in PreSmooth1Type two pre-smooth groupoids, then the bare hom-groupoid
PreSmooth1Type(X,Y) •∈Grpd
  PreSmooth1Type(X,Y)_\bullet
  \in 
  Grpd


between them has


as objects the natural transformations f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y between XX and YY regarded as functors, hence collections {f(ℝ n)} n∈ℕ\{f(\mathbb{R}^n)\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}} of functors between groupoids of probes
f(ℝ n):X(ℝ n)⟶Y(ℝ n)
   f(\mathbb{R}^n) \colon X(\mathbb{R}^n) \longrightarrow Y(\mathbb{R}^n)


such that for every smooth function ϕ:ℝ n 1→ℝ n 2\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2} between abstract coordinate charts, these form a (strictly) commuting diagram with the probe-pullback functors of XX and YY:
X(ℝ n 1) ⟶f(ℝ n) Y(ℝ n 1)  X(ϕ)↓  ↓ Y(ϕ) X(ℝ n 2) ⟶f(ℝ n) Y(ℝ n 2);
  \array{
     X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1}) &\overset{f(\mathbb{R}^n)}{\longrightarrow}& Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{X(\phi)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y(\phi)}}
     \\
     X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) &\overset{f(\mathbb{R}^n)}{\longrightarrow}& Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})       
  }
  \,;



as morphisms H:f→gH \colon f \rightarrow g the “modifications” of these, hence collections H(ℝ n):f(ℝ n)→g(ℝ n)H(\mathbb{R}^n) \colon f(\mathbb{R}^n)\to g(\mathbb{R}^n) of natural transformations, such that for every smooth function ϕ:ℝ n 1→ℝ n 2\phi \colon \mathbb{R}^{n_1} \to \mathbb{R}^{n_2} the whiskering of these satisfies
X(ℝ n 1) ↓ X(ϕ)  ↗↘ f(ℝ n 2) X(ℝ n 2) ⇓ H(ℝ n 2) Y(ℝ n 2)  ↘↗ g(ℝ n 1)= ↗↘ f(ℝ n 1) X(ℝ n 1) ⇓ H(ℝ n 1) Y(ℝ n 1)  ↘↗ g(ℝ n 1)   ↓ Y(ϕ)   Y(ℝ n 2)
  \array{
     X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
     \\
     \downarrow^{\mathrlap{X(\phi)}}
     \\
     & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{f(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})}}
     \\
     X(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})
     &\Downarrow^{H(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})}&
     Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_2})
     \\
     & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})}}
  }
  \;\;\;
  =
  \;\;\;
  \array{
     & \nearrow \searrow^{\mathrlap{f(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})}}
     \\
     X(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
     &\Downarrow^{H(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})}&
     Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})
     \\
     & \searrow \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g(\mathbb{R}^{n_1})}}
     \\
     && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{Y(\phi)}}
     \\
     && Y(\mathbb{R}^{n_2}) 
  }





Remark
Despite the size of the diagrams in def. , what they encode is immediate: this just says that smooth maps between pre-smooth groupoids take all probes of XX by abstract coordinate charts to probes of YY by these charts, and take gauge transformations between these to gauge transformations between those, in a way that it compatible with changing probes along smooth maps.

The following is the Yoneda lemma in this context, and it says that this intuition in remark  is fully correct:

Proposition
Every Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n defines a pre-smooth groupoid ℝ̲ n\underline{\mathbb{R}}^n, def. , by the assignment
ℝ̲ n:ℝ k↦C ∞(ℝ k,ℝ n)∈Set↪Grpd
  \underline{\mathbb{R}}^n \colon \mathbb{R}^k  \mapsto C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^k, \mathbb{R}^n)
   \in 
  Set
  \hookrightarrow
  Grpd


where the set of smooth functions on the right is regarded as a groupoid with only identity morphisms. This construction constitutes a fully faithful functor
(−)̲:CartSp↪PreSmooth1Type
  \underline{(-)}
  \colon
  CartSp \hookrightarrow PreSmooth1Type


making CartSp a full subcategory of that of pre-smooth groupoids (the Yoneda embedding). Under this embedding for any pre-smooth groupoid X∈PreSmooth1TypeX\in PreSmooth1Type and any Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, there is a natural equivalence of groupoids
PreSmooth1Type(ℝ̲ n,X)≃X(ℝ n)
  PreSmooth1Type(\underline{\mathbb{R}}^n, X)
  \simeq
  X(\mathbb{R}^n)


(the Yoneda lemma proper).


Remark
The last statement of the Yoneda lemma in prop.  expresses just the intuition of remark  and justifies removing the quotation marks displayed there. It also justifies dropping the extra underline denoting the Yoneda embedding. We will freely identify from now on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n with the pre-smooth groupoid that it represents.


Example
For XX a smooth set (e.g. a smooth manifold), hence in particular a functor
X:CartSp op→Set
  X \colon CartSp^{op} \to Set


then its embedding into groupoids
X:CartSp op→Set↪Grpd
  X \colon CartSp^{op} \to Set \hookrightarrow Grpd


is a pre-smooth groupoid.

More generally:

Example
Let
𝒢 •={𝒢 1⟶t⟵i⟶s𝒢 0}
  \mathcal{G}_\bullet
  = 
  \left\{
    \mathcal{G}_1
      \stackrel{\overset{s}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{t}{\longrightarrow}}}
    \mathcal{G}_0
  \right\}


be an internal groupoid in smooth sets, hence a pair 𝒢 0,𝒢 1∈Smooth0Type\mathcal{G}_0, \mathcal{G}_1 \in Smooth0Type of smooth sets, equipped with source, target, identity homomorphisms of smooth sets between them, and equipped with a compatibly unital, associative and invertible composition map 𝒢 1×𝒢 0𝒢 1→𝒢 1\mathcal{G}_1 \underset{\mathcal{G}_0}{\times} \mathcal{G}_1 \to \mathcal{G}_1. By definition of smooth sets, this means that for every abstract coordinate system ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n then
𝒢(ℝ n) •={𝒢(ℝ n) 1⟶t(ℝ n)⟵i(ℝ n)⟶s(ℝ n)𝒢(ℝ n) 0}
  \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)_\bullet
  = 
  \left\{
    \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)_1
      \stackrel{\overset{s(\mathbb{R}^n)}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i(\mathbb{R}^n)}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{t(\mathbb{R}^n)}{\longrightarrow}}}
    \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)_0
  \right\}


is a bare groupoid. Moreover, this assignment is functorial and hence defines a pre-smooth groupoid
ℝ n↦𝒢(ℝ n) •.
  \mathbb{R}^n 
  \mapsto
  \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^n)_\bullet
  \,.


This exhibits sequence of full subcategory inclusions
Grp↪LieGrpd↪DiffGrpd↪Grpd(Smooth0Type)↪PreSmooth1Type
  Grp
  \hookrightarrow
  LieGrpd
  \hookrightarrow
  DiffGrpd
  \hookrightarrow
  Grpd(Smooth0Type)
  \hookrightarrow
  PreSmooth1Type


of internal groupoids in smooth sets into pre-smooth groupoids, and hence (by further restriction) also of diffeological groupoids, of Lie groupoids and of course of just bare groupoids, too.
Regarding a bare groupoid 𝒢 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet as a pre-smooth groupoid this way means to regard it as equipped with discrete smooth structure. It is given by the constant presheaf
ℝ n↦𝒢 •
  \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathcal{G}_\bullet


exhibiting the fact that smooth functions from an ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n into a geometrically discrete space are constant on one of the points of this space, a situation which here is only refined by the fact that every morphism in the groupoid thus gives a homotopy/gauge transformation between the two smooth functions that are constant on the two endpoints of this morphism.

A particular case of this of special importance is this:

Example
For GG a Lie group, we write (BG) •∈Grpd(Smooth0Type)(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet \in Grpd(Smooth0Type) for the Lie groupoid which
(BG) •=(G⟶⟵i⟶*)
  (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
  =
  \left(
     G \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\overset{i}{\longleftarrow}}{\longrightarrow}}
    \ast
  \right)


whose composition is the product operation in the group (the groupoidal delooping of GG). The pre-smooth groupoid that this corresponds to under the embedding of example  has groupoids of probes of the form
ℝ n↦B(C ∞(ℝ n,G) disc)
  \mathbb{R}^n 
   \mapsto 
   B \left(C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n,G)_{disc}\right)


where on the right we have the homotopy 1-type whose fundamental group is that of smooth GG-valued functions on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, under pointwise mulitplication.

More specifically, the following class of examples plays a special role in the theory, as the encode what it takes for a pre-smooth groupoid to be a genuinely smooth groupoid.

Example
For XX a smooth manifold, let {U i→X} i∈I\{U_i \to X\}_{i \in I} be an open cover of XX. Its Cech groupoid is the Lie groupoid (diffeological groupoid) C({U i}) •C(\{U_i\})_\bullet whose


manifold of objects is C({U i}) 0≔∐i∈IU iC(\{U_i\})_0 \coloneqq \underset{i \in I}{\coprod} U_i is the disjoint union of all the charts of the cover;


manifold of morphisms is C({U i}) 1≔∐i,j∈IU i×XU jC(\{U_i\})_1 \coloneqq  \underset{i,j \in I}{\coprod}U_i \underset{X}{\times} U_j is the disjoint union of all intersections of charts.


and whose source, target and identity maps are the evident inclusions. There is then a unique composition operation.
So a global point *→C({U i}) •\ast \to C(\{U_i\})_\bullet may be thought of as a pair (x,i)(x,i) of a point in the manifold XX and a label ii of a chart U iU_i that contains it, and there is is precisely one morphism between two such global point (x,i)→(y,j)(x,i)\to (y,j) whenever x=yx = y in XX and both U iU_i as well as U jU_j contain xx, hence one morphism for each point in an intersection of two patches. Composition of morphism is just re-remembering which intersections they sit in, the schematic picture of the Cech groupoid is this this:
C({U i}) •={  (x,j)  ↗  ↘ (x,i)  ⟶  (x,k)}.
  C(\{U_i\})_\bullet
  =
  \left\{
    \array{
      && (x,j)
      \\
      & \nearrow && \searrow
      \\
      (x,i)
      && \longrightarrow &&
      (x,k)
    }
  \right\}
  \,.


Under the embedding of example  there is an evident morphism of pre-smooth groupoids
C({U i})⟶X
  C(\{U_i\})
  \longrightarrow
  X


from this Cech groupoid of the cover to the manifold that is being covered. This morphism simply forgets the information of which chart or intersection of charts a point is regarded to be in, and just remembers it as a point of XX.
((x,i)→(x,j))↦(x→id xx).
  ((x,i) \to (x,j))
  \mapsto
  (x \stackrel{id_x}{\to} x)
  \,.



Proposition
Let XX a smooth manifold, {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} an open cover and C({U i})C(\{U_i\}) the corresponding Cech groupoid, def. . Let GG be a Lie group and BG\mathbf{B}G its groupoidal delooping according to example .
Then the hom-groupoid PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),BG)PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbf{B}G) of maps from C({U i})C(\{U_i\}) to BG\mathbf{B}G, def. , has


as objects the Cech cocycles of degree 1 on XX relative to the cover and with values in GG; i.e. collections of smooth functions
g ij:U i×XU j⟶G
  g_{ i j} \;\colon\; U_i \underset{X}{\times} U_j \longrightarrow G


satisfying on each triple intersection the cocycle condition
g ijg jk=g ik
  g_{i j} g_{j k} = g_{i k}



as morphisms the coboundaries between such cocycles {g ij}\{g_{i j}\} and {g˜ jk}\{\tilde g_{j k}\}, hence collections of smooth functions
h i:U i⟶G
  h_{i} \colon U_i \longrightarrow G


such that on each intersection of charts
g ijh j=h ig˜ ij.
  g_{i j} h_j  = h_i \tilde g_{i j}
  \,.



In particular the connected components of the Hom-groupoid is hence the Cech cohomology itself:
π 0PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),BG)≃H Cech 1(X,{U i};G). 
  \pi_0
  PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}), \mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  H^1_{Cech}(X,\{U_i\}; G)
  \,.



Proof
It is a matter of unwinding the definitions that the statement holds disregarding smooth structure everywhere, hence after evaluating the morphisms of pre-smooth groupoids on ℝ 0\mathbb{R}^0. That the component functions that one finds this way all have to be smooth then follows componentwise with the Yoneda lemma for presheaves of sets on CartSpCartSp (as discussed at geometry of physics – smooth sets).

Gluing
The “bootstrap”-definition of pre-smooth groupoids above works as intended, by prop. , it just needs to be restricted now to something a little less general. The issue is that while this definition consistently identifies a smooth-structure-to-be by what its possible smooth probes are, it does not enforce yet the consistent gluing of probes:
for XX a pre-smooth groupoid, then given a probe of it of the form σ:ℝ n→X\sigma \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to X and given a covering {U i→ℝ n}\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\} of the probe space by other probe spaces U i≃ℝ nU_i \simeq \mathbb{R}^n, then it should be possible to reconstruct σ\sigma from knowing its restrictions σ |U i:U i→X\sigma_{|U_i}\colon U_i \to X to these charts, and the information of how these are identified by gauge transformations on double overlaps.
Such a system of local data and of gauge identification on double overlaps is just what maps out of the Cech groupoid C({U i})C(\{U_i\}), def. , encode. This is shown by prop.  for the case that XX is of the form (BG) •(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet, example , but this is already the archetypical case.
In other words, the condition that smooth probes of XX by coordinate charts ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n glue along covers {U i→ℝ n}\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\} of these charts is the condition that the groupoid of smooth maps out of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n itself
ℝ n⟶X
  \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow X


is equivalent to the groupoid of maps out of the Cech groupoid of any cover
C({U i})⟶X

Definition
A pre-smooth groupoid X∈PreSmooth1TypeX \in PreSmooth1Type, def. , satisfies descent if for all n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and for all differentiably good open covers {U i→ℝ n}\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\} of the nn-dimensional abstract coordinate chart, the functor
X(ℝ n)≃PreSmooth1Type(ℝ n,X)⟶PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),X)
  X(\mathbb{R}^n) \simeq PreSmooth1Type(\mathbb{R}^n, X)
  \longrightarrow
  PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}),X)


given by pre-composition with C({U i})→ℝ nC(\{U_i\}) \to \mathbb{R}^n, is an equivalence of groupoids.


Remark
The condition in def.  is called the stack condition, or the condition of descent, alluding to the fact that it says that XX “descends” down along the cover projection. So a smooth groupoid is a stack on the site CartSp. This is a higher analog of the sheaf condition (see the next example) and hence a more systematic terminology would be to say that such XX is a 2-sheaf or rather a (2,1)-sheaf (since it takes values in groupoids as opposed to in more general categories).


Proposition
Let X∈PreSmooth0Type↪PreSmooth1TypeX \in PreSmooth0Type \hookrightarrow PreSmooth1Type be a pre-smooth groupoid which is really just a pre-smooth set, hence a presheaf on CartSpCartSp that takes values in groupoids with only identity morphisms
X:CartSp op⟶Set↪Grp.
  X \colon CartSp^{op} \longrightarrow Set \hookrightarrow Grp
  \,.


Then XX is a smooth groupoid in the sense of def.  precisely if it is a smooth set, hence precisely if, as a presheaf, it satisfies the sheaf condition.


Example
In particular, for X∈SmoothMfd↪PreSmooth0Type↪PreSmooth1TypeX \in SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow PreSmooth0Type \hookrightarrow PreSmooth1Type a smooth manifold, it satisfies descent as a pre-smooth groupoid.


Remark
There is an alternative formulation of the whole theory where instead of the site CartSp one uses the site SmoothMfd of all smooth manifolds. Everything discussed so far goes through verbatim for that site, too, but then the descent condition in def.  is a much stronger condition.
For instance the presheaves of the form (BG) •=(G⟶⟶*)(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet = (G \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} \ast) from example  satisfy descent on CartSpCartSp, but not all SmoothMfdSmoothMfd. Still, once we have defined the higher category of smooth groupoids, the definition will be equivalent for both choices of sites.
The choice of the smaller site is the one that is easier to work with, and therefore we stick with that. In fact, most every example of a pre-smooth groupoid that one runs into satisfies descent on CartSpCartSp.

For example:

Proposition
For GG a Lie group, then the pre-smooth delooping groupoid (BG) •(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet of example  satisfies descent on CartSpCartSp, def. .


Proof
For {U i→ℝ n}\{U_i \to \mathbb{R}^n\} a differentiably good open cover, then by prop.  the groupoid PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),(BG) •)PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}),(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet) is the groupoid of Cech 1-cocycles and coboundaries with coeffcients in GG on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n relative to the cover. But this is equivalently the groupoid of GG-principal bundles on ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n. Now because the underlying topological space of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n is contractible, all GG-principal bundles on it are equivalent to the trivial one. But this is evidently represented by the image of point under the map
B(C ∞(G) disc)≃PreSmooth1Type(ℝ n,(BG) •)⟶PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),(BG) •).
  B (C^\infty(G)_{disc})
  \simeq
  PreSmooth1Type(\mathbb{R}^n, (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet)
  \longrightarrow
  PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}), (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet)
  \,.


Therefore this is an essentially surjective functor of groupoids. Moreover, the automorphisms of the trivial GG-principal bundles are precisely the smooth GG-functions, hence this is also a fully faithful functor of groupoids. Accordingly it is an equivalence of groupoids.

The same argument however shows that on the larger site SmoothMfd this object does not satisfy descent. Put positively, this is the content of prop. . below.
Weak equivalences
While the morphisms of pre-smooth groupoids defined above correctly encode morphisms of smooth structures (by taking smooth probes compatibly to smooth probes), they are not sensitive enough yet to the required concept of equivalence. This is because smooth structure, being about existence of differentiation, is to be detected entirely locally, namely stalk-wise. If for instance XX is a smooth manifold, then its smooth structure is determined, around any of its points, by the smooth structure of an arbitrarily small open ball around that point.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, and 0<r<1∈ℝ0 \lt r \lt 1 \in \mathbb{R} let
ℝ n≃D r n↪ℝ n
  \mathbb{R}^n \simeq D^n_r \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n


be the smooth function that regards the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as the standard nn-disk of radius rr around the origin in ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.
For X∈PreSmooth1TypeX \in PreSmooth1Type we write
(D n) *X≔lim⟶ rX(D r n)∈Grpd
  (D^n)^* X \coloneqq {\underset{\longrightarrow_r}{\lim}} X(D^n_r) \in Grpd


for the colimit (in the 1-category of groupoids) of the restrictions of its groupoids of plots along the inclusion of these open balls – the nn-stalk of XX. This extends to a functor
(D n) *:PreSmooth1Type⟶Grpd
  (D^n)^* \colon PreSmooth1Type \longrightarrow Grpd


This means that objects in (D n) *X(D^n)^\ast X are equivalence classes of pairs (r,x r)(r,x_r) where 0<r<10 \lt r \lt 1 and where x r∈X(D r n)x_r \in X(D^n_r), with two such pairs being equivalent (r 1,x r 1)∼(r 2,x r 2)(r_1, x_{r_1})\sim (r_2, x_{r_2}) precisely if there is r 0<r 1,r 2r_0 \lt r_1,r_2 such that x r 1x_{r_1} becomes equal to x r 2x_{r_2} after restriction to D r 0 nD^n_{r_0}.

Definition
A morphism f:X⟶Yf \colon X \longrightarrow Y of pre-smooth groupoids, def. , is called a local weak equivalence if for every n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} the nn-stalk, def. , is an equivalence of groupoids
((D n) *f):(D n) *X⟶(D n) *Y.
  ((D^n)^* f) \colon (D^n)^* X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} (D^n)^* Y
  \,.


We write X⟶≃YX\stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} Y for local weak equivalences of pre-smooth groupoids. We will mostly just say weak equivalence for short.

Proposition
For XX a smooth manifold and {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} an open cover for it, then the canonical morphism from the corresponding Cech groupoid to XX, def. , is a local weak equivalence in the sense of def. .


Proof
The nn-stalk of the smooth manifold XX regarded as a presheaf is the set of equivalence classes of maps from open pointed nn-disks into it, where two such are identified if they coincide on some small joint sub-disk of their domain. We may call this the set of germs of XX (but beware that this terminology is typically used for something a little bit more restrictive, namely for the case that nn is the dimension of XX and that all maps from the disks into XX are required to be embeddings).
On the other hand the nn-stalk of C({U i})C(\{U_i\}) is the groupoid whose set of objects is the set of germs, in this sense, of the disjoint union ∐iU i\underset{i}{\coprod} U_i, and whose set of morphisms is the set of germs of the disjoint union ∐i,jU i×XU j\underset{i,j}{\coprod} U_i \underset{X}{\times} U_j.
But now since the cover is by open subsets, it follows that for every (x,i,j)∈∐i,jU i×XU j(x,i,j) \in \underset{i,j}{\coprod} U_i \underset{X}{\times} U_j, then every germ of objects [g][g] around (x,i)(x,i) has a representative gg that factors through this double intersection charts: g:D r n→U i×XU j→∐iU ug \colon D^n_r \to U_i \underset{X}{\times} U_j \to \underset{i}{\coprod} U_u. And similarly for (x,j)(x,j).
This means that the groupoid of nn-stalks is a disjoint union of groupoids, one for each germ of XX, all whose components are groupoids in which there is a unique morphism between any two objects, which are copies of this germ regarded as sitting in one of the charts of the cover. This means that each of these connected components is equivalent to the point.
Now the canonical cover projection sends each of these connected components to the germ that it corresponds to. Hence this is a an equivalence of groupoids.

Hypercovers

Definition
A morphism p:Y⟶Xp \colon Y \longrightarrow X of pre-smooth groupoids is called a split hypercover if


YY is


degreewise a coproduct of Cartesian spaces;


such that the degenerate elements split off as a dijoint summand.




pp is a weak equivalence, def. .




Proposition
For XX a smooth manifold and {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} an open cover, then the canonical projection C({U i})→XC(\{U_i\}) \to X from the corresponding Cech groupoid, def. , is a split hypercover precisely if the cover is differentiably good.


Proof
For every cover the map is a weak equivalence, by prop. .
For the Cech groupoid the condition of cofibrancy in def.  means that every non-empty finite intersection of patches is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space, hence to an open ball. This is precisely the definition of differentialbly good open cover.

The (2,1)(2,1)-category of smooth groupoids
The Grpd-enriched category of genuine smooth groupoids is that obtained from that of pre-smooth groupoids, def.  by “universally turning local weak equivalences, def. , into actual homotopy equivalences”. This is stated formally by def.  below, but for many applications in practice certain concrete presentations of what this means concretely are well sufficient, one of these we state below in prop. .

Definition
Write
Smooth1Type≔L lwePreSmooth1Type
  Smooth1Type 
   \coloneqq
  L_{lwe} PreSmooth1Type


for the (2,1)-category which is the simplicial localization of groupoid-valued presheaves at the local weak equivalences, def. .
An object X∈Smooth1TypeX \in Smooth1Type we call a smooth groupoid or smooth homotopy 1-type.


Proposition
Let X,A∈PreSmooth1TypeX,A \in PreSmooth1Type such that AA satisfies descent, def. . Let Y→XY \to X be a split hypercover of XX, def. .
Then there is an equivalence of groupoids
Smooth1Type(X,A)≃PreSmooth1Type(Y,A)
  Smooth1Type(X,A)
  \simeq
  PreSmooth1Type(Y,A)


between the hom-groupoid of smooth groupoids from XX to AA, and that of pre-smooth groupoids, def. , from YY to AA.

Such statements follow with model structures on simplicial presheaves after embedding the present situation in the more general context of smooth infinity-groupoids. See there for more.

Remark
There is a canonical localization functor
PreSmooth1Type⟶L lwePreSmooth1Type=Smooth1Type.
  PreSmooth1Type
  \longrightarrow
  L_{lwe} PreSmooth1Type
  =
  Smooth1Type
  \,.


which is really just the identity as a functor. Instead of doing anything to the objects, passing along this functor just means to change the definition of the hom-groupoids from the direct definition of def.  to the localized definition.
When a pre-smooth groupoid is given by an internal groupoid 𝒢 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet in smooth sets via example , then we indicate its image under this functor by removing the subscript index, writing just 𝒢\mathcal{G}. This reflects the fact that in Smooth1TypeSmooth1Type it no longer makes sense to ask what the space of 0-cells and of 1-cells of an object is, as these are concepts not invariant under local weak equivalence.
In particular this means that we write BG\mathbf{B}G for the image of (BG) •(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet in Smooth1TypeSmooth1Type.


Proposition
Let XX be a smooth manifold, regarded as a smooth 0-groupoid, and let GG be a Lie group, with smooth delooping groupoid BG\mathbf{B}G (example , remark ).
Then
Smooth1Type(X,BG)≃GBund(X)
  Smooth1Type(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  G Bund(X)


is equivalently the groupoid of GG-principal bundles on XX.


Proof
By prop.  the object (BG) •(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet satisfies descent on CartSp. Choose {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} a differentiably good open cover. By prop.  the correspoding Cech groupoid projection C({U i})→XC(\{U_i\}) \to X is a split hypercover, def. . Hence, by prop. , there is an equivalence of groupoids
Smooth1Type(X,BG)≃PreSmooth1Type(C({U i}),(BG) •).
  Smooth1Type(X,\mathbf{B}G)
  \simeq
  PreSmooth1Type(C(\{U_i\}), (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet)
  \,.


The groupoid on the right is, by prop. , the groupoid of Cech 1-cocycles and coboundaries with values in GG relative to a good open cover. This is equivalently the groupoid of GG-principal bundles.


Remark
The content of prop.  is in common jargon that: BG∈SmoothGrpd\mathbf{B}G \in SmoothGrpd is the moduli stack of GG-principal bundles“.

Embedding into smooth ∞\infty-groupoids
By generalizing here groupoids to general Kan complexes and equivalences of groupoids to homotopy equivalences of Kan complexes, one obtains smooth ∞-stacks or smooth ∞-groupoids, which we write
\;\;\; Smooth∞Grpd ≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp)≃L lheFunc(CartSp op,KanCplx)\coloneqq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp) \simeq L_{lhe} Func(CartSp^{op}, KanCplx) .
We often write H≔\mathbf{H} \coloneqq Smooth∞Grpd for short.
By the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma there is a sequence of faithful inclusions
\;\;\; SmoothMfd ↪\hookrightarrow SmoothGrpd ↪\hookrightarrow Smooth∞Grpd.
This induces a corresponding inclusion of simplicial objects and hence of groupoid objects
LieGrpd↪Grpd ∞(SmoothMfd)↪Grpd ∞(Smooth∞Grpd).
  LieGrpd \hookrightarrow Grpd_\infty(SmoothMfd)  \hookrightarrow  Grpd_\infty(Smooth\infty Grpd)
  \,.


For 𝒢 •∈Grpd ∞(H)\mathcal{G}_\bullet \in Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H}) a groupoid object we write
𝒢 0→𝒢≔lim⟶ n𝒢 n
  \mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G} \coloneqq \underset{\longrightarrow}{\lim}_{n} \mathcal{G}_n


for its (∞,1)-colimiting cocone, hence 𝒢∈H\mathcal{G} \in \mathbf{H} (without subscript decoration) denotes the realization of 𝒢 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet as a single object in H\mathbf{H}.
By the Giraud-Rezk-Lurie axioms of the (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} this morphism 𝒢 0→𝒢\mathcal{G}_0 \to \mathcal{G} is a 1-epimorphism – an atlas – and its construction establishes is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories Grpd ∞(H)≃H 1epi Δ 1Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H}) \simeq \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^1}_{1epi}, hence morphisms 𝒢 •→𝒦 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet \to \mathcal{K}_\bullet in Grpd ∞(H)Grpd_\infty(\mathbf{H}) are equivalently diagrams in H\mathbf{H} of the form
𝒢 0 → 𝒦 0 ↓ ⇙ ↓ 𝒢 → 𝒦.
  \array{
    \mathcal{G}_0 &\to& \mathcal{K}_0
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    \mathcal{G} &\to& \mathcal{K}
  }
  \,.


This is evidently more constrained that just morphisms
𝒢→𝒦
  \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{K}
by themselves. The latter are the “generalized” or Morita morphisms between the groupoid objects 𝒢 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet, 𝒦 •\mathcal{K}_\bullet. These can be modeled as 𝒢 •\mathcal{G}_\bullet-𝒦 •\mathcal{K}_\bullet-bibundles.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

Working in the 1-category Set of 0-categories amounts to doing set theory. The point of sheaf toposes is to pass to parameterized 0-categories, namely presheaf categories. Although these topoi behave much like the 1-topos Set, their objects are generalized spaces that may carry more structure. For instance, a (pre)sheaf on Diff is a generalized smooth space.

The idea of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes is to generalize the above situation from 11 to (∞,1)(\infty,1) (recall the notion of (n,r)-category and see the general discussion at ∞-topos):

Working in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd of (∞,0)-categories amounts to doing homotopy theory. The point of (∞,1)-sheaves is to pass to parameterized (∞,0)-categories, namely (∞,1)-presheaf categories. Although these (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi behave much like the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd, their objects are generalized spaces with higher homotopies that may carry more structure. More generally we have topoi of sheaves, and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi of (∞,1)-sheaves. For instance, an ∞-Lie groupoid is an (∞,1)-sheaf on CartSp.

Global sections geometric morphism
Every ∞-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism to the terminal ∞\infty-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd: the direct image is the global sections (∞,1)-functor Γ\Gamma, the inverse image is the constant ∞-stack functor
(LConst⊣Γ):H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConst∞Grpd.
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


In fact, this is unique, up to equivalence: Since every ∞\infty-groupoid is an 


(
∞
,
1
)

(\infty,1)

-colimit (namely over itself, by this Prop.) of the point (hence of the terminal object), and since the inverse image ∞\infty-functor LConstLConst needs to preserve these ∞\infty-colimits (being a left adjoint) as well as the point (being a lex functor).
Closed monoidal structure

Proposition
Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.


Proof
By the fact that every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits it follows that for every object XX the (∞,1)-functor
X×(−):H→H
  X \times (-) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}


preserves all (∞,1)-colimits. Since every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a locally presentable (∞,1)-category it follows with the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem that there is a right adjoint (∞,1)-functor
(X×(−)⊣[X,−]):H→[X,−]←X×(−)H.
  (X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{X \times (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} \mathbf{H}
  \,.



Proposition
For CC an (∞,1)-site for H\mathbf{H} we have that the internal hom (mapping stack) [X,−][X,-] is given on A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} by the (∞,1)-sheaf
[X,A]:U↦H(X×Ly(U),A),
  [X,A] \,\colon\, U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U), A)
  \,,


where y:C→Hy : C \to \mathbf{H} is the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding and L:PSh C→HL : PSh_C \to \mathbf{H} denotes ∞-stackification.


Proof
The argument is entirely analogous to that of the closed monoidal structure on sheaves.
We use the full and faithful geometric embedding (L⊣i):H↪PSh C(L \dashv i) : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow PSh_C and the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma to find for all U∈CU \in C the value
[X,A](U)≃PSh C(yU,[X,A])
  [X,A](U) \simeq PSh_C(y U, [X,A])


and then the fact that ∞-stackification LL is left adjoint to inclusion to get
⋯≃H(Ly(U),[X,A]).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(L y(U), [X,A])
  \,.


Then the defining adjunction (X×(−)⊣[X,−])(X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) gives
⋯≃H(X×Ly(U),A).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U) , A)
  \,.

By definition, for any S∈Grpd ∞S \in Grpd_\infty and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the powering] is the (∞,1)-limit over the diagram constant on XX

while the tensoring is the (∞,1)-colimit over the diagram constant on XX

  \,.




Remark
Under Isbell duality, the powering operations on homotopy types XX corresponds to higher order Hochschild cohomology of suitable algebras of functions on XX, as discussed there.

Slice-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object, the slice-(∞,1)-category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos – an over-(∞,1)-topos. The projection π !:H /X→H\pi_! : \mathbf{H}_{/X} \to \mathbf{H} part of an essential geometric morphism

This is HTT, prop. 6.3.5.1.
The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} could be called the gros topos of XX. A geometric morphism K→H\mathbf{K} \to \mathbf{H} that factors as K→≃H /X→πH\mathbf{K} \xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathbf{H}_{/X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} \mathbf{H} is called an etale geometric morphism.
Syntax in univalent homotopy type theory
(∞,1)(\infty,1)-Toposes provide categorical semantics for homotopy type theory with a univalent Tarskian type of types (which inteprets as the object classifier).

relation between type theory and category theory – Univalent homotopy type theory and infinity-toposes


Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.
(…)
Decidability
(…)
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.

Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

A category consists of a collection of things and binary relationships (or transitions) between them, such that these relationships can be combined and include the “identity” relationship “is the same as.”


A category is a quiver (a directed graph with multiple edges) with a rule saying how to compose two edges that fit together to get a new edge. Furthermore, each vertex has an edge starting and ending at that vertex, which acts as an identity for this composition.


A category is a combinatorial model for a directed space – a “directed homotopy 1-type” in some sense. It has “points”, called objects, and also directed “paths”, or “processes” connecting these points, called morphisms. There is a rule for how to compose paths; and for each object there is an identity path that starts and ends there.


More precisely, a category consists of a collection of objects and a collection of morphisms. Every morphism has a source object and a target object. If ff is a morphism with xx as its source and yy as its target, we write
f:x→yf : x \to y
and we say that ff is a morphism from xx to yy. In a category, we can compose a morphism g:x→yg : x \to y and a morphism f:y→zf : y \to z to get a morphism f∘g:x→zf \circ g : x \to z. Composition is associative and satisfies the left and right unit laws.





A good example to keep in mind is the category Set, in which the objects are sets and a morphism f:x→yf : x \to y is a function from the set xx to the set yy. Here composition is the usual composition of functions.
For more background on and context for categories see

category theory.



A functor is a homomorphism of categories.


A functor between small categories is a homomorphism of the underlying graphs that respects the composition of edges.


So, for CC, DD two categories, a functor F:C→DF \colon C \to D consists of


a component-function of the classes of objects;
F 0:Obj(C)→Obj(D)F_0 \colon Obj(C) \to Obj(D)




a component-function of sets of morphisms
F 1:Mor(C)→Mor(D)F_1 \colon Mor(C) \to Mor(D)
or equivalently:
for each pair x,y∈Obj(C)x,y \in Obj(C) of objects, a component-function
(1)F x,y:C(x,y)→D(F(x),F(y))
  
  F_{x,y} \;\colon\; C(x,y) \xrightarrow{\;\;} D(F(x), F(y))


between hom-sets;


such that:


it respects source and target of morphisms: F 1F_1 coincides with F 0F_0 on source and target objects;


it respects identity morphisms: F(id X)=id F(X)F(id_X) = id_{F(X)};


it respects composition: the image of the composite of two morphisms under FF is the composite of their images.


These last two properties are the decisive ones of a functor; they are called the functoriality conditions. These are a direct generalization of the notion of homomorphism (of monoids, groups, algebras, etc.) to the case that there are more objects. As a slogan:
The notion of functor is a horizontal categorification of that of homomorphism.
External definition
A functor FF from a category CC to a category DD is a map sending each object x∈Cx \in C to an object F(x)∈DF(x) \in D and each morphism f:x→yf : x \to y in CC to morphism F(f):F(x)→F(y)F(f) : F(x) \to F(y) in DD, such that


FF preserves composition: F(g∘f)=F(g)∘F(f)F(g\circ f) = F(g)\circ F(f) whenever the left-hand side is well-defined,


FF preserves identity morphisms: for each object x∈Cx \in C, F(1 x)=1 F(x)F(1_x) = 1_{F(x)}.


Or equivalently, since compositions gf=g∘fg f = g\circ f (commuting triangles) and identities 1 x1_x (commuting loops) are both simple commuting diagrams, we can combine the above conditions to the single statement

FF preserves commuting diagrams.

Given morphisms f:X→Yf \colon X\to Y, g:Y→Zg \colon Y\to Z, and h:X→Zh \colon X\to Z, declaring the triangle commutes amounts to declaring
h=g∘f.h = g\circ f.
In this case, for F:C→DF:C\to D to preserve the commutative triangle means
F(h)=F(g)∘F(f)F(h) = F(g)\circ F(f)
as depicted below

Preserving commuting triangles means FF preserves compositions.
Given morphisms f:X→Yf:X\to Y, g:Y→Zg:Y\to Z, and h:Z→Xh:Z\to X, declaring the loop commutes amounts to declaring
1 X=h∘g∘f.1_X = h\circ g\circ f.
In this case, for F:C→DF:C\to D to preserve the commutative loop means
F(1 X)=F(h)∘F(g)∘F(f)F(1_X) = F(h)\circ F(g)\circ F(f)
as depicted below

However, it means more than that. Since any commutative loop is equal to the identity morphism, we must also have
1 F(X)=F(h)∘F(g)∘F(f)1_{F(X)} = F(h)\circ F(g)\circ F(f)
implying
F(1 X)=1 F(X).F(1_X) = 1_{F(X)}.
Preserving commuting loops means FF preserves identity morphisms.
Another equivalent way to say this is that a functor F:C→DF : C \to D is precisely a morphism of simplicial sets N(F):N(C)→N(D)N(F) : N(C) \to N(D) between the nerves of these categories


the objects of CC and DD are the 0-cells of N(C)N(C) and N(D)N(D), so N(F) 0:N(F) 0→N(F) 0N(F)_0 : N(F)_0 \to N(F)_0 maps objects of CC to objects of DD;


the morphisms of CC and DD are the 1-cells of N(C)N(C) and N(D)N(D), so N(F) 1:N(F) 1→N(F) 1N(F)_1 : N(F)_1 \to N(F)_1 maps morphisms of CC to objects of DD;


the identity morphisms of CC and DD are the degenerate 1-cells of N(C)N(C) and N(D)N(D), so the fact that N(F)N(F) respects degeneracy maps means that FF respects identities;


the commuting triangles of CC and DD are the 2-cells of N(C)N(C) and N(D)N(D), so the fact that N(F)N(F) maps 2-cells to 2-cells means that it respects commuting triangles, hence that it respects composition.


See nerve for more details on this.
The functors between two categories CC and DD form themselves a category, the functor category [C,D][C,D], whose morphisms are natural transformations. Equipped with these functor categories as hom-objects, we have a 22-category Cat of categories, functors and natural transformations. In other words, functors are morphisms in CatCat.
Internal definition
If CC and DD are internal categories in some ambient category AA, then an internal functor F:C→DF : C \to D is


a morphism of objects F 0:C 0→D 0F_0 : C_0 \to D_0 in AA;


a morphisms of morphisms F 1:C 1→D 1F_1 : C_1 \to D_1 in AA;

This reproduces the external definition of functors above for small categories, which are categories internal to Set
In many cases, this notion is too restrictive, and we should use internal anafunctors instead.
Enriched definition
In enriched category theory a functor maps not hom-sets but the given hom-objects to each other, in a way that respects their composition. This is described at

enriched functor.

Profunctors
A generalization of the notion of enriched functor is the notion of profunctor.
Higher categorical functors
In higher category theory there are corresponding higher notions of functor, such as


2-functor


strict 2-functor


pseudofunctor


lax functor




(∞,1)-functor


See also an informal discussion about an experimental alternative definition of functor.


In homotopy type theory
Note: the HoTT book calls a category a “precategory” and a univalent category a “category”, but here we shall refer to the standard terminology of “category” and “univalent category” respectively.
The definition of functor in homotopy type theory is a straightforward translation of the ordinary one. However, the notion of univalent category allows us to construct some such functors that in classical mathematics would require either the axiom of choice or the use of anafunctors.
Let AA and BB be categories. Informally, a functor F:A→BF : A \to B consists of

A function F 0:A 0→B 0F_0 : A_0 \to B_0
For each a,b:Aa,b:A, a function F a,b:hom A(a,b)→hom B(Fa,Fb)F_{a,b}:hom_A(a,b) \to hom_B(F a,F b), generally also denoted FF.
For each a:Aa:A, we have F(1 a)=1 FaF(1_a)=1_{F a}.
For each a,b,c:Aa,b,c: A and f:hom A(a,b)f:hom_A(a,b) and g:hom A(b,c)g:hom_A(b,c), we have

F(g∘f)=Fg∘FfF(g \circ f) = F g \circ F f
Formally, the type of functors from AA to BB is
Func(A,B)≔∑ F 0:A 0→B 0∑ F:∏ a,b:Ahom A(a,b)→hom B(Fa,Fb)(∏ a:AF(1 a)=1 Fa)×(∏ a,b,c:A∏ f:hom A(a,b)∏ g:hom A(b,c)F(g∘f)=Fg∘Ff) Func(A,B) \coloneqq
\sum_{F_0:A_0\to B_0} \sum_{F:\prod_{a,b:A} hom_A(a,b) \to \hom_B(F a,F b)} \Big(\prod_{a:A} F(1_a) = 1_{F a}\Big) \times \Big( \prod_{a,b,c:A} \prod_{f:\hom_A(a,b)} \prod_{g:\hom_A(b,c)} F(g \circ f) = F g \circ F f\Big) 

A formal definition in Coq can be found in Ahrens-Kapulkin-Shulman 13.
These properties come from the HoTT book.
By induction on identity, a functor also preserves idtoisoidtoiso (See category).
Composition of functors
For functors F:A→BF:A\to B and G:B→CG:B \to C, their composite G∘F:A→CG \circ F : A \to C is given by

The composite (G 0∘F 0):A 0→C 0(G_0 \circ F_0): A_0 \to C_0
For each a,b:Aa,b:A, the composite(G Fa,Fb∘F a,b):hom A(a,b)→hom C(GFa,GFb)(G_{F a, F b} \circ F_{a,b}):hom_A(a,b)\to hom_C(G F a, G F b)

Lemma 9.2.9 in HoTT book
Composition of functors is associative H(GF)=(HG)FH(G F)=(H G)F.
Proof: Since composition of functions is associative, this follows immediately for the actions on objects and on homs. And since hom-sets are sets, the rest of the data is automatic. □\square
Lemma 9.2.10 in HoTT book
Lemma 9.2.9 is coherent, i.e. the following pentagon of equalities commutes:
  (KH)(GF)  ↗  ↘ ((KH)G)F    K(H(GF)) ↓    ↑ (K(HG))F  ⟶  K((HG)F)

Classically, a group is a monoid in which every element has an inverse (necessarily unique). When written with a view toward group objects (see Internalization below), one should rather say that a group is a monoid together with an inversion operation.
An abelian group is a group in which moreover the order in which two elements are multiplied is irrelevant.
Over ordinary rings
For RR a commutative ring, an associative unital RR-algebra is equivalently:


a monoid internal to the category 


R
Mod

R Mod

 of RR-modules equipped with the tensor product of modules ⊗\otimes;


a pointed single-object category enriched over (RMod,⊗)(R Mod, \otimes);


a pointed RR-algebroid with a single object;


an RR-module AA equipped with RR-linear maps p:A⊗A⟶Ap \colon A \otimes A \longrightarrow A and i:R→Ai \colon R \to A satisfying associativity and unitality;


a ring AA under RR such that the corresponding map R→AR \to A lands in the center of AA.


If there is no danger for confusion, one often says simply ‘associative algebra’, or even only ‘algebra’.
More generally:


a (merely) associative algebra need not have a unit i:R→Ai \colon R \to A; that is, it is a semigroup instead of a monoid;


an 


R

R

-ring is a monoid object in the category 


R
BiMod

R BiMod

 of RR-bimodules equipped with, crucially, the tensor product of bimodules.


Less generally, a commutative algebra (where associativity and unitality are usually assumed) is a commutative monoid objecy in 


R
Mod

R Mod

.
For a given ring the algebras form a category, Alg, and the commutative algebras a subcategory, CommAlg.
Over semi-rings
Note that everywhere rings can be replaced by semi-rings in the previous paragraph. For example a commutative associative unital ℚ +\mathbb{Q}^{+}-algebra is nothing more than a commutative semi-ring RR with a semi-ring homomorphism ℚ +→R\mathbb{Q}^{+} \rightarrow R.
Over monoids in a monoidal category

Definition
Given a monoidal category (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1), then a monoid internal to (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1) is


an object A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C};


a morphism e:1⟶Ae \;\colon\; 1 \longrightarrow A (called the unit)

Moreover, if (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes , 1) has the structure of a symmetric monoidal category (𝒞,⊗,1,B)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1, B) with symmetric braiding τ\tau, then a monoid (A,μ,e)(A,\mu, e) as above is called a commutative monoid in (𝒞,⊗,1,B)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1, B) if in addition

Write Mon(𝒞,⊗,1)Mon(\mathcal{C}, \otimes,1) for the category of monoids in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, and CMon(𝒞,⊗,1)CMon(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1) for its subcategory of commutative monoids.

For the resulting category of modules of left AA-modules in 𝒞\mathcal{C} with AA-module homomorphisms between them, we write
AMod(𝒞).
  A Mod(\mathcal{C})
  \,.


This is naturally a (pointed) topologically enriched category itself.

Proposition
Given a symmetric monoidal category (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1) (def. ), and given (A,μ,e)(A,\mu,e) a commutative monoid in (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1) (def. ). If all coequalizers exist in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, then the tensor product of modules ⊗ A\otimes_A from def.  makes the category of modules AMod(𝒞)A Mod(\mathcal{C}) into a symmetric monoidal category, (AMod,⊗ A,A)(A Mod, \otimes_A, A) with tensor unit the object AA itself.


Definition
Given a monoidal category of modules (AMod,⊗ A,A)(A Mod , \otimes_A , A) as in prop. , then a monoid (E,μ,e)(E, \mu, e) in (AMod,⊗ A,A)(A Mod , \otimes_A , A) (def. ) is called an AA-algebra.


Proposition
Given a monoidal category of modules (AMod,⊗ A,A)(A Mod , \otimes_A , A) in a monoidal category (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C},\otimes, 1) as in prop. , and an AA-algebra (E,μ,e)(E,\mu,e) (def. ), then there is an equivalence of categories
AAlg comm(𝒞)≔CMon(AMod)≃CMon(𝒞) A/

between the category of commutative monoids in AModA Mod and the coslice category of commutative monoids in 𝒞\mathcal{C} under AA, hence between commutative AA-algebras in 𝒞\mathcal{C} and commutative monoids EE in 𝒞\mathcal{C} that are equipped with a homomorphism of monoids A⟶EA \longrightarrow E.

(e.g. EKMM 97, VII lemma 1.3)

Proof
In one direction, consider a AA-algebra EE with unit e E:A⟶Ee_E \;\colon\; A \longrightarrow E and product μ E/A:E⊗ AE⟶E\mu_{E/A} \colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E. There is the underlying product μ E\mu_E
E⊗A⊗E AAA⟶⟶ E⊗E ⟶coeq E⊗ AE     μ E↘ ↓ μ E/A     E.
  \array{
    E \otimes A \otimes E
    & 
    \underoverset
      {\underset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\overset{}{\longrightarrow}}
      {\phantom{AAA}}
    &
    E \otimes E
     &\overset{coeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    && & {}_{\mathllap{\mu_E}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && && E
  }
  \,.


By considering a diagram of such coequalizer diagrams with middle vertical morphism e E∘e Ae_E\circ e_A, one find that this is a unit for μ E\mu_E and that (E,μ E,e E∘e A)(E, \mu_E, e_E \circ e_A) is a commutative monoid in (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1).
Then consider the two conditions on the unit e E:A⟶Ee_E \colon A \longrightarrow E. First of all this is an AA-module homomorphism, which means that
(⋆)A⊗A ⟶id⊗e E A⊗E  μ A↓  ↓ ρ A ⟶e E E
  (\star)
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes A &\overset{id \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}& A \otimes E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\mu_A}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\rho}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E
  }


commutes. Moreover it satisfies the unit property
A⊗ AE ⟶e A⊗id E⊗ AE   ≃↘ ↓ μ E/A   E.
  \array{
    A \otimes_A E 
      &\overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{\simeq}}\searrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    && E
  }
  \,.


By forgetting the tensor product over AA, the latter gives
A⊗E ⟶e⊗id E⊗E ↓  ↓  A⊗ AE ⟶e E⊗id E⊗ AE  ≃↓  ↓ μ E/A E = E≃A⊗E ⟶e E⊗id E⊗E  ρ↓  ↓ μ E E ⟶id E,
  \array{
    A \otimes E 
      &\overset{e \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{}}
    \\
    A \otimes_A E 
      &\overset{e_E \otimes id}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes_A E
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow 
      && 
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_{E/A}}}
    \\
    E &=& E
  }
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
   \simeq
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \array{
    A \otimes E

    E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E

where the top vertical morphisms on the left the canonical coequalizers, which identifies the vertical composites on the right as shown. Hence this may be pasted to the square (⋆)(\star) above, to yield a commuting square

    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E &\underset{id}{\longrightarrow}& E

   =

    A \otimes A 
     &\overset{e_E \otimes e_E}{\longrightarrow}&
    E \otimes E
    \\

      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mu_E}}
    \\
    A &\underset{e_E}{\longrightarrow}& E

  \,.


This shows that the unit e Ae_A is a homomorphism of monoids (A,μ A,e A)⟶(E,μ E,e E∘e A)(A,\mu_A, e_A) \longrightarrow (E, \mu_E, e_E\circ e_A).
Now for the converse direction, assume that (A,μ A,e A)(A,\mu_A, e_A) and (E,μ E,e′ E)(E, \mu_E, e'_E) are two commutative monoids in (𝒞,⊗,1)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes, 1) with e E:A→Ee_E \;\colon\; A  \to E a monoid homomorphism. Then EE inherits a left AA-module structure by
ρ:A⊗E⟶e A⊗idE⊗E⟶μ EE.
  \rho
    \;\colon\;
  A \otimes E 
    \overset{e_A \otimes id}{\longrightarrow} 
  E \otimes E
    \overset{\mu_E}{\longrightarrow}
  E
  \,.


By commutativity and associativity it follows that μ E\mu_E coequalizes the two induced morphisms E⊗A⊗EAA⟶⟶E⊗EE \otimes A \otimes E \underoverset{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}{\phantom{AA}} E \otimes E. Hence the universal property of the coequalizer gives a factorization through some μ E/A:E⊗ AE⟶E\mu_{E/A}\colon E \otimes_A E \longrightarrow E. This shows that (E,μ E/A,e E)(E, \mu_{E/A}, e_E) is a commutative AA-algebra.
Finally one checks that these two constructions are inverses to each other, up to isomorphism.

In the pattern of (n,r)-categories the notion of (∞,1)-category is special in that it is precisely the structure that


admits homotopy theory in that it encodes the notion of higher coherent equivalence;


admits category theory in terms of universal constructions: limits, adjunctions, Grothendieck constructions, etc.


This entry surveys the category theory of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories .
The theory of (∞,1)-toposes, generalizing topos theory from category theory to (∞,1)-category theory: “geometric homotopy theory”.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being


about logic


about geometry.


Supergeometry is the (higher) geometry over the base topos on superpoints modeled on the canonical line object ℝ\mathbb{R} in there.
As ordinary differential geometry studies spaces – smooth manifolds – that locally look like vector spaces, supergeometry studies spaces – supermanifolds – that locally look like super vector spaces.
As ordinary algebraic geometry studies spaces – schemes – that locally look like affine spaces, supergeometry studies superschemes.
From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, the supergeometry is a very mild special case of noncommutativity in geometry: some coordinates commute, some anticommute.
For more see at geometry of physics – supergeometry.
Supergeometry may defined over an arbitrary commutative ring (Schwarz and Shapiro 06).
A fermion is a particle/quantum field that obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics? (Pauli exclusion principle). By the spin-statistics theorem, this is the same thing as a particle whose spin is half an integer but not itself an integer.
In the standard model of particle physics and the standard model of cosmology fermions are the matter constituents of the observable universe, as opposed to bosons, which are the quanta of force gauge fields.
The formalization of fermions is in supergeometry: fermion fields are sections of spinor bundles with odd-degree fibers in supergeometry. This is exhibited by what is called Fermi-Dirac statistics? and the Pauli exclusion principle.
The field of quantum field theory started out as a description of the fundamental particles that are observed in experiment, such as electrons and photons.
However, even so, abstractly the formalization of the concept of particle within QFTs is somewhat subtle.
If the quantum field theory is on Minkowski space and comes with a Hilbert space of states on which thus the Poincare group of translations, rotations and boosts in Minkowski space acts, the massive particle excitations of the theory can be found in the discrete spectrum of the time translation operator as the irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. For QFTs on curved spacetimes the situation is more subtle.
Often, however, QFTs are considered as quantizations of given Lagrangians. In these cases one often identifies their particle content with that explicitly encoded by the Lagrangian. Notably when that arises from second quantization of some 1-dimensional sigma-model, the particles of the theory are those described by these sigma-models.
In particle physics, matter is a bound state of fermionic particles.
This is in contrast to force fields, whose quanta are bosonic particles.
In the standard model of particle physics, all matter fields are sections of a spinor bundle on spacetime which is associated of a U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)-principal bundle.
In the standard model of cosmology matter is characterized as part of the energy-momentum density with specific parameter of state w=p/ρw = p/\rho, see at FRW model.
On the very largest scales observable in astrophysical experiment, the cosmos is well described by an FRW model with cosmological constant Λ\Lambda (but see at inhomogeneous cosmology), with plenty of dark matter and with primordial cosmic inflation (called the Λ\Lambda-CDM “concordance model of cosmology”). A horizon in there and everything on smaller scales is the observable universe.
There has never been a reason to assume that beyond this cosmic horizon visible to us today, the cosmos would not extend further. In fact in the simple FRW models with positive cosmological constant, the spacetime manifold is not a closed manifold and extends indefinitely beyond our observable horizon. This is directly analogous to the ancient mariner who would stand on the deck of his ship and see a few miles of ocean around him. That was the world within his horizon, but there was no telling what lay beyond.
Therefore it is important to distinguish the observable universe from the universe as such. Unfortunately, intellectual laziness tended to ignore this distinction and at some point some people who said “universe” to mean just the stretch of our cosmic horizon felt the need to have a new term for whatever may lie beyond. For better or worse, that new term has become wide-spread these days and is “multiverse”.
The main scientific observation that goes with this is the observation that cosmic inflation – for which there is by now excellent and ever increasing experimental evidence that indeed it happened – does, at least by the simple method which is currently used to model it, naturally predict a large ambient space in which local regions stochastically undergo inflationary expansion. This scenario of chaotic inflation has in fact been singled out as the most likely one (within the standard model) by the bicep2-experiment in 2014.
In any case, as far as the observable universe is concerned, two facts are worth noticing:


the observable universe alone is already pretty darn large, see the various discussion of its scales below;


Giordano Bruno‘s old intuition remains plausible even at the largest scales: possibly the full xyz-verse beyond our present horizon is vastly larger still… and we may never know.

Recent measurements (c. 2001) by a number of ground-based and balloon-based experiments, including MAT/TOCO, Boomerang, Maxima, and DASI, have shown that the brightest spots are about 1 degree across. Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know that the universe is flat with only a 2% margin of error

A logical framework is a formal metalanguage for deductive systems, such as logic, natural deduction, type theories, sequent calculus, etc. Of course, like any formal system, these systems can be described in any sufficiently strong metalanguage. However, all logical systems of this type share certain distinguishing features, so it is helpful to have a particular metalanguage which is well-adapted to describing systems with those features.
Much of the description below is taken from (Harper).
One of the most important observations of category theory is that large parts of mathematics can be internalized in any category with sufficient structure. The most basic examples of this involve algebraic structures; for instance, a group can be defined in any category with finite products, and an internal strict category can be defined in any ambient category with pullbacks. For such algebraic (or even essentially algebraic) structures, which are defined by operations with equational axioms imposed, it suffices for the ambient category to have (usually finite) limits.
However, if we assume that the ambient category has additional structure, then much more of mathematics can be internalized, potentially including fields, local rings, finite sets, topological spaces, even the field of real numbers. The idea is to exploit the fact that all mathematics can be written in the language of logic, and seek a way to internalize logic in a category with sufficient structure.
The basic ideas of the internal logic induced by a given category CC are:


the objects AA of CC are regarded as collections of things of a given type AA


the morphisms A→BA\to B of CC are regarded as terms of type BB containing a free variable of type AA (i.e. in a context x:Ax:A)


a subobject ϕ↪A\phi \hookrightarrow A is regarded as a proposition (predicate): by thinking of it as the sub-collection of all those things of type AA for which the statement ϕ\phi is true


the maximal subobject is hence the proposition that is always true; this is the logical object of truth ⊤↪A\top \hookrightarrow A


the minimal subobject is hence the proposition that is always false; this is the logical object of falsity ⊥↪A\bottom \hookrightarrow A


one proposition implies another if as subobjects of AA they are connected by a morphism in the poset of subobjects: ϕ⇒ψ\phi \Rightarrow \psi means ϕ↪ψ\phi \hookrightarrow \psi




Logical operations are implemented by universal constructions on subobjects.


the conjunction and is the product of subobjects (their meet)


the conjunction or is the coproduct of subobjects (their join)




and so on.

A dependent type over an object AA of CC may be interpreted as a morphism B→AB\to A whose “fibers” represent the types B(x)B(x) for x:Ax:A. This morphism might be restricted to be a display map or a fibration.

Once we formalize the notion of “logical theory”, the construction of the internal logic can be interpreted as a functor LangLang from suitably structured categories to theories. The morphisms of theories are “interpretations”, and so an internalization of some theory TT (such as the “theory of groups”) into a category CC is a morphism of theories T→Lang(C)T\to Lang(C).
Moreover, the functor LangLang has a left adjoint functor: the syntactic category SynSyn of a theory. Thus, a model of TT in CC is equally well a functor Syn(T)→CSyn(T)\to C. Frequently, this adjunction is even an equivalence of categories; see relation between type theory and category theory.
Kinds of internal logics in different categories
There are many different kinds of of “logical theories”, each of which corresponds to a type of category in which such theories can be internalized (and yields a corresponding adjunction Syn⊣LangSyn \dashv Lang).

Each type of logic up to and including “geometric” can also be described in terms of sketches. Not coincidentally, the corresponding types of category up to and including “geometric” fit into the framework of familial regularity and exactness. Sketches can also describe theories applicable to categories not even having finite products, such as finite sum sketches, but the type-theoretic approach taken on this page requires at least finite products (or else something closely akin, such as a cartesian multicategory).
However, there are other sorts of internalization that do not fit in this framework. For instance, to describe a monoid internal to a monoidal category, one needs an internal linear logic. See internalization for a discussion of the more general notion in the context of doctrines.
There are various different perspectives on the notion of topos. One is that a topos is a category that looks like a category of spaces that sit by local homeomorphisms over a given base space: all spaces that are locally modeled on a given base space.
The archetypical class of examples are sheaf toposes Sh(X)=Et(X)Sh(X) = Et(X) over a topological space XX: these are the categories of étale spaces over XX, topological spaces YY that are equipped with a local homeomorphisms Y→XY \to X.
When X=*X = * is the point, this is just the category Set of all sets: spaces that are modeled on the point. This is the archetypical topos itself.
What makes the notion of topos powerful is the following fact: even though the general topos contains objects that are considerably different from and possibly considerably richer than plain sets and even richer than étale spaces over a topological space, the general abstract category theoretic properties of every topos are essentially the same as those of Set. For instance in every topos all small limits and colimits exist and it is cartesian closed (even locally). This means that a large number of constructions in Set have immediate analogs internal to every topos, and the analogs of the statements about these constructions that are true in SetSet are true in every topos.
On the one hand this may be thought of as saying that toposes are very nice categories of spaces in that whatever construction on spaces one thinks of – for instance formation of quotients or of fiber products or of mapping spaces – the resulting space with the expected general abstract properties will exist in the topos. In this sense toposes are convenient categories for geometry – as in: convenient category of topological spaces, but even more convenient than that.
On the other hand, by de-emphasizing the geometric interpretation of their objects and just using their good abstract properties, this means that toposes are contexts with a powerful internal logic. The internal logic of toposes is intuitionistic higher order logic. This means that, while the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice may fail, apart from that, every logical statement not depending on these does hold internal to every topos.
For this reason toposes are often studied as abstract contexts “in which one can do mathematics”, independently of their interpretation as categories of spaces. These two points of views on toposes, as being about geometry and about logic at the same time, is part of the richness of topos theory.
On a third hand, however, we can de-emphasize the role of the objects of the topos and instead treat the topos itself as a “generalized space” (and in particular, a categorified space). We then consider the topos Sh(X)Sh(X) as a representative of XX itself, while toposes not of this form are “honestly generalized” spaces. This point of view is supported by the fact that the assignment X↦Sh(X)X\mapsto Sh(X) is a full embedding of (sufficiently nice) topological spaces into toposes, and that many topological properties of a space XX can be detected at the level of Sh(X)Sh(X). (This is even more true once we pass to (∞,1)-toposes.)
From this point of view, the objects of a topos (regarded as a category) should be thought of instead as sheaves on that topos (regarded as a generalized space). And just as sheaves on a topological space can be identified with local homeomorphisms over it, such “sheaves on a topos” (i.e. objects of the topos qua category) can be identified with other toposes that sit over the given topos via a local homeomorphism of toposes.
Finally, mixing this point of view with the second one, we can regard toposes over a given topos EE instead as “toposes in the EE-world of mathematics.” For this reason, the theory of toposes over a given base is formally quite similar to that of arbitrary toposes. And coming full circle, this fact allows the use of “base change arguments” as a very useful technical tool, even if our interest is only in one or two particular toposes qua categories.
‘What a topos is like:’
(i) ‘A topos is a category of sheaves on a site’
(ii) ‘A topos is a category with finite limits and power-objects’
(iii) ‘A topos is (the embodiment of) an intuitionistic higher-order theory’
(iv) ‘A topos is (the extensional essence of) a first-order (infinitary) geometric theory’
(v) ‘A topos is a totally cocomplete object in the meta-2-category CART of cartesian (i.e. , finitely complete) categories’
(vi) ‘A topos is a generalized space’
(vii) ‘A topos is a semantics for intuitionistic formal systems’
(viii) ‘A topos is a Morita equivalence class of continuous groupoids’
(ix) ‘A topos is the category of maps of a power allegory’
(x) ‘A topos is a category whose canonical indexing over itself is complete and well-powered’
(xi) ‘A topos is the spatial manifestation of a giraud frame’
(xii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic differential geometry’
(xiii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic domain theory’,
And so on. But the important thing about the elephant is that ‘however you approach it, it is still the same animal’. Elephant
Extensivity
Every topos is an extensive category. For Grothendieck toposes, infinitary extensivity is part of the characterizing Giraud's theorem. For elementary toposes, see toposes are extensive.
Adhesiveness
Every topos is an adhesive category. For Grothendieck toposes this follows immediately from the adhesion of Set, for elementary toposes it is due to (Lack-Sobocinski).
Epimorphisms
In a topos epimorphisms are stable under pullback and hence the (epi, mono) factorization system in a topos is a stable factorization system.
Relation to abelian categories
While crucially different from abelian categories, there is some intimate relation between toposes and abelian categories. For more on that see AT category.
Reasoning in a topos
Any result in ordinary mathematics whose proof is finitist and constructive automatically holds in any topos. If you remove the restriction that the proof be finitist, then the result holds in any topos with a natural numbers object; if you remove the restrictions that the proof be constructive, then the result holds in any boolean topos. On the other hand, if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in the weaker sense used by constructivists, then the result may fail in some toposes but holds in any Π\Pi-pretopos; if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in a stronger sense, then the result holds in any Heyting pretopos.
Therefore, one can prove results in toposes and similar categories by reasoning, not about the objects and morphisms in the topos themselves, but instead about sets and functions in the normal language of structural set theory, which is more familiar to most mathematicians. One merely has to be careful about what axioms one uses to get results of sufficient generality.
The internal language of a topos is called Mitchell-Bénabou language.
Specific examples and key results


The archetypical topos is Set. Notice that this happens to be a Grothendieck topos: it is the category of sheaves on the point.
The full subcategory FinSet is also an elementary topos, and the inclusion functor FinSet↪SetFinSet \hookrightarrow Set is a logical morphism. This is not a Grothendieck topos.
More generally, for κ\kappa a strong limit cardinal the full subcategory Set κSet_\kappa of sets or cardinality less than κ\kappa is a topos.


For CC any (small) site, the category of sheaves Sh(C)Sh(C) is a Grothendieck topos. Either by definition or by Giraud's theorem, every Grothendieck topos arises in this way. Important examples include:


The case where the Grothendieck topology is the trivial one, so that also all categories of presheaves (on small categories) are (Grothendieck) toposes.


The case of sheaves on (the site given by the category of open subsets of) a topological space, or more generally a locale.


The category GSetG Set of sets equipped with the action of a group GG: this is the topos of presheaves on the category BG\mathbf{B}G which is the delooping groupoid of GG.




Continuing the last example above, if GG is a topological group, the category GSetG Set of sets with a continuous action of G (that is, the action map G×X→XG\times X\to X is continuous, where XX has the discrete topology) is a topos, and in fact a Grothendieck topos (though this may not be obvious).


More generally, GG may be a topological groupoid, or even a localic groupoid. In fact, it is a theorem that every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the topos of “continuous sheaves” on a localic groupoid.


Again if GG is a topological group, the category Unif(G)Unif(G) of uniformly continuous GG-sets is also a topos, but not (in general) one of Grothendieck’s. For example, if GG is the profinite completion of ℤ\mathbb{Z}, then a continuous GG-set is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set all of whose orbits are finite, while a uniformly continuous one is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set with a finite upper bound on the size of all its orbits.


For EE a topos and X∈EX \in E any object, also the overcategory or slice category E/XE/X is again a topos. (Elephant, A.2.3.2). See also over-topos.


If EE is a topos and j:E→Ej \colon E \to E is a lex idempotent monad, the category of jj-algebras is a topos. Each such jj corresponds to a Lawvere-Tierney topology in EE, and the category of jj-algebras is equivalent to the category of sheaves for this topology. An example is the double-negation topology.


An obvious example of an elementary topos that is not a Grothendieck topos is the category FinSet of finite sets. More generally, for any strong limit cardinal κ\kappa, the category of sets of cardinality <κ\lt\kappa is an elementary topos, and as long as κ>ω\kappa \gt\omega it has a NNO. Set <κSet_{\lt \kappa} doesn’t even admit a geometric morphism to SetSet.


Since the definition of elementary topos is “algebraic,” there exist free toposes generated by various kinds of data. The category of toposes (and logical functors) is 2-monadic over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms. It has an initial object which is sometimes called the free topos. More generally, any higher-order type theory (of the sort which can be interpreted in the internal logic of a topos) generates a free topos containing a model of that theory. Such toposes (for a consistent theory) are never Grothendieck’s.


If GG is a large groupoid with a small set of objects, then the category [G,Set][G,Set] (which makes sense if we define “large” and “small” relative to a Grothendieck universe) is a topos, but not in general a Grothendieck topos. Note that this topos is in fact complete and cocomplete, but it does not have a small generating set, and so is an unbounded topos.


If ℱ\mathcal{F} is a filter of subterminal objects in any topos EE, then there is a filterquotient? topos E//ℱE//\mathcal{F}. Grothendieck-ness (and completeness and cocompleteness) are not in general preserved by this construction.


If CC and DD are toposes and F:C→DF\colon C\to D is a lex functor, then there is a topos Gl(F)Gl(F) called the Artin gluing of CC and DD along FF, and defined to be the comma category (D/F)(D/F). If CC and DD are Grothendieck toposes then Gl(F)Gl(F) is a SetSet-topos. If FF is accessible, then Gl(F)Gl(F) is again Grothendieck (hence bounded), but in general it may not be. (Note, though, that it is not clear whether it can be proven in ZFC that there exist any inaccessible lex functors between Grothendieck toposes, although from a proper class of measurable cardinals one can construct an inaccessible lex endofunctor of SetSet.)


The category of coalgebras for any lex comonad on a topos is again a topos: a topos of coalgebras, and if the comonad is accessible, this construction preserves Grothendieck-ness. If the comonad is not accessible, then this topos is unbounded.
For instance the Artin gluing Gl(F)Gl(F) is equivalent to the category of coalgebras for the comonad on the topos C×DC\times D defined by (c,d)↦(c,d×F(c))(c,d) \mapsto (c, d\times F(c)).


More generally, the category of coalgebras for any pullback-preserving comonad on a topos is again a topos. This covers both the preceding result and also the overcategory (slice category) result above, since E/XE/X is the category of coalgebras for the pullback-preserving comonad given by X×−:E→EX \times - \colon E \to E. It also covers Artin gluing along a pullback-preserving functor.


More generally still, Todd Trimble has a notion called a “modal operator” on a topos, from which one can construct a new topos of “GG-structures”: see Three topos theorems in one. Special cases include the pullback-preserving comonad result just mentioned, and the result that the category of algebras for a lex idempotent monad is a topos. A related idea is Toby Kenney’s notion of lex distributive diad?, from which one can also construct a topos.


From any partial combinatory algebra one can construct a realizability topos, whose internal logic is “computable” or “effective” mathematics relative to that PCA. In particular, for Kleene's first algebra, one obtains the effective topos, the most-studied of realizability toposes. Realizability toposes are generally not Grothendieck toposes.


A topos can also be constructed from any tripos. This includes realizability toposes as well as toposes of sheaves on locales.


Classes of examples
For various applications one uses toposes that have extra structure or properties.


In the foundations of mathematics, one often studies well-pointed toposes, especially models of ETCS as potential replacements for the category Set.


In synthetic differential geometry one studies smooth toposes as a context for axiomatic differential geometry.


The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}

Dependent type theory is the flavor of type theory that admits dependent types.
Its categorical semantics is in locally cartesian closed categories CC, where a dependent type
x:X⊢E(x)type
  x : X \vdash E(x) \; \mathrm{type}


is interpreted as a morphism E→XE \to X, hence an object in the slice category C /XC_{/X}.
Then change of context corresponds to base change in CC. See also dependent sum and dependent product.
Dependent type systems are heavily used for software certification.
They also seem to support a foundations of mathematics in terms of homotopy type theory.

This (Seely, theorem 6.3). It is somewhat more complicated than this, because we need to strictify the category theory to match the category theory; see categorical model of dependent types. For a more detailed discussion see at relation between type theory and category theory.
Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

Working in the 1-category Set of 0-categories amounts to doing set theory. The point of sheaf toposes is to pass to parameterized 0-categories, namely presheaf categories. Although these topoi behave much like the 1-topos Set, their objects are generalized spaces that may carry more structure. For instance, a (pre)sheaf on Diff is a generalized smooth space.

The idea of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes is to generalize the above situation from 11 to (∞,1)(\infty,1) (recall the notion of (n,r)-category and see the general discussion at ∞-topos):

Working in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd of (∞,0)-categories amounts to doing homotopy theory. The point of (∞,1)-sheaves is to pass to parameterized (∞,0)-categories, namely (∞,1)-presheaf categories. Although these (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi behave much like the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd, their objects are generalized spaces with higher homotopies that may carry more structure. More generally we have topoi of sheaves, and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi of (∞,1)-sheaves. For instance, an ∞-Lie groupoid is an (∞,1)-sheaf on CartSp.

Global sections geometric morphism
Every ∞-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism to the terminal ∞\infty-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd: the direct image is the global sections (∞,1)-functor Γ\Gamma, the inverse image is the constant ∞-stack functor
(LConst⊣Γ):H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConst∞Grpd.
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma)

  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;}

  \,.


In fact, this is unique, up to equivalence: Since every ∞\infty-groupoid is an

(\infty,1)

-colimit (namely over itself, by this Prop.) of the point (hence of the terminal object), and since the inverse image ∞\infty-functor LConstLConst needs to preserve these ∞\infty-colimits (being a left adjoint) as well as the point (being a lex functor).
Closed monoidal structure

Proposition
Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.


Proof
By the fact that every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits it follows that for every object XX the (∞,1)-functor
X×(−):H→H
  X \times (-) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}


preserves all (∞,1)-colimits. Since every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a locally presentable (∞,1)-category it follows with the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem that there is a right adjoint (∞,1)-functor
(X×(−)⊣[X,−]):H→[X,−]←X×(−)H.
  (X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{X \times (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} \mathbf{H}
  \,.



Proposition
For CC an (∞,1)-site for H\mathbf{H} we have that the internal hom (mapping stack) [X,−][X,-] is given on A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} by the (∞,1)-sheaf
[X,A]:U↦H(X×Ly(U),A),
  [X,A] \,\colon\, U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U), A)
  \,,


where y:C→Hy : C \to \mathbf{H} is the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding and L:PSh C→HL : PSh_C \to \mathbf{H} denotes ∞-stackification.


Proof
The argument is entirely analogous to that of the closed monoidal structure on sheaves.
We use the full and faithful geometric embedding (L⊣i):H↪PSh C(L \dashv i) : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow PSh_C and the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma to find for all U∈CU \in C the value
[X,A](U)≃PSh C(yU,[X,A])
  [X,A](U) \simeq PSh_C(y U, [X,A])


and then the fact that ∞-stackification LL is left adjoint to inclusion to get
⋯≃H(Ly(U),[X,A]).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(L y(U), [X,A])
  \,.


Then the defining adjunction (X×(−)⊣[X,−])(X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) gives
⋯≃H(X×Ly(U),A).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U) , A)
  \,.



Powering of ∞\infty-toposes over ∞\infty-groupoids
We discuss how the powering of

-toposes over 


Grpd ∞

Grpd_\infty

 is given by forming mapping stacks out of locally constant 


∞

-stacks. All of the following formulas and their proogfs hold verbatim also for Grothendieck toposes, as they just use general abstract properties.

Let H\mathbf{H} be an

where the inverse image constructs locally constant

and with its internal hom (mapping stack) adjunction denoted

for X∈HX \,\in\, \mathbf{H}.

  \,.


By definition, for any S∈Grpd ∞S \in Grpd_\infty and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the powering] is the (∞,1)-limit over the diagram constant on XX
X K=lim ← KX
  X^K \,=\, {\lim_\leftarrow}_K X


while the tensoring is the (∞,1)-colimit over the diagram constant on XX
K⋅X=lim → KX.
  K \cdot X \,=\, {\lim_{\to}}_K X
  \,.




Remark
Under Isbell duality, the powering operations on homotopy types XX corresponds to higher order Hochschild cohomology of suitable algebras of functions on XX, as discussed there.




Proposition
The powering of H\mathbf{H} over

 is given by the mapping stack out of the locally constant

-stacks:
Grpd ∞ op×H ⟶LConst op×id H op×H ⟶Maps(−,−) H

    \times 
    \mathbf{H}
    &
    \overset{Maps(-,-)}{\longrightarrow}
    &

  }


in that this operation has the following properties:


For all X,A∈HX,\,A \,\in\, \mathbf{H} and S∈Grpd ∞S \,\in\, Grpd_\infty we have a natural equivalence
H(X,Maps(LConst(S),A))≃Grpd ∞(S,H(X,A))

In its first argument the operation


sends the terminal object (the point) to the identity:

For the first statement to be proven, consider the following sequence of natural equivalences:

For the second statement, recall that hom-functors preserve limits in that there are natural equivalences of the form

and that ∞\infty-toposes have universal colimits, in particular that the product operation is a left adjoint (2) and hence preserves colimits:
(6)(−)×lim⟶S •≃lim⟶((−)×S •).

With this, we get the following sequences of natural equivalences:

Slice-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object, the slice-(∞,1)-category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos – an over-(∞,1)-topos. The projection π !:H /X→H\pi_! : \mathbf{H}_{/X} \to \mathbf{H} part of an essential geometric morphism
π:H /X→π *←π *→π !H.
  \pi : \mathbf{H}_{/X} 
  \stackrel{\overset{\pi_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\pi_*}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


This is HTT, prop. 6.3.5.1.
The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} could be called the gros topos of XX. A geometric morphism K→H\mathbf{K} \to \mathbf{H} that factors as K→≃H /X→πH\mathbf{K} \xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathbf{H}_{/X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} \mathbf{H} is called an etale geometric morphism.
Syntax in univalent homotopy type theory
(∞,1)(\infty,1)-Toposes provide categorical semantics for homotopy type theory with a univalent Tarskian type of types (which inteprets as the object classifier).
For more on this see at


model of type theory in an (infinity,1)-topos


relation between type theory and category theory – Univalent homotopy type theory and infinity-toposes


A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}
  \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.

Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

The theory of (∞,1)-toposes, generalizing topos theory from category theory to (∞,1)-category theory: “geometric homotopy theory”.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being


about logic


about geometry.


One may interpret mathematical logic as being a formal language for talking about the collection of monomorphisms into a given object of a given category: the poset of subobjects of that object.
More generally, one may interpret type theory and notably dependent type theory as being a formal language for talking about slice categories, consisting of all morphisms into a given object.
Conversely, starting with a given theory of logic or a given type theory, we say that it has a categorical semantics if there is a category such that the given theory is that of its slice categories, if it is the internal logic of that category.
For the general idea, for the moment see at type theory the section An introduction for category theorists and see at relation between type theory and category theory.
Of dependent type theory
We discuss how to interpret judgements of dependent type theory in a given category 𝒞\mathcal{C} with finite limits. For more see categorical model of dependent types.
Write cod:𝒞 I→𝒞cod : \mathcal{C}^I \to \mathcal{C} for its codomain fibration, and write
χ:𝒞 op→Cat
  \chi : \mathcal{C}^{op} \to Cat


for the corresponding classifying functor, the self-indexing
χ:Γ↦𝒞 /Γ
  \chi : \Gamma \mapsto \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma}


that sends an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} to the slice category over it, and sends a morphism f:Γ→Γ′f : \Gamma \to \Gamma' to the pullback/base change functor
f *:𝒞 /Γ′→𝒞 /Γ.
  f^\ast : \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma'} 
  \to 
  \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma}
  \,.


We give now rules for choices “[xyz][x y z]” that associate with every string “xyzx y z” of symbols in type theory objects and morphisms in 𝒞\mathcal{C}. A collection of such choices following these rules is an interpretation / a choice of categorical semantics of the type theory in the category 𝒞\mathcal{C}.
Contexts and type judgements


The empty context ()() in type theory is interpreted as the terminal object of 𝒞\mathcal{C}
[()]:=*.
  [ () ] := *
  \,.



If Γ\Gamma is a context which has already been given an interpretation [Γ]∈Obj(𝒞)[\Gamma] \in Obj(\mathcal{C}), then a judgement of the form
Γ⊢A:Type
  \Gamma \vdash A : Type


is interpreted as an object in the slice over [Γ][\Gamma]
[Γ⊢A:Type]∈Obj(𝒞 /Γ),
  [\Gamma \vdash A : Type] \in Obj(\mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma})
  \,,


hence as a choice of morphism
[(Γ,x:A)] ↓ [Γ⊢A:Type] [Γ]   
  \array{
    [(\Gamma, x : A)]
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    [\Gamma]
  }


in 𝒞\mathcal{C}.


If a judgement of the form Γ⊢A:Type\Gamma \vdash A : Type has already found an interpretation, as above, then an extended context of the form (Γ,x:A)(\Gamma, x : A) is interpreted as the domain object [(Γ,x:A)][(\Gamma, x : A)] of the above choice of morphism.


Terms
Assume for a context Γ\Gamma and a judgement Γ⊢A:Type\Gamma \vdash A : Type we have already chosen an interpretation [Γ,x:A]→[Γ⊢A:Type][Γ][\Gamma, x : A] \stackrel{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}{\to} [\Gamma] as above.
A judgement of the form Γ⊢a:A\Gamma \vdash a : A (a term of type AA) is to be interpreted as a section of this morphism, equivalently as a morphism in 𝒞 /[Γ]\mathcal{C}_{/[\Gamma]}
[Γ⊢a:A]:*→[Γ,x:A]   
  [\Gamma \vdash a : A] : * \to [\Gamma, x : A]


from the terminal object to [Γ⊢A:Type][\Gamma \vdash A : Type], which in 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a commuting triangle
[Γ]  →[(Γ⊢a:A)]  [Γ,x:A]   id [Γ]↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ].
  \array{
    [\Gamma] &&\stackrel{[(\Gamma \vdash a : A)]}{\to}&&
    [\Gamma, x : A]

    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    && [\Gamma]
  }
  \,.


Variables
For a term Γ⊢a:A\Gamma \vdash  a : A the context Γ\Gamma is the collection of free variables in aa.

Substitution
Assume that interpretations for judgements
Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type
  \Gamma , x : A \vdash B(x) : Type


and
Γ⊢a:A
  \Gamma \vdash  a : A


have been given as above. Then the substitution judgement
Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type
  \Gamma  \vdash B[a/x] : Type


is to be interpreted as follows. The interpretation of the first two terms corresponds to a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C} of the form
    [(Γ,x:A,y:B(x))]     ↓ [Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type] [Γ]  →[Γ⊢a:A]  [(Γ,x:A)]   id↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ]
  \array{
    &&&& [(\Gamma, x : A, y : B(x))]
    \\
    &&&&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]}}
    \\
    [\Gamma] &&\stackrel{[\Gamma \vdash a : A]}{\to}&&
     [(\Gamma, x : A)]
    \\
    & {}_{id}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    && [\Gamma]
  }


The interpretation of the substitution statement is then the pullback
[Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type]:=[Γ⊢a:A] *[Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type],
  [\Gamma \vdash B[a/x] : Type]
  :=
  [\Gamma \vdash a : A]^* [\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]
  \,,


hence the morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} that universally completes the above diagram as
[(Γ,y:B[x/a])]  →  [(Γ,x:A,y:B(x))]  [Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type]↓    ↓ [Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type] [Γ]  →[Γ⊢a:A]  [(Γ,x:A)]   id↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ]

Of homotopy type theory
See categorical semantics of homotopy type theory.
Mathematical physics is a discipline at the interface of mathematics and physics, concerned with developing mathematical theories and models of physical phenomena and mathematical apparatus arising or needed in such models.
Mathematical physics intersects with theoretical physics which deals with theoretical arguments in consideration of physical phenomena and the development of models of known and of conjectured physics. Theoretical physics is commonly more widely conceived as it deals also with interpretations, non-rigorous and sometimes speculative argument from experiments or from rough comparisons of different models and various experimental data, not necessarily being mathematically satisfactoy.
For example, the calculations of fitting parameters and adjusting models to complicated experimental data, called phenomenology is part of the work of a theoretical physicist, but most such work is not nowadays considered to belong to mathematical physics, unless one is developing a really new mathematical model or tool for such work.
On the other hand, ever since Galilei 1623 (∼\sim “The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.”), Hilbert 1930 (“The instrument that mediates between theory and practice, between thought and observation, is mathematics.”) and Wigner 1959 (“unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences”) it may be understood that ultimately, when the dust has settled, all physics is mathematical physics (cf. theory of everything).
Historically, there has been some variance as to what exactly is comprised by “mathematical physics”, see (Fadeev 00) for some history.
In the beginning of the 20th century the term was understood very broadly:

Not only Henri Poincaré, but also Albert Einstein, were called mathematical physicists. Newly established theoretical chairs were called chairs of mathematical physics. It follows from the documents in the archives of the Nobel Committee that MP had a right to appear both in the nominations and discussion of the candidates for the Nobel Prize in physics. Roughly speaking, the concept of Mathematical Physics covered theoretical papers where mathematical formulae were used. (Fadeev 00, p. 1)

Also, in the list of Hilbert's problems of mathematics, the sixth problem regards the mathematical formulation of physics as one of the core problems in mathematics:

6. Mathematical Treatment of the Axioms of Physics. The investigations on the foundations of geometry suggest the problem: To treat in the same manner, by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which already today mathematics plays an important part; in the first rank are the theory of probabilities and mechanics.

However, the 1920 and 1930s the term “mathematical physics” began to be reserved more exclusively for the activity of making precise arguments that are already more or less understood by theoretical physicists informally. The term began to be referred to mathematical tools used in physics or yet more specifically in classical physics as the theory of partial differential equations and variational calculus and in quantum physics as functional analysis and representation theory.

One sees the quest for the rigorous mathematical theorems about results which are understood by physicists in their own way. (Fadeev 00, p. 2)

More recently this narrow understanding has been called into question: Fadeev 00, p. 3 writes:

I consider as the main goal of Mathematical Physics the use of mathematical intuition for the derivation of really new results in the fundamental physics. In this sense, Mathematical Physics and Theoretical Physics are competitors. Their goals in unraveling the laws of the structure of matter coincide. However, the methods and even the estimates of the importance of the results of work may differ quite significally.

In a similar spirit of trying to break out of an overly restrictive understanding of the term “mathematical physics” Gregory Moore has been advocating the alternative term physical mathematics for the study of mathematical constructions inspired by models of theoretical physics (Moore 14).
Some of the greatest names of mathematical physics have sought a more profound role for it in the belief that very deep mathematical ideas are required to describe nature. For instance, Paul Dirac expresses such a view here:

It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. (Paul Dirac, The Evolution of the Physicist’s Picture of Nature, Scientific American 1963)

This view led Dirac to advocate the following as a methodology:

The trend of mathematics and physics towards unification provides the physicist with a powerful new method of research into the foundations of his subject, a method which has not yet been applied successfully, but which I feel confident will prove its value in the future. The method is to begin by choosing that branch of mathematics which one thinks will form the basis of the new theory. One should be influenced very much in this choice by considerations of mathematical beauty. It would probably be a good thing also to give a preference to those branches of mathematics that have an interesting group of transformations underlying them, since transformations play an important role in modern physical theory, both relativity and quantum theory seeming to show that transformations are of more fundamental importance than equations. Having decided on the branch of mathematics, one should proceed to develop it along suitable lines, at the same time looking for that way in which it appears to lend itself naturally to physical interpretation. (The Relation between Mathematics and Physics)

Hermann Weyl helped develop many of the ingredients of modern mathematical physics, as Michael Atiyah explains:

The past 25 years have seen the rise of gauge theories–Kaluza-Klein models of high dimensions, string theories, and now M-theory, as physicists grapple with the challenge of combining all the basic forces of nature into one all embracing theory. This requires sophisticated mathematics involving Lie groups, manifolds, differential operators, all of which are part of Weyl’s inheritance. There is no doubt that he would have been an enthusiastic supporter and admirer of this fusion of mathematics and physics. No other mathematician could claim to have initiated more of the theories that are now being explored. His vision has stood the test of time. (Michael Atiyah, Hermann Weyl: 1885-1955)


[Weyls] contemporaries are long since gone and only a few personal reminiscences survive. On the other hand the passage of time makes it easier to assess the long-term significance of Weyl’s work, to see how his ideas have influenced his successors and helped to shape mathematics and physics in the second half of the twentieth century. In fact, the last fifty years have seen a remarkable blossoming of just those areas that Weyl initiated. In retrospect one might almost say that he defined the agenda and provided the proper framework for what followed. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, and he also took a serious interest in theoretical physics. (Michael Atiyah, Hermann Weyl: 1885-1955)

The version of this belief in the necessity of deep mathematics for physics to be found at the nnLab is, naturally enough, that higher categories, and in particular cohesive (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes, are required. In this regard, see higher category theory and physics, geometry of physics and differential cohomology in a cohesive topos.
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.
(…)
Decidability
(…)
In the context of foundations of mathematics the term practical foundations (following a term introduced in (Taylor)) refers to emphasis on conceptually natural formalizations.

In my own education I was fortunate to have two teachers who used the term “foundations” in a common-sense way (rather than in the speculative way of the Bolzano-Frege-Peano-Russell tradition). This way is exemplified by their work in Foundations of Algebraic Topology, published in 1952 by Eilenberg (with Steenrod), and The Mechanical Foundations of Elasticity and Fluid Mechanics, published in the same year by Truesdell. The orientation of these works seemed to be “concentrate the essence of practice and in turn use the result to guide practice”. (Lawvere 2003: 213)

Formal systems of interest here are natural deduction in type theories, which allow natural expressions for central concepts in mathematics, notably via their categorical semantics and the conceptual strength of category theory (see Harper).
The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.


In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.

More generally, one may interpret type theory and notably dependent type theory as being a formal language for talking about slice categories, consisting of all morphisms into a given object.
Conversely, starting with a given theory of logic or a given type theory, we say that it has a categorical semantics if there is a category such that the given theory is that of its slice categories, if it is the internal logic of that category.

Of dependent type theory
We discuss how to interpret judgements of dependent type theory in a given category 𝒞\mathcal{C} with finite limits. For more see categorical model of dependent types.

f *:𝒞 /Γ′→𝒞 /Γ.

We give now rules for choices “[xyz][x y z]” that associate with every string “xyzx y z” of symbols in type theory objects and morphisms in 𝒞\mathcal{C}. A collection of such choices following these rules is an interpretation / a choice of categorical semantics of the type theory in the category 𝒞\mathcal{C}.

is to be interpreted as follows. The interpretation of the first two terms corresponds to a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C} of the form

The interpretation of the substitution statement is then the pullback
[Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type]:=[Γ⊢a:A] *[Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type],
  [\Gamma \vdash B[a/x] : Type]
  :=
  [\Gamma \vdash a : A]^* [\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]

hence the morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} that universally completes the above diagram as

Of homotopy type theory
See categorical semantics of homotopy type theory.
The theory of (∞,1)-toposes, generalizing topos theory from category theory to (∞,1)-category theory: “geometric homotopy theory”.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being


about logic


about geometry.


The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.


In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.


Whitehead's principle.


sets cover, and more generally n-types cover.


Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being


about logic


about geometry.


Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.
There are always two ways to think of topos theory: as being

Traditionally, as a discipline, logic is the study of correct methods of reasoning. Logicians have principally studied deduction, the process of passing from premises to conclusion in such a way that the truth of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive logic studies what it is for an argument to be valid. A second branch of logic studies induction, reasoning about how to assess the plausibility of general propositions from observations of their instances. This has often been done in terms of probability theory, particularly Bayesian.
Some philosophers, notably Charles Peirce, considered there to be third variety of reasoning for logic to study, namely, abduction. This is a process whereby one reasons to the truth of an explanation from its ability to account for what is observed. It is therefore sometimes also known as inference to the best explanation. At least some aspects of this can also be studied using Bayesian probability.
Deductive logic is the best developed of the branches. For centuries, treatments of the syllogism were at the forefront of the discipline. In the nineteenth century, however, spurred largely by the needs of mathematics, in particular the need to handle relations and quantifiers, a new logic emerged, known today as predicate logic.
As we said above, logic is traditionally concerned with correct methods of reasoning, and philosophers (and others) have had much to say prescriptively about logic. However, one can also study logic descriptively, taking it to be the study of methods of reasoning, without attempting to determine whether these methods are correct. One may study constructive logic, or a substructural logic, without saying that it should be adopted. Also psychologists study how people actually reason rapidly in situations without full information, such as by the fast and frugal approach.
A logic is a specific method of reasoning. There are several ways to formalise a logic as a mathematical object; see at Mathematical Logic below.
Topos theory is the part of category theory that studies categories which are toposes. This includes in particular Grothendieck toposes, i.e. categories of sheaves.

Continuum mechanics refers to the physics/mechanics of continuous bodies such as notably fluids? but also solids (solid state physics). As opposed to the mechanics of point particles (to which it is of course related by various limiting processes).
A Cauchy sequence is an infinite sequence which ought to converge in the sense that successive terms get arbitrarily close together, as they would if they were getting arbitrarily close to a limit. Among sequences, only Cauchy sequences will converge; in a complete space, all Cauchy sequence converge.
In measure theory, measure spaces are used in the general theory of measure and integration, somewhat analogous to the role played by topological spaces in the study of continuity.
For the general theory of measure spaces, we first need a measurable space (X,Σ)(X, \Sigma), that is a set equipped with a collection Σ\Sigma of measurable sets complete under certain operations. Then this becomes a measure space (X,Σ,μ)(X, \Sigma, \mu) by throwing in a function μ\mu from Σ\Sigma to a space of values (such as the real line) that gets along with the set-theoretic operations that Σ\Sigma has. If EE is a measurable set, then μ(E)\mu(E) is called the measure of EE with respect to μ\mu.



A topological manifold XX of dimension n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} is by definition a topological space that is locally homeomorphic to a Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n. A choice of such morphism
ϕ:ℝ n→≃X| im(ϕ)↪X
  \phi : \mathbb{R}^n \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X|_{im(\phi)} \hookrightarrow X


is a coordinate system or coordinate chart or just chart on the image of ϕ\phi.
This generalises to other sorts of manifolds.
An atlas is the collection of coordinate charts defining a manifold structure.

A manifold is a topological space which looks locally like a Cartesian space, commonly a finite-dimensional Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, in which case one speaks of a manifold of dimension nn or nn-fold, but possibly an infinite-dimensional topological vector space, in which case one has an infinite-dimensional manifold.
What “locally looks like” means depends on what sort of structure we are considering a Cartesian space to embody. At one extreme, we can think of ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as merely a topological space. Or, ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n may be considered as carrying more rigid types of structure, such as C kC^k-differential structure, smooth structure, piecewise-linear (PL) structure, real analytic structure, affine structure, hyperbolic structure, foliated structure, etc., etc. Accordingly we have notions of topological manifold, differentiable manifold, smooth manifold, analytic manifold etc. By default these are modeled on finite dimensional spaces, but most notions have generalizations to a corresponding notion of infinite dimensional manifold.

In any case, the type of geometry embodied in a particular flavor of manifold is controlled by a particular groupoid or, more generally, category of transformations which preserves whatever geometric features one is interested in; cf. Felix Klein’s Erlanger Programm.
If 1≤p<∞1\leq p \lt \infty and Ω\Omega is a domain (in a nn-dimensional real space with easy generalization to manifolds), one first considers the Lebesgue spaces L p=L p(Ω)L_p = L_p(\Omega) (wikipedia) of (equivalence classes of) measurable (complex- or real-valued) functions ff whose (absolute values of) pp-th powers are Lebesgue integrable; i.e. whose norm
‖f‖ L p=(∫ Ω|f| pdμ) 1/p\| f\|_{L_p} = \left(\int_\Omega |f|^p d\mu\right)^{1/p}
is finite. For p=∞p = \infty, one looks at the essential supremum norm ‖f‖ L ∞\|f\|_{L_\infty} instead.
For 1≤p≤∞1\leq p \leq \infty, and k≥1k\geq 1 the Sobolev space W p k=W p k(Ω)W^k_p = W^k_p(\Omega) or W k,p(Ω)W^{k,p}(\Omega) is the Banach space of measurable functions ff on Ω\Omega such that its generalized partial derivatives ∂ 1 i 1…∂ n i nf\partial_1^{i_1}\ldots\partial_n^{i_n} f (e.g. in the sense of generalized functions) for all multiindices i=(i 1,…,i n)∈ℤ ≥0 ni = (i_1,\ldots, i_n)\in\mathbb{Z}^n_{\geq 0} with i 1+…+i n≤ki_1+\ldots +i_n\leq k are in L p(Ω)L_p(\Omega). The most important case is the case of the Sobolev spaces H k(Ω):=W 2 k(Ω)H^k(\Omega) := W^k_2(\Omega). Sobolev spaces are particularly important in the theory of partial differential equations.

Dr. von Neumann, ich möchte gerne wissen, was ist denn eigentlich ein Hilbertscher Raum ? 1

A Hilbert space is (see Def.  for details):


a (real or, usually, complex) vector space, possibly of infinite dimension,


equipped with a positive definite Hermitian inner product,


which, as a topological space, is complete with respect to the induced metric.


Hilbert spaces are central to quantum physics and specifically to quantum mechanics, where they serve as spaces of pure quantum states. Here the inner product encodes the probability amplitudes for one pure state to “collaps” to another one under measurement. When the space of pure states is of finite dimension (as is the case of interest in quantum information theory/quantum computation) then the completeness condition on a Hilbert space is automatic (see Rem.  below), otherwise it naturally encodes the possibility of an infinite number of measurement outcomes.
Hilbert spaces with (bounded) linear maps between them form a (dagger-)category, often denoted Hilb or similar, with the dagger-structure given by sending bounded linear maps to their adjoint operators with respect to the Hermitian inner product. Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces form a dagger-compact category.
See also:

an elementary treatment of Hilbert spaces.

A nuclear vector space is a locally convex topological vector space that is as far from being a normed vector space as possible. Any map from a nuclear space into a normed vector space is compact, whence the only normed nuclear spaces are finite dimensional.
Nuclear spaces have very good properties with regard to topological tensor product?s and duality.
To define a nuclear space we need to start with the concept of a nuclear map, first between Banach spaces.
Let EE and FF be Banach spaces. Let ℒ(E,F)\mathcal{L}(E,F) be the Banach space of continuous linear maps E→FE \to F. Let E *E^* denote the dual Banach space of EE. Let E *⊗˜FE^* \widetilde{\otimes} F denote the completion of the projective tensor product of E *E^* and FF. The bilinear map E *×F→ℒ(E,F)E^* \times F \to \mathcal{L}(E,F) extends to a continuous linear map E *⊗˜F→ℒ(E,F)E^* \widetilde{\otimes} F \to \mathcal{L}(E,F) (which might not be injective).

Definition
Let EE and FF be Banach spaces. A linear map f:E→Ff \colon E \to F is nuclear if it lies in the image in ℒ(E,F)\mathcal{L}(E,F) of the completion of the projective tensor product E *⊗˜FE^* \widetilde{\otimes} F.

From the notion of nuclear maps between Banach spaces we can define nuclear maps between arbitrary LCTVS. In essence, a linear map between arbitrary LCTVS is nuclear if it factors through a nuclear map of Banach spaces.
To make this precise, we need to recall how to associate Banach spaces to certain subsets of an LCTVS. Let EE be an LCTVS and U⊆EU \subseteq E a convex circled 00-neighbourhood. Then we can define a Banach space E˜ U\widetilde{E}_U as follows: as UU is convex and circled, its Minkowski functional is a semi-norm on EE. The quotient E U≔E/kerUE_U \coloneqq E/\ker U is therefore a normed vector space. As UU is a 00-neighbourhood, the quotient mapping defines a continuous linear function E→E UE \to E_U. We define E˜ U\tilde{E}_U to be the Banach completion of E UE_U.
There is a dual notion. Let FF be an LCTVS and B⊆FB \subseteq F a convex, circled, and bounded subset of FF. Let F BF_B be the span of BB in FF. Then BB is absorbing in F BF_B and so its Minkowski functional is defined. If FF is Hausdorff then BB cannot contain a linear subspace and thus F BF_B is a normed vector space. We cannot complete F BF_B to a Banach space but it might so happen that it is one. As BB is bounded, the inclusion F B→FF_B \to F is continuous.
(There is no danger of confusing the two notations since if EE admits a bounded 00-neighbourhood then it is a normed vector space.)
Now we say that a continuous linear map f:E→Ff \colon E \to F is bounded if for some 00-neighbourhood UU of EE (which we may take to be circled and convex), f(U)f(U) is bounded in FF. In which case, ff factors through a continuous map f U,B:E U→F Bf_{U,B} \colon E_U \to F_B where B⊆FB \subseteq F is bounded and contains f(U)f(U).

Definition
Let EE and FF be LCTVS. A linear map f:E→Ff \colon E \to F is nuclear if there exists a convex circled 00-neighbourhood, say UU, in EE and a convex circled bounded, say BB, in FF with F BF_B complete such that f(U)⊆Bf(U) \subseteq B and the associated map f U,B:E˜ U→F Bf_{U,B} \colon \tilde{E}_U \to F_B is nuclear.

The following characterisation of nuclear maps is often helpful.

Lemma
A linear map f:E→Ff \colon E \to F is nuclear if and only if it is of the form:
u(x)=∑ n=1 ∞λ nf n(x)y n
u(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \lambda_n f_n(x) y_n


where ∑ n=1 ∞|λ n|<∞\sum_{n=1}^\infty {|\lambda_n|} \lt \infty, {f n}\{f_n\} is an equicontinuous sequence in E *E^*, and {y n}\{y_n\} is a sequence in FF contained in a convex, circled, bounded subset BB such that F BF_B is complete.

Now that we have the notion of a nuclear map, we can define a nuclear space.

Definition
A LCTVS EE is nuclear if it has a base ℬ\mathcal{B} of convex circled 00-neighbourhoods such that for V∈ℬV \in \mathcal{B} the canonical mapping E→E˜ VE \to \tilde{E}_V is nuclear.


The following are equivalent:

EE is nuclear,
Every continuous linear map of EE into any Banach space is nuclear,
Every convex, circled 00-neighbourhood UU contains another, say VV, such that the canonical map E˜ V→E˜ U\tilde{E}_V \to \tilde{E}_U is nuclear.


Every bounded subset of a nuclear space is precompact.
The completion of a nuclear space is a nuclear space.
A nuclear space is a projective limit of ℓ p\ell^p spaces (in particular, of Hilbert spaces).
Nuclearity is inherited by the following constructions: subspaces, separated quotients, arbitrary products, locally convex direct sum of a countable family, projective limits, countable inductive limits.
The projective tensor product (and its completion) of two nuclear spaces is nuclear.

An axiom is a proposition in logic that a given theory requires to be true: every model of the theory is required to make the axiom hold true. The sense however is that an axiom is a basic true proposition, used to prove other true propositions (the theorems) in the theory.
Given a language LL (perhaps specified by a signature: a collection of types, function symbols and relation symbols), a theory is the collection of assertions which are derivable (using the rules of deduction of the ambient logic or deductive system) from a given set of assertions, called axioms of the theory. In other words, a theory is generated from a set of axioms, by starting with those axioms and applying rules of deduction, much as terms in an algebraic system may be generated from a set of basic terms by applying operations. Axioms should therefore be considered as presenting a theory; different axiom sets may well give the same theory.
In terms of a deductive system, axioms can be regarded as “rules with zero hypotheses”. The form of such axioms depends on the details of the deductive system used: it could be natural deduction, sequent calculus, a Hilbert system, etc. If we take sequent calculus, for instance, then any collection of sequents written in the given language LL
ϕ→⊢ x→ψ→
  \vec{\phi} \vdash_{\vec x} \vec{\psi}


(asserting that “If every proposition ϕ i\phi_i is true in context x→\vec{x} then also some ψ i\psi_i is/has to be true”) can be taken as a collection of axioms for some theory. Models of the theory will then be those structures of the language in which the axioms are interpreted as true statements. For example, a model of group theory is a structure in the language of groups for which the group theory axioms hold, which is (of course) a group.
Assuming the deductive system is sound?, every sequent which is the conclusion of a valid sequent deduction, starting from the axioms, will also be true in every model. And if the deductive system is also complete, then every sequent of the language which is true in every model will in fact be provable from the axioms.

Hilbert's sixth problem asks for an axiomatization of physics.

We discuss the setting in which fundamental physics takes place.
Dynamics in space
Physics is dynamics in spaces .
Higher topos theory provides the formalizations of this most fundamental aspect of physics.


A general context for spaces is a big (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}.


A general context for geometrical spaces is a local (∞,1)-topos.


A general context for geometrical spaces and processes in these spaces is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


An example of relevance for much of physics is the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞LieGrpd of ∞-Lie groupoids. This contains


smooth manifolds;


orbifolds;


diffeological spaces;


smooth path spaces;


In its Cahiers topos-version it contains also


infinitesimal spaces;


such as ∞-Lie algebroids.


de Rham spaces, smooth D-modules;


In its full derived geometry-version it contains also

derived ∞-Lie algebroids such as the BV-BRST complexes of gauge theories.

Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos comes with its intrinsic notion of cohomology. This encodes kinematics in physics. Such as orientation; spin structures; string structures, fivebrane structures.
Every cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is in particular a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos. For these their intrinsic cohomology refines to differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos classifying connections on ∞-bundles. This encodes dynamics in physics: a connection on a principal ∞\infty-bundle is a gauge field which exerts forces. Such as:

the electromagnetic field, Yang-Mills field, the field of gravity, of supergravity, the Kalb-Ramond field, the supergravity C-field, the RR-field.

In every such connected (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos every characteristic class gives rise to its ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism that sends gauge fields encoded as ∞-connections on principal ∞-bundles to circle n-bundles with connection. Such as:

the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle known from the Green-Schwarz mechanism or the Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle known from dual heterotic string theory.

Under the higher parallel transport of these circle nn-bundles with connection, this assignment is the action functional for the ∞-Chern-Simons theory of the corresponding characteristic class. This includes as special cases various sigma-model quantum field theories such as:

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, ordinary Chern-Simons theory, all versions of AKSZ theory, (Chern-Simons-)supergravity, BF-theory coupled to topological Yang-Mills theory with cosmological constant.

These are all topological quantum field theories. But by the holographic principle of higher category theory we have that on their boundaries live non-topological theories:


on the boundary of Chern-Simons theory sits the Wess-Zumino-Witten model.


on the boundary of the A-model sits the quantum mechanics dynamics of any classical symplectic phase space and on the boundary of the Poisson sigma-model that of a Poisson manifold phase space.


Quantum dynamics
The quantum mechanics associated with such sigma-models is the collection of data given by


on each closed piece Σ d−n\Sigma_{d-n} of worldvolume cobordism of codimension nn the n-vector space of states of the system;


on each piece with boundary ∂Σ in→Σ←∂Σ out\partial \Sigma_{in} \to \Sigma \leftarrow \partial \Sigma_{out} a morphism between these nn-vector spaces encoding the propagation of states;


on each open subset U⊂ΣU \subset \Sigma the algebra of observables .


Two dual formalizations axiomatize this:


AQFT/factorization algebras: the assignment of algebras of observables is encoded in an (∞,n)-copresheaf of ∞-algebras on Σ\Sigma with suitable properties;


FQFT: the assignment of spaces of states and propagators is encoded in an (∞,n)-functor on the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms (see cobordism hypothesis).


Well-understood examples of such quantum field theories include


AQFT:


2-dimensional conformal field theory by conformal nets and vertex operator algebra


topological chiral homology




FQFT:


2-dimensional conformal field theory (see FFRS-formalism)


TCFTs ((∞,1)-category-formulations of 2d TQFT): the A-model, the B-model, their duality under homological mirror symmetry




Quantization
By the above there is a fairly well-developed formalization of


background gauge fields and their sigma-model action functional;


quantum field theories.


The idea is that the former induce examples of the latter by a process called quantization. This is imagined to be given by a path integral over the action functional.
This step in full generality is not yet well understood formally. For a list of literature addressing this problem see Literature on quantization.
But special aspects of quantization are quite well understood. See for instance


deformation quantization


geometric quantization, multisymplectic geometry


Hopf-algebraic renormalization


We look at some aspects of the above general abstract story in more detail.
Gauge theory
Introduction
The discovery of gauge theory is effectively the discovery of groupoids in fundamental physics. The notion of gauge transformation is close to synonymous to the notion isomorphism and more generally to equivalence in an (∞,1)-category .
From a modern point of view, the mathematical model for a gauge field in physics is a cocycle in (nonabelian) differential cohomology: a principal bundle with connection and its higher analogs. These naturally do not form just a set, but a groupoid and generally an ∞-groupoid, whose morphisms are gauge transformations, and higher morphisms are gauge-of-gauge transformations. The development of differential cohomology has to a fair extent been motivated by and influenced by its application to fundamental theoretical physics in general and gauge theory in particular.
Around 1850 Maxwell realized that the field strength of the electromagnetic field is modeled by what today we call a closed differential 2-form on spacetime. In the 1930s Dirac observed that more precisely this 2-form is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)-principal bundle with connection, hence that the electromagnetic field is modeled by what today is called a degree 2-cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology .
Meanwhile, in 1915, Einstein had identified also the field strength of the field of gravity as the 𝔰𝔬(d,1)\mathfrak{so}(d,1)-valued curvature 2-form of the canonical O(d,1)-principal bundle with connection on a d+1d+1-dimensional spacetime Lorentzian manifold. This is a cocycle in differential nonabelian cohomology: in Chern-Weil theory.
In the 1950s Yang-Mills theory identified the field strength of all the gauge fields in the standard model of particle physics as the 𝔲(n)\mathfrak{u}(n)-valued curvature 2-forms of U(n)-principal bundles with connection. This is again a cocycle in differential nonabelian cohomology.

Entities of ordinary gauge theory
Lie algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge Lie group GG – connection with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal bundle over a smooth manifold XX.

It is noteworthy that already in this mathematical formulation of experimentally well-confirmed fundamental physics the seed of higher differential cohomology is hidden: Dirac had not only identified the electromagnetic field as a line bundle with connection, but he also correctly identified (rephrased in modern language) its underlying cohomological Chern class with the (physically hypothetical but formally inevitable) magnetic charge located in spacetime. But in order to make sense of this, he had to resort to removing the support of the magnetic charge density from the spacetime manifold, because Maxwell’s equations imply that at the support of any magnetic charge the 2-form representing the field strength of the electromagnetic field is in fact not closed and hence in particular not the curvature 2-form of an ordinary connection on an ordinary bundle.
In (Freed) this old argument was improved by refining the model for the electromagnetic field one more step: Dan Freed notices that the charge current 3-form is itself to be regarded as a curvature, but for a connection on a circle 2-bundle with connection – also called a bundle gerbe – , which is a cocycle in degree 3 ordinary differential cohomology. Accordingly, the electromagnetic field is fundamentally not quite a line bundle, but a twisted bundle with connection, with the twist being the magnetic charge 3-cocycle. Freed shows that this perspective is inevitable for understanding the quantum anomaly of the action functional for electromagnetism is the presence of magnetic charge.
In summary, the experimentally verified models, to date, of fundamental physics are based on the notion of (twisted) U(n)U(n)-principal bundles with connection for the Yang-Mills field and O(d,1)O(d,1)-principal bundles with connection for the description of gravity, hence on nonabelian differential cohomology in degree 2 (possibly with a degree-3 twist).
In attempts to better understand the structure of these two theories and their interrelation, theoretical physicists were led to consider variations and generalizations of them that are known as supergravity and string theory. In these theories the notion of gauge field turns out to generalize: instead of just Lie algebras, Lie groups and connections with values in these, one finds structures called Lie 2-algebras, Lie 2-groups and the gauge fields themselves behave like generalized connections with values in these.

Entities of 2-gauge theory
Lie 2-algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge Lie 2-group GG – connection on a 2-bundle with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal 2-bundle/gerbe over an orbifold XX.

Notably the string is charged under a field called the Kalb-Ramond field or BB-field which is modeled by a BU(1)\mathbf{B}U(1)-principal 2-bundle with connection, where BU(1)\mathbf{B}U(1) is the Lie 2-group delooping of the circle group: the circle Lie 2-group. Its Lie 2-algebra B𝔲(1)\mathbf{B}\mathfrak{u}(1) is given by the differential crossed module [𝔲(1)→0][\mathfrak{u}(1) \to 0] which has 𝔲(1)\mathfrak{u}(1) shifted up by one in homological degree.
So far all these differential cocycles were known and understood mostly as concrete constructs, without making their abstract home in differential cohomology explicit. It is the next gauge field that made Freed and Hopkins propose (FreedHopkins, Freed) that the theory of differential cohomology is generally the formalism that models gauge fields in physics:
The superstring is charged also under what is called the RR-field, a gauge field modeled by cocycles in differential K-theory. In even degrees we may think of this as a differential cocycle whose curvature form has coefficients in the ∞-Lie algebra ⊕ n=0 ∞B 2n𝔲(1)\oplus_{n=0}^\infty \mathbf{B}^{2 n} \mathfrak{u}(1). Here b 2n𝔲(1)b^{2n} \mathfrak{u}(1) is the abelian 2n-Lie algebra whose underlying complex is concentrated in degree 2n2 n on ℝ\mathbb{R}.
So fully generally, one finds ∞-Lie algebras, ∞-Lie groups and gauge fields behaving like connections with values in these.

Entities of general gauge theory
∞-Lie algebra𝔤\mathfrak{g} with gauge ∞-Lie group GG – connection on an ∞-bundle with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g} on GG-principal ∞-bundle over an ∞-Lie groupoid XX.

The curvature characteristic forms / Chern characters in the abelian formulation of differential cohomology take values in abelian ∞-Lie algebras and are therefore effectively nothing but differential forms with values in a complex of vector spaces, but more generally in ∞-Chern-Weil theory on nonabelian principal ∞-bundles, the curvatures forms themselves take values in general ∞-Lie algebras, such as the string Lie 2-algebra, the supergravity Lie 3-algebra and the fivebrane Lie 6-algebra.
Apart from generalizing the notion of gauge Lie groups to Lie 2-groups and further, structural considerations in fundamental physics also led theoretical physicists to consider models for spacetime that are more general than than the notion of a smooth manifold. In string theory spacetime is allowed to be more generally an orbifold or a generalization thereof, such as an orientifold. The natural mathematical model for these generalized spaces are Lie groupoids or, essentially equivalently, differentiable stacks .
It is noteworthy that the notions of generalized gauge groups and the generalized spacetime models encountered this way have a natural common context: all of these are examples of smooth ∞-groupoids.
There is a natural mathematical concept that serves to describe contexts of such generalized spaces: a gros (∞,1)-topos. The notion of differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos provides a unifying perspective on the mathematical structure encoding the generalized gauge fields and generalized spacetime models encountered in modern theoretical physics in such a general context.
Classes of examples
We discuss classes of examples of gauge theories that have been considered. For all of these the configuration space is a space of connections on ∞-bundles {∇}\{\nabla\} over spacetime XX of sorts, which one might take to be the defining property of a gauge theory. But there are different types of action functionals on these configuration spaces.
Generalized Yang-Mills theory
In Yang-Mills theory the action functional is of the form
∇↦∫ X⟨F ∇∧⋆F ∇⟩,
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla \rangle
  \,,


where


F ∇F_\nabla is the curvature differential form,


“⋆\star” the Hodge star operator with respect to a fixed (pseudo-)Riemannian metric-structure on XX


and ⟨−⟩\langle -\rangle some invariant polynomial.


This is the original notion of gauge theory and might be taken to be the strict sense of the term.


For gauge group G=U(1)G = U(1) the circle group this is electromagnetism;


For gauge group a general nonabelian Lie group GG this is Yang-Mills theory proper.


Specifically for GG a discrete quotient of SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) this is the gauge-field part of the standard model of particle physics.


For structure group G=BU(1)G = \mathbf{B}U(1) the circle 2-group this yields the Kalb-Ramond field


For structure group G=B 2U(1)G = \mathbf{B}^2U(1) the circle 3-group this yields the supergravity C-field.


For structure group the K-theory spectrum we get differential K-theory describing the RR-field.


A nonabelian cohomology version of higher Yang-Mills theory – replacing a connection on a bundle by a connection on a 2-bundle is expected to control certain 6-dimensional theories that compactify to ordinary Yang-Mills on the torus and thereby explain S-duality . See there for more details on this.
∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory
In ∞-Chern-Simons theory the action functional is of the form
∇↦∫ XCS(∇),
  \nabla \mapsto \int_X CS(\nabla)
  \,,



where CS(−)CS(-) is a Chern-Simons element for an invariant polynomial ⟨−⟩\langle - \rangle on an ∞-Lie algebroid 𝔞\mathfrak{a}.

This includes ordinary Chern-Simons theory in the case that 𝔞\mathfrak{a} is a semisimple Lie algebra, but for general 𝔞\mathfrak{a} it subsumes a wide variety of types of TQFTs that are often counted as of different type than Chern-Simons theory, such as BF-theory and AKSZ theory.
The action functional of ∞-Chern-Simons theory stands out by the fact that it arises by general abstract construction:


the underlying Lagrangian CS(∇)CS(\nabla) is nothing but the ∞-Chern-Weil homomorphism
CS(−):BG diff→B nU(1) diff 
  CS(-) : \mathbf{B}G_{diff} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{diff}


induced by the given invariant polynomial ⟨−⟩\langle - \rangle. This sends gauge fields in the form of GG-valued connections on ∞-bundles to the circle n-bundle with connection whose higher parallel transport is given by the Lagrangian;


the integral over CS(∇)CS(\nabla) is induced by postcomposition with the trunction morphism
H(Σ,BG conn)→CS(−)H(Σ,B nU(1) diff)≃∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))→∫ Στ n−dimΣ∞Grpd(Π(Σ),B nU(1))≃B n−dimΣU(1).
  \mathbf{H}(\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}) 
    \stackrel{CS(-)}{\to} 
   \mathbf{H}(\Sigma,\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{diff}) 
   \simeq 
   \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), B^n U(1)) 
  \stackrel{\int_\Sigma}{\to} 
    \tau_{n-dim \Sigma}
    \infty Grpd(\Pi(\Sigma), B^n U(1)) \simeq B^{n-dim \Sigma} U(1) 
  \,.



For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a semisimple Lie algebra equipped with its Killing form invariant polynomial we have that CS(−)CS(-) is the ordinary Chern-Simons element and ∫ XCS(∇)\int_X CS(\nabla) the ordinary Chern-Simons theory action functional. This may be understood as the higher parallel transport of a Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle with connection.


For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a semisimple Lie algebra equipped with its degree 8 invariant polynomial this yields 7-dimensional, whose action functional may be understood as the higher parallel transport of a Chern-Simons circle 7-bundle with connection.


For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a symplectic Lie n-algebroid equipped with its canonical invariant polynomial ω\omega of degree n+2n+2 ∫ XCS ω(−)\int_X CS_\omega(-) is the actional functional of AKSZ theory:


for n=1n = 1 this is the Poisson sigma-model;


for n=2n = 2 this is the Courant sigma-model.




For 𝔞\mathfrak{a} a Lie 2-algebra equipped with the Killing form invariant polynomial, ∫ XCS(−)\int_X CS(-) is the action functional of BF-theory coupled to topological Yang-Mills theory with a cosmological constant.


Gravity
The configuration spaces of gravity and supergravity may be identified with spaces of connections on ∞-bundles with gauge group a variant of the Poincare group. This parameterization of the configuration space of gravity is known as the first order formulation of gravity, to be contrasted with a formulation explicitly over a space of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.


The special orthogonal group SOS O-component of the connection in this case is called the spin connection;


the translation group-component of ∇\nabla is called the vielbein.


For the ordinary Poincare group this yields the Palatini action expression for the standard Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity.
In contrast to the ∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory discussed above, the general abstract nature, if any, of the action functional for gravity remains somewhat inconclusive and subject of a plethora of speculations. If one passes from connections to their associated Dirac operators and interprets these as parts of a spectral triple there is the spectral action functional on the space of spectral triples. This we discuss in more detail below.
There are various higher group extensions of the Poincare group and the orthonormal group that lead accordingly to higher order variations of gravity.


lifting SOS O-connections through the smooth Whitehead tower
⋯→Fivebrane→String→Spin→SO→O

spin structures and spin group-principal bundles with connection.
This lift is necessary to cancel the quantum anomaly of spinning particles coupled to gravity;

This lift is necessary to cancel the quantum anomaly of heterotic superstrings;

11-dimensional supergravity is a gauge theory for the supergravity Lie 6-algebra.



Phenomenological models: the standard model and gravity
Theoretical physics consists of two parts: theory and models, laws and initial conditions, axioms and phenomenology.
For instance the theory called general relativity describes the classical dynamics of gravity, but does not predict the value of the cosmological constant. Rather, for each choice of the latter does the theory predict a certain dynamics the large-scale universe.
The theory that describes the fundamental forces and particles except gravity is Yang-Mills theory. This, too, does not predict the fundamental particle species seen in experiments, but for a correct choice and identification of these, the theory does predict the dynamics of these particles, as observed in accelerators.
The total collection of these choices of fundamental particles that are observed in experiments is called the standard model of particle physics. It consists basically of


a choice of gauge group GG, such that all observed gauge fields are components of a connection on a GG-principal bundle;


a choice of linear representation ρ\rho of GG, such that all observed fermion fields are components of sections of a ρ\rho-associated bundle.


What precisely the “standard” model of particle physics is changes slightly over time, as new experimental insights are gained. Its particles were added item-by-item as they were discovered. More recently the mass of the particles called neutrinos, which was originally thought to be precisely 0, was measured to be very small, but non-vanishing.
The standard model as far as understood today exhibits a curious mixture of pattern and irregularity. This seems to suggest that it ought to have a more fundamental description in terms of a conceptually simpler structure out of which these patterns with their irregularities emerge. Since also the force of gravity is not presently included in the quantization of the standard model, it may seem plausible that this underlying structure is related to quantum gravity.
We discuss in the following some of the proposals that have been suggested for how to formalize this situation.
Spectral standard model and gravity
A fundamental relativistic particle is technically a 1-dimensional sigma-model QFT on 1-dimensional cobordisms with target the spacetime XX that it propagates in. Since both gravity as well as Yang-Mills fields are encoded in connections it is plausible to assume that the only background field on XX that the particle couples to is a connection ∇ ρ\nabla_\rho on a ρ\rho-associated bundle over a GG-principal bundle.
Here


roughly every semisimple Lie algebra summand in 𝔤=Lie(G)\mathfrak{g} = Lie(G) is one gauge field – a bosonic field;


every irreducible representation that ρ\rho decomposes into is one matter particle species – a fermion field.


This way a single σ\sigma-model may encode a rich multiple particle content and we shall speak of a single superparticle with different excitations or modes .
An early proposal for a single unified connection ∇\nabla that would subsume both gravity as well as Yang-Mills forces in a phenomenologically realistic way is the Kaluza-Klein mechanism. This assumes a single Levi-Civita connection but on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold XX which is locally of the product form X 4×F dX_4 \times F_{d} with X 4X_4 a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold and F dF_d a dd-dimensional Riemannian manifold of very small Riemannian volume. As described in more detail at Kaluza-Klein mechanism, this makes the isometry groups of F dF_d appear as extra gauge group factors as seen on X 4X_4. As also described in more detail there, while this Ansatz does reproduce the correct general form of gravity coupled to Yang-Mills forces, in its original form it does also have some phenomenologically unviable aspects.
It was observed by Alain Connes and collaborators that the Kaluza-Klein mechanism works better when used not internal to the category Diff of smooth manifolds but in context for more general geometry: noncommutative geometry. This is the content of the Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model.
This more general geometry turns out to model exactly the most general σ\sigma-model backgrounds for a 1-dimensional FQFT: because such is algebraically specified by


the (Hilbert) space ℋ\mathcal{H} of states that it assigns to the point;


An associative algebra A↪ℋA \hookrightarrow \mathcal{H} whose multiplication operation A⊗A→AA\otimes A \to A is the operator product assigned to the trivalent interaction vertex
•  ↘   • →  ↗ •
  \array{
    \bullet
    \\
    & \searrow
    \\
    && \bullet & \to

    \\
    \bullet
  }



A Dirac operator DD whose Dyson formula exponential exp(tD 2+θD)\exp(t D^2 + \theta D) is assigned to a piece of 1-dimensional cobordism of superlength (t,θ)(t, \theta).


This data is that of spectral triple, which is well known to enocode Riemannian noncommutative geometry (rather: spectral geometry ). It is therefore natural to search for a Kaluza-Klein ansatz in spectral geometry that would produce the standard model context.
A very detailed such construction was given by Alain Connes (see the references below).
It turns out that the realistic model has KK-theory dimension D=4+6D = 4+6.
By the result at (1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory this KK-theory dimension is precisely the intrinsic dimension of target space as seen by the superparticle. Moreover, D=4+6D = 4+6 is precisely the dimension for which the 2-dimensional super-CFT sigma-model is critical and hence allows to lift the 1-dimensional superparticle described here to string theory.
This means that Connes’ spectral triple whose particle spectrum reproduces the standard model of particle physics has a chance of being the point particle limit or decategorification of the kind of 2-spectral triple – a 2-dimensional superconformal field theory – of the kind that is considered in string theory. If so the lift of Connes’ model to the corresponding element in the moduli space of 2-spectral triples called the landscape of string theory vacua might provide, via the second quantization of the latter, a (perturbative) quantization of the spectral action of the former.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.

Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.

Yoneda extension


Universal properties are commonly used in mathematics, often without mentioning the term “universal property”.
For example, if one were asked to give a map ℝ→ℝ×ℂ\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{C}, they might write down something like x↦(x 2,x+ix)x \mapsto (x^2, x + i x). In effect, what is done is that a pair of maps ℝ→ℝ\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} and ℝ→ℂ\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C} is given, namely (x↦x 2,x↦x+ix)(x \mapsto x^2, x \mapsto x + i x). The universal property of the product says that giving a map to A×BA \times B is the same as giving a map to AA and a map to BB, and moreover this correspondence is natural in some precise sense.
Similarly, given rings RR and SS, if we want to extend a ring homomorphism R→SR \to S to a homomorphism from the polynomial ring R[x]→SR[x] \to S, all we have to do is to specify an element of SS that we send xx to. In other words, a homomorphism R[x]→SR[x] \to S is the same as a homomorphism R→SR \to S and an element of SS.
For it to be a universal property, just the existence of such a bijection is not sufficient. We will need some conditions to make sure the bijection is “natural”. Abstractly, this says that the bijection is given by a natural isomorphism of certain functors. More concretely, by the Yoneda lemma, this is equivalent to saying the bijection is “mediated” by some “universal maps”, which is how universal properties are usually formulated. See Concrete examples for more details.
Recall that by the Yoneda lemma, specifying how we can map in or out of an object uniquely determines the object up to isomorphism. So we can use these universal properties as definitions of the constructions! These are known as universal constructions. Of course, these definitions are not actually “constructions”. We still have to do the concrete constructions the good, old way to show that there are objects satisfying the universal property (or apply general theorems such as the adjoint functor theorem).
Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

Working in the 1-category Set of 0-categories amounts to doing set theory. The point of sheaf toposes is to pass to parameterized 0-categories, namely presheaf categories. Although these topoi behave much like the 1-topos Set, their objects are generalized spaces that may carry more structure. For instance, a (pre)sheaf on Diff is a generalized smooth space.

The idea of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes is to generalize the above situation from 11 to (∞,1)(\infty,1) (recall the notion of (n,r)-category and see the general discussion at ∞-topos):

Working in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd of (∞,0)-categories amounts to doing homotopy theory. The point of (∞,1)-sheaves is to pass to parameterized (∞,0)-categories, namely (∞,1)-presheaf categories. Although these (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi behave much like the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd, their objects are generalized spaces with higher homotopies that may carry more structure. More generally we have topoi of sheaves, and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi of (∞,1)-sheaves. For instance, an ∞-Lie groupoid is an (∞,1)-sheaf on CartSp.

Global sections geometric morphism
Every ∞-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism to the terminal ∞\infty-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd: the direct image is the global sections (∞,1)-functor Γ\Gamma, the inverse image is the constant ∞-stack functor
(LConst⊣Γ):H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConst∞Grpd.
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma)

  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


In fact, this is unique, up to equivalence: Since every ∞\infty-groupoid is an 


(

,

)

(\infty,1)

-colimit (namely over itself, by this Prop.) of the point (hence of the terminal object), and since the inverse image ∞\infty-functor LConstLConst needs to preserve these ∞\infty-colimits (being a left adjoint) as well as the point (being a lex functor).
Closed monoidal structure

Proposition
Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.


Proof
By the fact that every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits it follows that for every object XX the (∞,1)-functor
X×(−):H→H
  X \times (-) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}


preserves all (∞,1)-colimits. Since every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a locally presentable (∞,1)-category it follows with the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem that there is a right adjoint (∞,1)-functor
(X×(−)⊣[X,−]):H→[X,−]←X×(−)H.
  (X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{X \times (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} \mathbf{H}
  \,.



Proposition
For CC an (∞,1)-site for H\mathbf{H} we have that the internal hom (mapping stack) [X,−][X,-] is given on A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} by the (∞,1)-sheaf
[X,A]:U↦H(X×Ly(U),A),
  [X,A] \,\colon\, U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U), A)
  \,,


where y:C→Hy : C \to \mathbf{H} is the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding and L:PSh C→HL : PSh_C \to \mathbf{H} denotes ∞-stackification.


Proof
The argument is entirely analogous to that of the closed monoidal structure on sheaves.
We use the full and faithful geometric embedding (L⊣i):H↪PSh C(L \dashv i) : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow PSh_C and the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma to find for all U∈CU \in C the value
[X,A](U)≃PSh C(yU,[X,A])
  [X,A](U) \simeq PSh_C(y U, [X,A])


and then the fact that ∞-stackification LL is left adjoint to inclusion to get
⋯≃H(Ly(U),[X,A]).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(L y(U), [X,A])
  \,.


Then the defining adjunction (X×(−)⊣[X,−])(X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) gives
⋯≃H(X×Ly(U),A).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U) , A)
  \,.

By definition, for any S∈Grpd ∞S \in Grpd_\infty and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the powering] is the (∞,1)-limit over the diagram constant on XX

while the tensoring is the (∞,1)-colimit over the diagram constant on XX

Remark
Under Isbell duality, the powering operations on homotopy types XX corresponds to higher order Hochschild cohomology of suitable algebras of functions on XX, as discussed there.

Slice-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object, the slice-(∞,1)-category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos – an over-(∞,1)-topos. The projection π !:H /X→H\pi_! : \mathbf{H}_{/X} \to \mathbf{H} part of an essential geometric morphism
π:H /X→π *←π *→π !H.
  \pi : \mathbf{H}_{/X} 
  \stackrel{\overset{\pi_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\pi_*}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


This is HTT, prop. 6.3.5.1.
The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} could be called the gros topos of XX. A geometric morphism K→H\mathbf{K} \to \mathbf{H} that factors as K→≃H /X→πH\mathbf{K} \xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathbf{H}_{/X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} \mathbf{H} is called an etale geometric morphism.
Syntax in univalent homotopy type theory
(∞,1)(\infty,1)-Toposes provide categorical semantics for homotopy type theory with a univalent Tarskian type of types (which inteprets as the object classifier).
For more on this see at


model of type theory in an (infinity,1)-topos


relation between type theory and category theory – Univalent homotopy type theory and infinity-toposes


A cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a gros (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} that provides a context of generalized spaces in which higher geometry makes sense, in particular higher differential geometry. See also at motivation for cohesive toposes for a non-technical discussion.
Technically, it is an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos whose global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism (Disc⊣Γ):H⟶Γ←Disc(Disc \dashv \Gamma): \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}  ∞Grpd admits a further left adjoint (∞,1)-functor Π\Pi and a further right adjoint coDisccoDisc:
(Π⊣Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):H→∞Grpd
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd


with DiscDisc and coDisccoDisc both full and faithful (∞,1)-functors and such that Π\Pi moreover preserves finite (∞,1)-products. (For a notion of cohesion relative to a general base, see Remark .)
Here


the existence of coDisccoDisc induces a sub-(∞,1)-quasitopos Conc(H)↪HConc(\mathbf{H}) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} of concrete objects that behave like ∞-groupoids equipped with extra cohesive structure , such as with continuous structure, smooth structure, etc.


the existence of Π\Pi induces a notion of geometric fundamental ∞-groupoid, hence under |−|:∞Grpd≃|-| : \infty Grpd \simeq  Top of geometric realization |Π(−)||\Pi(-)| of objects in H\mathbf{H}.


The functor Γ\Gamma itself may be thought of as sending a cohesive ∞-groupoid XX to its underlying bare ∞\infty-groupoid Γ(X)\Gamma(X). This is XX with all cohesion forgotten (for instance with the continuous or the smooth structure forgotten).
Conversely, DiscDisc and CoDiscCoDisc send an ∞\infty-groupoid AA either to the discrete ∞-groupoid Disc(A)Disc(A) with discrete cohesive structure (for instance with discrete topology) or to the codiscrete ∞-groupoid Codisc(A)Codisc(A) with the codiscrete cohesive structure (for instance with codiscrete topology).
This kind of adjoint quadruple, directly analogous to the structure introduced by William Lawvere for cohesive toposes, induces three adjoint modalities which in turn are adjoint to each other, to yield the adjoint string shape modality ⊣\dashv flat modality ⊣\dashv sharp modality ∫⊣♭⊣♯\int \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp, which may be thought of as expressing “continuum” and “quantity” in the sense of Georg Hegel‘s Science of Logic (as explained in detail there.)
The existence of such an adjoint quadruple of adjoint (∞,1)(\infty,1)-functors alone implies a rich internal higher geometry in H\mathbf{H} that comes with its internal notion of Galois theory, Lie theory, differential cohomology, Chern-Weil theory.
Examples of cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes include


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} = Disc∞Grpd of discrete ∞-groupoids;


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids;


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids;


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  SynthDiff∞Grpd of formal smooth ∞-groupoids;


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  Super∞Grpd of super ∞-groupoids;


the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  SmoothSuper∞Grpd of smooth super ∞-groupoids.


In ETop∞Grpd and those contexts containing it, the internal notions of geometric realization, geometric homotopy and Galois theory subsume the usual ones (over well-behaved topological spaces). In Smooth∞Grpd also the notions of Lie theory, differential cohomology and Chern-Weil theory subsume the usual ones. In SynthDiff∞Grpd the internal notion of Lie algebra and Lie algebroid subsumes the traditional one — and generalizes them to higher smooth geometry.
We state the definition in several equivalent ways.


externally in the ambient context;


internally to the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos itselfs;


internally and formulated in homotopy type theory


Externally
The definition is the immediate analog of the definition of a cohesive topos.

Definition
An (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} is cohesive if


it is a strongly ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos;


it is a local (∞,1)-topos.




Remark
As always in topos theory and higher topos theory, such definitions can be made sense of over any base . Here: over any base (∞,1)-topos. For instance, differential algebraic K-theory may be understood via cohesion over a base of ∞-stacks over a site of arithmetic schemes (see there).
Over the canonical base ∞Grpd of ∞-groupoids, the definition of a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is equivalently the following:
the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism Γ:H→∞Grpd\Gamma : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd lifts to an adjoint quadruple of adjoint (∞,1)-functors
(Π⊣Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):H←coDisc⟶Γ←Disc⟶Π∞Grpd
  (\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\longrightarrow}}{\overset{Disc}{\leftarrow}}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\leftarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \;


where Π\Pi preserves finite (∞,1)-products.
Often we will tacitly assume to work over ∞Grpd. But most statements and constructions have straightforward generalizations to arbitrary bases. In particular, below in the internal definition of cohesion, it takes more to fix the base topos than to leave it arbitrary.
Every adjoint quadruple induces an adjoint triple of endofunctors.
(Π⊣♭⊣#):H⟶Γ←Disc⟶Π∞Grpd⟶coDisc←Γ⟶DiscH.
  (
   \mathbf{\Pi}
   \dashv 
   \mathbf{\flat}
   \dashv 
   \mathbf{#}
  )
  :
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Disc}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


Here “♭\mathbf{\flat}” is meant to be pronounced “flat”. The interpretation of these three functors is discussed in detail at cohesive (∞,1)-topos – structures.

Sometimes it is desireable to add further axioms, such as the following.

Definition
We say that pieces have points for an object XX in a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} if the points-to-pieces transform
ΓX→ΓDiscΠX≃ΠX
  \Gamma X \to \Gamma Disc \Pi X \simeq \Pi X


is an effective epimorphism in an (∞,1)-category, equivalently (as discussed there) such that this is an epimorphism on connected components.

Here the first morphismism is the image under Γ\Gamma of the (Disc⊣Γ)(Disc \dashv \Gamma)-unit and the second is an inverse of the (Π⊣Disc)(\Pi \dashv Disc)-counit (which is invertible because DiscDisc is full and faithful in a local (∞,1)-topos.)

Definition
We say discrete objects are concrete in H\mathbf{H} if for all S∈S \in ∞Grpd the morphism
DiscS→coDiscΓDiscS⟶≃coDiscS
  Disc S \to coDisc \Gamma Disc S \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} coDisc S


induces monomorphisms on all homotopy sheaves.

The following extra condition ensures that the shape modality is explicitly given by a geometric path ∞-groupoid construction.

Definition
Given a cohesive ∞\infty-topos H\mathbf{H} and an object 𝔸 1∈H\mathbb{A}^1 \in \mathbf{H}, we say that 𝔸 1\mathbb{A}^1 exhibits the cohesion if the shape modality Π\Pi is equivalent to “A1-localization” L 𝔸 1L_{\mathbb{A}^1}, hence to localization of H\mathbf{H} at the class of projection morphisms of the form (−)×𝔸 1⟶(−)(-)\times \mathbb{A}^1 \longrightarrow (-), i.e. if
Π≃L 𝔸 1.
  \Pi \simeq L_{\mathbb{A}^1}
  \,.



Remark
In the example of smooth cohesion and its variants such as Euclidean topological cohesion, the standard real line 𝔸 1=ℝ 1\mathbb{A}^1 = \mathbb{R}^1 exhibits cohesion in the sense of def.  (by this discussion). Therefore one might also say that if an object 𝔸 1\mathbb{A}^1 in a cohesive ∞\infty-topos exhibits the cohesion, then it plays the role of the continuum in analogy of the traditional use of this term in geometry. See also at continuum – In cohesive homotopy theory.

Another extra axiom is (see at Aufhebung for more):

Definition
Say that a cohesive ∞\infty-topos, def. , has Aufhebung of becoming if the sharp modality preserves the initial object
♯∅≃∅.
  \sharp \emptyset \simeq \emptyset
  \,.


Internally
We reformulate the above axioms for a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos without references to functors on it, and instead entirely in terms of structures in it.

Lemma
A full sub-(∞,1)-category B↪H\mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} is


reflectively embedded precisely if for every object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} there is a morphism
loc X:X→LX
  loc_X : X \to L X


(the unit) with LX∈B↪HL X \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H}, such that for all Y∈B↪HY \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} the value of the (∞,1)-categorical hom-space-functor
H(loc X,Y):H(LX,Y)⟶≃H(X,Y)
  \mathbf{H}(loc_X, Y) : 
  \mathbf{H}(L X, Y)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}(X, Y)


is an equivalence (of ∞-groupoids).


coreflectively embedded precisely if for every object Y∈HY \in \mathbf{H} there is a morphism
coloc Y:RY→Y
  coloc_Y : R Y \to Y


(the counit) with RY∈B↪HR Y \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} such that for all X∈B↪HX \in \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} the value of the (∞,1)-categorical hom-space-functor
H(X,coloc Y):H(X,RY)→≃H(X,Y)
  \mathbf{H}(X, coloc_Y) : 
  \mathbf{H}(X, R Y)
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \mathbf{H}(X, Y)


is an equivalence (of ∞-groupoids).



This is proven here.

Lemma
A reflective embedding
coDisc:B cod↪coDisc←Γ˜H
  coDisc : \mathbf{B}_{cod} \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow}} \mathbf{H}


and a coreflective embedding
Disc:B disc←Γ↪DiscH
  Disc : \mathbf{B}_{disc} \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}} \mathbf{H}


fit into a single adjoint triple
H↩coDisc→Γ↩DiscB
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{
      \overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}
    }{
     \stackrel{  
       \overset{\Gamma}{\to}
     }{
       \underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}
     }
   }
  \mathbf{B}


(hence there is an equivalence B disc≃B cod\mathbf{B}_{disc} \simeq \mathbf{B}_{cod} that moreover makes the coreflector Γ˜\tilde\Gamma of DiscDisc coincide with the reflector Γ\Gamma of coDisccoDisc) precisely if for the unit and counit given by lemma  we have that the morphisms on the left of
(1)coDiscΓ˜(DiscΓX→X)=:(coDiscΓ˜DiscΓX→≃coDiscΓ˜X)
  
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma (Disc \Gamma X \to X)
  \;
  =:
  \;
  (coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma X

   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma X)

(2)DiscΓ(X→coDiscΓ˜X)=:(DiscΓX→≃DiscΓcoDiscΓ˜) 
  
  Disc \Gamma (X \to coDisc \tilde \Gamma X)
  \;\;
   =:
  \;\;
  (
    Disc \Gamma X 
     \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
    Disc \Gamma coDisc \tilde \Gamma
  )


are (natural) equivalences for all objects X∈HX \in \mathbf{H}, as indicated on the right.


Proof
It is clear that if we have an adjoint triple, then (1) and (2) are implied. We discuss now the converse.
First notice that the two embeddings always combine into an adjunction of the form
B disc←Γ↪DiscH↩coDisc→Γ˜B cod.
  \mathbf{B}_{disc}
   \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\tilde \Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}
  \mathbf{B}_{cod}    
  \,.


The natural equivalence (1) applied to a codiscrete object X:=coDiscAX := coDisc A gives that coDisccoDisc of the counit of this composite adjunction is an equivalence
coDiscΓ˜DiscΓcoDiscA→≃coDiscΓ˜coDiscA→≃coDiscA
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  coDisc A


for all AA, and since coDisccoDisc is full and faithful, so is the composite counit
Γ˜DiscΓcoDiscA→≃Γ˜coDiscA→≃A
  \tilde \Gamma Disc \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  \tilde \Gamma coDisc A
    \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  A  


itself. Analogously, (2) implies that the unit of the composite adjunction is an equivalence. Therefore (1) and (2) together imply that the adjunction itself exhibits an equivalence B disc≃B cod\mathbf{B}_{disc} \simeq \mathbf{B}_{cod}.
Using this we then find for each X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} a composite natural equivalence
DiscΓ˜X→≃DiscΓcoDiscΓ˜X→≃DiscΓX
  Disc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma coDisc \tilde \Gamma X
   \stackrel{\simeq}{\to}
  Disc \Gamma X


where the first morphism uses the above equivalence on the codiscrete object Γ˜X\tilde \Gamma X and the second is a choice of natural inverse of (2).
Since DiscDisc is full and faithful, this mean that we have equivalences
Γ˜X≃ΓX
  \tilde \Gamma X 
   \simeq 
  \Gamma X


natural in XX, hence that Γ˜≃Γ\tilde \Gamma \simeq \Gamma.


Remark
In the above situation, the defining adjunction equivalence
H(ΠX,A)≃H(X,♭A)
  \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi} X , A)
    \simeq 
  \mathbf{H}(X, \flat A) 


exhibiting (Π⊣♭)(\mathbf{\Pi} \dashv \flat) is given by the composite of natural equivalences
H(ΠX,A)→≃H(ΠX,coloc A) −1H(ΠX,♭A)→≃H(loc X,♭A)H(X,♭A)
    \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}X, A)
     \underoverset{\simeq}{\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}X, coloc_A)^{-1}}{\to}
     \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi} X, \flat A)
   \underoverset{\simeq}{\mathbf{H}(loc_X, \flat A)}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}(X, \flat A) 


from lemma , using that both ΠX\mathbf{\Pi} X as well as ♭A\flat A are discrete.

Using these lemmas we can now restate cohesiveness internally.

Corollary
For Disc:B↪HDisc : \mathbf{B} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} a sub-(∞,1)-category, the inclusion extends to an adjoint quadruple of the form
H↩coDisc→Γ↩Disc→ΠB
  \mathbf{H}
    \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}}}
  \mathbf{B}


precisely if there exists for each object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H}


a morphism X→Π(X)X \to \mathbf{\Pi}(X) with Π(X)∈B↪DiscH\mathbf{\Pi}(X) \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H};


a morphism ♭X→X\mathbf{\flat} X \to X with ♭X∈B↪DiscH\mathbf{\flat} X \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H};


a morphism X→#XX \to #X  with #X∈B↪coDiscH# X \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}


such that for all Y∈B↪DiscHY \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H} and Y˜∈B↪coDiscH\tilde Y \in \mathbf{B} \stackrel{coDisc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H} the induced morphisms


H(ΠX,Y)→≃H(X,Y)\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{\Pi}X , Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,Y);


H(Y,♭X)→≃H(Y,X)\mathbf{H}(Y, \mathbf{\flat}X) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(Y,X);


H(#X,Y˜)→≃H(X,Y˜)\mathbf{H}(# X , \tilde Y) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathbf{H}(X,\tilde Y);


#(♭X→X)# (\flat X \to X);


♭(X→#X)\flat (X \to # X)


are equivalences (the first three of ∞-groupoids the last two in H\mathbf{H}).
Moreover, if H\mathbf{H} is a cartesian closed category, then Π\Pi preserves finite products precisely if the DiscDisc-inclusion is an exponential ideal.

The last statement follows from the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category analog of the discussion here.
In homotopy type theory
The axioms for cohesion, in the internal version, can be formulated in homotopy type theory, the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos.
The corresponging Coq-HoTT code is in (Shulman).
For more see cohesive homotopy type theory.
We discuss basic properties implied by the axioms for cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes in


As a point-like space;


General.


Over arbitrary bases


Then we discuss presentations over special sites in

Over an ∞-cohesive site.

As a point-like space

Proposition
A nontrivial cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos


has the shape of the point;


has homotopy dimension 0;


has cohomology dimension 0.




Proof
The first holds for every ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos, see there.
The second holds for every local (∞,1)-topos, see there.
The third follows from the second, see homotopy dimension.


Remark
This says that a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} is, when itself regarded as a little topos, a generalized space, a thickened point . We may think of it as the standard point equipped with a cohesive neighbourhood .
In this sense every space XX modeled on the cohesive structure defined by H\mathbf{H} is an étale space over XX: its petit (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H/X\mathbf{H}/X sits by a locally homeomorphic geometric morphism over H\mathbf{H}
H/X→localhomeoH.
  \mathbf{H}/X \stackrel{local\;homeo}{\to} \mathbf{H}
  \,.


Over an ∞\infty-cohesive site
We discuss a presentation of classes of cohesive (∞,1)-toposes by a model structure on simplicial presheaves over a suitable site.

Proposition
For CC an ∞-cohesive site the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves (∞,1)Sh(C)(\infty,1)Sh(C) over CC is a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos satisfying the two axioms pieces have points and discrete objects are concrete .

The detailed discussion is at ∞-cohesive site.
General

Proposition
Every cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over ∞Grpd is a hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
By the above proposition it has finite homotopy dimension. This implies hypercompeteness. See there.


Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos, the (1,1)-topos τ ≤1−1H\tau_{\leq 1-1} \mathbf{H} of 0-truncated objects is a cohesive topos.


Proposition
For a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos (Π⊣Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc):H→∞Grpd(\Pi \dashv Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) : \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd over an ∞-cohesive site, the functor Π\Pi preserves (∞,1)-pullbacks over discrete objects.

We first consider a lemma. Notice that for A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd the (∞,1)-Grothendieck construction gives an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
∞Grpd /A≃Func(A,∞Grpd)
  \infty Grpd_{/A} \simeq Func(A, \infty Grpd)


from the over (∞,1)-category of ∞Grpd\infty Grpd over AA to the (∞,1)-functor (∞,1)-category from AA to ∞Grpd\infty Grpd.

Lemma
For H\mathbf{H} a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over an ∞-cohesive site and for A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd, we have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
H /DiscA≃Func(A,H).
  \mathbf{H}_{/ Disc A} \simeq Func(A, \mathbf{H})
  \,.



Proof
We establish this via a presentation of H\mathbf{H} by a model structure on simplicial presheaves.
Let CC be an ∞-cohesive site of definition for H\mathbf{H}. Then by the discussion there we have
H≃([C op,sSet] proj,loc) ∘.
  \mathbf{H} \simeq ([C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc})^\circ
  \,.


Moreover, picking a Kan complex presentation for AA, which we shall denote by the same symbol, we have that the constant simplicial presheaf constA∈[C op,sSet] proj,locconst A \in [C^{op}, sSet]_{proj, loc} is fibrant. Therefore by this proposition the induced model structure on an overcategory on [C op,sSet]/constA[C^{op}, sSet]/const A presents the given over (∞,1)-category
H /DiscA≃(([C op,sSet]/constA) (proj,loc)/constA) ∘.
  \mathbf{H}_{/ Disc A}
  \simeq
  \left(
   \left([C^{op}, sSet]/const A\right)_{(proj,loc)/const A}
  \right)^\circ
  \,.


Now observe that we have an ordinary equivalence of categories
[C op,sSet]/constA≃[C op,sSet/A]
  [C^{op}, sSet]/const A 
   \simeq
  [C^op, sSet/A]


under which the model structure becomes that of the local projective model structure on functors with values in the model structure (sSet/A) Quillen/A(sSet/A)_{Quillen/A} that presents ∞Grpd /A\infty Grpd_{/ A}.
Let then sSet +/AsSet^+/A denote the model structure for left fibrations. By the discussion there, this also presents ∞Grpd /A\infty Grpd_{/ A}. Hence by this proposition we have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
H DiscA ≃([C op,sSet/A] proj,loc) ∘  ≃([C op,sSet +/A] proj,loc) ∘.
  \begin{aligned}
   \mathbf{H}_{Disc A}
   & \simeq
  \left(
    [C^{op}, sSet/A]_{proj,loc}
  \right)^\circ
  \\
  & \simeq
  \left(
   [C^{op}, sSet^+/A]_{proj,loc}
  \right)^\circ
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


This allows now to apply this presentation of the (∞,1)-Grothendieck construction to find
⋯≃([C op,[w(A),sSet Quillen] proj] proj,loc) ∘,
  \cdots \simeq
  \left(
   [C^{op}, [w(A), sSet_{Quillen}]_{proj}]_{proj,loc}
  \right)^\circ
  \,,  


where w(A)w(A) is the simplicially enriched category corresponding to AA (as discussed at relation between quasi-categories and simplicial categories ) and [w(A),sSet Quillen] proj[w(A), sSet_{Quillen}]_{proj} is the global model structure on sSet-enriched presheaves.
Then using the cartesian closure of the category of simplicial presheaves (which is a topos) inside the (−) ∘(-)^\circ we have
⋯≃([w(A),[C op,sSet Quillen] proj,loc] proj) ∘.
  \cdots
  \simeq
  \left(
   [w(A), [C^{op}, sSet_{Quillen}]_{proj,loc}]_{proj}
  \right)^\circ
  \,.


Finally this implies the claim using this proposition.

With this lemma we can now give the proof of prop. .

Proof
By the discussion at adjoint (∞,1)-functors on slices we have that (Π⊣Disc)(\Pi \dashv Disc) induces an adjoint pair
(Π/DiscA⊣Disc/DiscA):H DiscA→∞Grpd /A.
  (\Pi/Disc A \dashv Disc / Disc A)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}_{Disc A}
  \to 
  \infty Grpd_{/A}

  \,.


Under the equivalence from lemma  the functor Π/DiscA\Pi/Disc A maps to
Func(A,Π):Func(A,H)→Func(A,∞Grpd).
  Func(A, \Pi) : 
  Func(A, \mathbf{H}) \to 
  Func(A, \infty Grpd)
  \,.


Since products of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-functor (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories are computed objectwise, and since Π\Pi preserves finite products by the axioms of cohesion, also Func(A,Π)Func(A, \Pi) preserves finite products, and hence so does Π/DiscA\Pi/Disc A. But products in the slice over DiscADisc A are (∞,1)-pullbacks over DiscADisc A. So this proves the claim.

Base of discrete and codiscrete objects
In the internal definition the base of discrete/codiscrete objects is not explicitly axiomatized to be an (∞,1)-topos itself (the base (∞,1)-topos), but this is implied by the axioms. We deduce that and related properties in stages.
In the following, let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos equipped with an adjoint quadruple of functors to an (∞,1)-category B\mathbf{B} – the base of cohesion, where DiscDisc and coDisccoDisc are full and faithful.

Proposition
The base B\mathbf{B} of cohesion has all (∞,1)-limits and (∞,1)-colimits.


Proof
This is a general property of a reflectively and coreflectively embedded subcategory. The limits are computed by computing them in H\mathbf{H} and then applying Γ\Gamma and the colimits are computed by computing them in H\mathbf{H} and then applying Π\Pi. For X:I→BX : I \to \mathbf{B} any diagram we have
Γlim ← iDiscX i ≃lim ← iΓDiscX i  ≃lim ← iX i
  \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma \lim_{\leftarrow_i} Disc X_i
    & \simeq
    \lim_{\leftarrow_i} \Gamma Disc X_i 
    \\
    & \simeq 
    \lim_{\leftarrow_i}  X_i 
  \end{aligned}

Πlim → iDiscX i ≃lim ← iΠDiscX i  ≃lim ← iX i.
  \begin{aligned}
    \Pi \lim_{\to_i} Disc X_i
    & \simeq
    \lim_{\leftarrow_i} \Pi Disc X_i 
    \\
    & \simeq 
    \lim_{\leftarrow_i}  X_i 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.



Remark
Since DiscDisc, being both a left adjoint as well as a right adjoint preserves limits and colimits, it follows that a (co)limit of discrete objects computed in H\mathbf{H} is itself again discrete and is the image under DiscDisc of the coresponding (co)limit computed in B\mathbf{B}.


Example
Since loop space objects are (∞,1)-limits it follows that the loop space object of any discrete object is itself again a discrete object.

We have also the following stronger statement.

Proposition
The base of cohesion B\mathbf{B} is a presentable (∞,1)-category and in fact an (∞,1)-topos itself.


Proof
By one of the equivalent characterizations of presentable (∞,1)-categories these are reflective sub-(∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-categories of (∞,1)-presheaves where the embedding is by an accessible (∞,1)-functor.
Since H\mathbf{H} is itself accessibly and reflectively embedded into the presheaves PSh(C)PSh(C) on a (∞,1)-site of definition, we have a composite reflective inclusions
B↪DiscH↪PSh(C).
  \mathbf{B}
  \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow}
  \mathbf{H}
  \hookrightarrow
  PSh(C)
  \,.


Since DiscDisc even preserves all (∞,1)-colimits, it is in particular an accessible (∞,1)-functor, hence so is the above composite.
Finally, since Γ\Gamma preserves all (∞,1)-limits, hence in particular the finite limits, (Γ,coDisc)(\Gamma, coDisc) is a geometric embedding that exhibits an sub-(∞,1)-topos.

Notice that the reflection (Π⊣Disc)(\Pi \dashv Disc) does not in general constitute a geometric embedding, since Π\Pi is only required to preserve finite products (and in interesting examples rarely preserves more limits than that).
The following statement and its proof about cohesive 1-toposes should hold verbatim also for cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes.

Proposition
The reflective subcategories of discrete objects and of codiscrete objects are both exponential ideals.


Proof
By the discussion at exponential ideal a reflective subcategories of a cartesian closed category is an exponential ideal precisely if the reflector preserves products. For the codiscrete objects the reflector Γ\Gamma preserves even all limits and for the discrete objects the reflector Π\Pi does so by assumotion of strong connectedness.

Factorization systems associated to Π\mathbf{\Pi}
We discuss orthogonal factorization systems in a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos that characterize or are characterized by the reflective subcategory of dicrete objects, with reflector Π:H→Π∞Grpd↪DiscH\mathbf{\Pi} : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\Pi}{\to} \infty Grpd \stackrel{Disc}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}.

Definition
For f:X→Yf : X \to Y a morphism in H\mathbf{H}, write c Πf→Yc_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f \to Y for the (∞,1)-pullback in
c Πf → ΠX ↓  ↓ Πf Y → ΠY,
  \array{
    c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f &\to & \mathbf{\Pi} X
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{\Pi} f}}
    \\
    Y &\to& \mathbf{\Pi} Y
  }
  \,,


where the bottom morphism is the (Π⊣Disc)(\Pi \dashv Disc)-unit. We say that c Πfc_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f is the Π\mathbf{\Pi}-closure of ff, and that ff is Π\mathbf{\Pi}-closed if X≃c ΠfX \simeq c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f.


Proposition
If H\mathbf{H} has an ∞-cohesive site of definition, then every morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y in H\mathbf{H} factors as
X  →f  Y  ↘  ↗   c Πf,
  \array{
     X &&\stackrel{f}{\to}&& Y
     \\
     & \searrow && \nearrow
     \\
     && c_{\mathbf{\Pi}}f 
  }
  \,,


such that X→c ΠfX \to c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f is a Π\mathbf{\Pi}-equivalence in that it is inverted by Π\mathbf{\Pi}.


Proof
The factorization is given by the naturality of Π\mathbf{\Pi} and the universal property of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback in def. .
X → c Πf → ΠX   f↘ ↓  ↓ Πf   Y → ΠY.
  \array{
    X &\to & c_{\mathbf{\Pi}} f &\to & \mathbf{\Pi} X
    \\
    &{}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow & \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{\Pi} f}}
    \\
    && Y &\to& \mathbf{\Pi} Y
  }
  \,.


Then by prop.  the functor Π\mathbf{\Pi} preserves the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback over the discrete object ΠY\mathbf{\Pi}Y and since Π(X→ΠX)\mathbf{\Pi}(X \to \mathbf{\Pi}X) is an equivalence, it follows that Π(X→c Πf)\mathbf{\Pi}(X \to c_{\mathbf{\Pi}f}) is an equivalence.


Proposition
The pair of classes
(Π−equivalences,Π−closedmorphisms)
  (\mathbf{\Pi}-equivalences, \mathbf{\Pi}-closed morphisms)


is an orthogonal factorization system in H\mathbf{H}.


Proof
This follows by the general reasoning discussed at reflective factorization system:
By prop.  we have the required factorization. It remains to check the orthogonality.
So let
A → X ↓  ↓ B → Y
  \array{
     A &\to& X 
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow 
     \\
     B &\to& Y
  }


be a square diagram in H\mathbf{H} where the left morphism is a Π\mathbf{\Pi}-equivalence and the right morphism is Π\mathbf{\Pi}-closed. Then by assumption there is a pullback square on the right in
A → X → ΠX ↓  ↓  ↓ B → Y → ΠY..
  \array{
     A &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}X 
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow  && \downarrow
     \\
     B &\to& Y &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.


By naturality of the adjunction unit, the total rectangle is equivalent to
A → ΠA → ΠY ↓  ↓ ≃  ↓ B → ΠB → ΠX.
  \array{
    A &\to& \mathbf{\Pi} A &\to & \mathbf{\Pi} Y
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}} && \downarrow
    \\
    B &\to& \mathbf{\Pi} B &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}X
  }
  \,.


Here by assumption the middle morphism is an equivalence. Therefore there is an essentially unique lift in the square on the right and hence a lift in the total square. Again by the universality of the adjunction, any such lift factors through ΠB\mathbf{\Pi} B and hence also this lift is essentially unique.
Finally by universality of the pullback, this induces an essentially unique lift σ\sigma in
A → X → ΠX ↓  σ↗ ↓  ↓ B → Y → ΠY..
  \array{
     A &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}X 
     \\
     \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\sigma}}\nearrow& \downarrow  && \downarrow
     \\
     B &\to& Y &\to& \mathbf{\Pi}Y
     \,.
  }
  \,.



Observation
For f:X→Yf : X \to Y a Π\mathbf{\Pi}-closed morphism and y:*→Yy : * \to Y a global element, the homotopy fiber X y:=y *XX_y := y^* X is a discrete object.


Proof
By the def.  and the pasting law we have that y *Xy^* X is equivalently the ∞\infty-pullback in
y *X →  → ΠX ↓    ↓ * →y Y → ΠY.
  \array{
    y^* X &\to& &\to& \mathbf{\Pi} X
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{y}{\to}& Y &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbf{\Pi}Y
  }
  \,.


Since the terminal object is discrete, and since the right adjoint DiscDisc preserves ∞\infty-pullbacks, this exhibits y *Xy^* X as the image under DiscDisc of an ∞\infty-pullback of ∞\infty-groupoids.

We list examples of cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes, both specific ones as well as classes of examples constructed in a certain way.
Cohesive diagram (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
Cohesive diagrams in a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos

Proposition
Let H\mathbf{H} be an cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos.
Let DD be a small category (diagram) with initial object ⊥\bottom and terminal object ⊤\top, or else a presentable (∞,1)-category. Write
(⊥⊣p⊣⊤):D↩⊤→p↩⊥*
  (\bottom \dashv p \dashv \top)
  :
  D \stackrel{\overset{\bottom}{\hookleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{p}{\to}}{\underset{\top}{\hookleftarrow}}}
  *


for the triple of adjoint (∞,1)-functors given by including ⊥\bottom and ⊤\top.
Then the (∞,1)-functor category H D\mathbf{H}^D is again a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos, exhibited by the adjoint quadruple which is the composite
H D↩⊥ *→⊥ *↩p *→⊤ *H↩coDisc→Γ↩Disc→Π∞Grpd,
  \mathbf{H}^D
   \stackrel{\overset{\top^*}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{p^*}{\hookleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\bottom^*}{\to}}{\underset{\bottom_*}{\hookleftarrow}}}}
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\hookleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\to}}{\underset{coDisc}{\hookleftarrow}}}}
  \infty Grpd
  \,,


where the adjoint quadruple on the left is that induced under (∞,1)-Kan extension from (⊥⊣p⊣⊤)(\bottom \dashv p \dashv \top).


Proof
By the discussion at (∞,1)-Kan extension each of the original three functors induces [adjoint triples  etc, as indicated. In particular  is a  and therefore preserves finite products (and all small , even).]
By the original adjunctions one finds that ⊥ !≃p *\bottom_! \simeq p^* and p !≃⊤ *p_! \simeq \top^*, which implies the adjoint quadruple as indicated above by essential uniqueness of adjoints.
Finally it is clear that ⊤ *p *≃Id\top^* p^* \simeq Id, which implies that p *p^* is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor (and hence so is ⊥ *\bottom_*).

In particular we have

Corollary
For H\mathbf{H} a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos, also its arrow (∞,1)-category H Δ[1]\mathbf{H}^{\Delta[1]} is cohesive.


Example
For H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞Grpd (“discrete cohesion”, see below) the corresponding cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd Δ[1]\infty Grpd^{\Delta[1]} is known as the Sierpinski (∞,1)-topos.

Simplicial objects in a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos
For H\mathbf{H} a cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos its (∞,1)-category of simplicial objects H Δ op\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}} is cohesive over H\mathbf{H}
H Δ op⟵coDisc I⟶Γ I⟵Disc I⟶Π IH.
  \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}}
  \stackrel{\Pi_I}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_I}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{\Gamma_I}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{coDisc_I}{\longleftarrow}}}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


Here


Π I\Pi_I sends a simplicial object to the homotopy colimit over its components, hence to its “geometric realization” as seen in H\mathbf{H}.


Γ I\Gamma_I evaluates on the 0-simplex;


Disc IDisc_I sends an object in H\mathbf{H} to the simplicial object which is simplicially constant on AA.


Hence cohesion of H Δ op\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}} relative to H\mathbf{H} expresses the existence of a discrete and directed notion of path.
The simplicial interval Δ 1∈H Δ op\Delta^1 \in \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}} (regarded under (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding) exhibits the cohesion of H Δ op\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}} over H\mathbf{H} in the sense of def. , in that the relative shape modality Π I\Pi_I is equivalent to the “A1-localization” at 𝔸 1=Δ 1\mathbb{A}^1 = \Delta^1
Π I≃L Δ 1.
  \Pi_I \simeq L_{\Delta^1}
  \,.


Notice that there is an inclusion
Grpd(H)↪Cat(H)↪H Δ op
  Grpd(\mathbf{H})
  \hookrightarrow
  Cat(\mathbf{H})
  \hookrightarrow
  \mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}}


of the groupoid objects internal to H\mathbf{H} and of the category objects internal to H\mathbf{H} inside H Δ op\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}}.
Here H Δ op\mathbf{H}^{\Delta^{op}} is also the classifying topos for linear intervals. Its homotopy type theory internal language is equipped with an interval type.

Bundles of cohesive spectra

Smooth cohesion over arbitrary base ∞\infty-toposes
The above examples relativize to arbitrary bases.
For instance smooth cohesion over an (∞,1)-topos over a suitable site of schemes is the natural context for differential algebraic K-theory. See there for more.
There are various different perspectives on the notion of topos. One is that a topos is a category that looks like a category of spaces that sit by local homeomorphisms over a given base space: all spaces that are locally modeled on a given base space.
The archetypical class of examples are sheaf toposes Sh(X)=Et(X)Sh(X) = Et(X) over a topological space XX: these are the categories of étale spaces over XX, topological spaces YY that are equipped with a local homeomorphisms Y→XY \to X.
When X=*X = * is the point, this is just the category Set of all sets: spaces that are modeled on the point. This is the archetypical topos itself.
What makes the notion of topos powerful is the following fact: even though the general topos contains objects that are considerably different from and possibly considerably richer than plain sets and even richer than étale spaces over a topological space, the general abstract category theoretic properties of every topos are essentially the same as those of Set. For instance in every topos all small limits and colimits exist and it is cartesian closed (even locally). This means that a large number of constructions in Set have immediate analogs internal to every topos, and the analogs of the statements about these constructions that are true in SetSet are true in every topos.
On the one hand this may be thought of as saying that toposes are very nice categories of spaces in that whatever construction on spaces one thinks of – for instance formation of quotients or of fiber products or of mapping spaces – the resulting space with the expected general abstract properties will exist in the topos. In this sense toposes are convenient categories for geometry – as in: convenient category of topological spaces, but even more convenient than that.
On the other hand, by de-emphasizing the geometric interpretation of their objects and just using their good abstract properties, this means that toposes are contexts with a powerful internal logic. The internal logic of toposes is intuitionistic higher order logic. This means that, while the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice may fail, apart from that, every logical statement not depending on these does hold internal to every topos.
For this reason toposes are often studied as abstract contexts “in which one can do mathematics”, independently of their interpretation as categories of spaces. These two points of views on toposes, as being about geometry and about logic at the same time, is part of the richness of topos theory.
On a third hand, however, we can de-emphasize the role of the objects of the topos and instead treat the topos itself as a “generalized space” (and in particular, a categorified space). We then consider the topos Sh(X)Sh(X) as a representative of XX itself, while toposes not of this form are “honestly generalized” spaces. This point of view is supported by the fact that the assignment X↦Sh(X)X\mapsto Sh(X) is a full embedding of (sufficiently nice) topological spaces into toposes, and that many topological properties of a space XX can be detected at the level of Sh(X)Sh(X). (This is even more true once we pass to (∞,1)-toposes.)
From this point of view, the objects of a topos (regarded as a category) should be thought of instead as sheaves on that topos (regarded as a generalized space). And just as sheaves on a topological space can be identified with local homeomorphisms over it, such “sheaves on a topos” (i.e. objects of the topos qua category) can be identified with other toposes that sit over the given topos via a local homeomorphism of toposes.
Finally, mixing this point of view with the second one, we can regard toposes over a given topos EE instead as “toposes in the EE-world of mathematics.” For this reason, the theory of toposes over a given base is formally quite similar to that of arbitrary toposes. And coming full circle, this fact allows the use of “base change arguments” as a very useful technical tool, even if our interest is only in one or two particular toposes qua categories.
‘What a topos is like:’
(i) ‘A topos is a category of sheaves on a site’
(ii) ‘A topos is a category with finite limits and power-objects’
(iii) ‘A topos is (the embodiment of) an intuitionistic higher-order theory’
(iv) ‘A topos is (the extensional essence of) a first-order (infinitary) geometric theory’
(v) ‘A topos is a totally cocomplete object in the meta-2-category CART of cartesian (i.e. , finitely complete) categories’
(vi) ‘A topos is a generalized space’
(vii) ‘A topos is a semantics for intuitionistic formal systems’
(viii) ‘A topos is a Morita equivalence class of continuous groupoids’
(ix) ‘A topos is the category of maps of a power allegory’
(x) ‘A topos is a category whose canonical indexing over itself is complete and well-powered’
(xi) ‘A topos is the spatial manifestation of a giraud frame’
(xii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic differential geometry’
(xiii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic domain theory’,
And so on. But the important thing about the elephant is that ‘however you approach it, it is still the same animal’. Elephant
Extensivity
Every topos is an extensive category. For Grothendieck toposes, infinitary extensivity is part of the characterizing Giraud's theorem. For elementary toposes, see toposes are extensive.
Adhesiveness
Every topos is an adhesive category. For Grothendieck toposes this follows immediately from the adhesion of Set, for elementary toposes it is due to (Lack-Sobocinski).
Epimorphisms
In a topos epimorphisms are stable under pullback and hence the (epi, mono) factorization system in a topos is a stable factorization system.
Relation to abelian categories
While crucially different from abelian categories, there is some intimate relation between toposes and abelian categories. For more on that see AT category.
Reasoning in a topos
Any result in ordinary mathematics whose proof is finitist and constructive automatically holds in any topos. If you remove the restriction that the proof be finitist, then the result holds in any topos with a natural numbers object; if you remove the restrictions that the proof be constructive, then the result holds in any boolean topos. On the other hand, if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in the weaker sense used by constructivists, then the result may fail in some toposes but holds in any Π\Pi-pretopos; if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in a stronger sense, then the result holds in any Heyting pretopos.
Therefore, one can prove results in toposes and similar categories by reasoning, not about the objects and morphisms in the topos themselves, but instead about sets and functions in the normal language of structural set theory, which is more familiar to most mathematicians. One merely has to be careful about what axioms one uses to get results of sufficient generality.
The internal language of a topos is called Mitchell-Bénabou language.
Specific examples and key results


The archetypical topos is Set. Notice that this happens to be a Grothendieck topos: it is the category of sheaves on the point.
The full subcategory FinSet is also an elementary topos, and the inclusion functor FinSet↪SetFinSet \hookrightarrow Set is a logical morphism. This is not a Grothendieck topos.
More generally, for κ\kappa a strong limit cardinal the full subcategory Set κSet_\kappa of sets or cardinality less than κ\kappa is a topos.


For CC any (small) site, the category of sheaves Sh(C)Sh(C) is a Grothendieck topos. Either by definition or by Giraud's theorem, every Grothendieck topos arises in this way. Important examples include:


The case where the Grothendieck topology is the trivial one, so that also all categories of presheaves (on small categories) are (Grothendieck) toposes.


The case of sheaves on (the site given by the category of open subsets of) a topological space, or more generally a locale.


The category GSetG Set of sets equipped with the action of a group GG: this is the topos of presheaves on the category BG\mathbf{B}G which is the delooping groupoid of GG.




Continuing the last example above, if GG is a topological group, the category GSetG Set of sets with a continuous action of G (that is, the action map G×X→XG\times X\to X is continuous, where XX has the discrete topology) is a topos, and in fact a Grothendieck topos (though this may not be obvious).


More generally, GG may be a topological groupoid, or even a localic groupoid. In fact, it is a theorem that every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the topos of “continuous sheaves” on a localic groupoid.


Again if GG is a topological group, the category Unif(G)Unif(G) of uniformly continuous GG-sets is also a topos, but not (in general) one of Grothendieck’s. For example, if GG is the profinite completion of ℤ\mathbb{Z}, then a continuous GG-set is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set all of whose orbits are finite, while a uniformly continuous one is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set with a finite upper bound on the size of all its orbits.


For EE a topos and X∈EX \in E any object, also the overcategory or slice category E/XE/X is again a topos. (Elephant, A.2.3.2). See also over-topos.


If EE is a topos and j:E→Ej \colon E \to E is a lex idempotent monad, the category of jj-algebras is a topos. Each such jj corresponds to a Lawvere-Tierney topology in EE, and the category of jj-algebras is equivalent to the category of sheaves for this topology. An example is the double-negation topology.


An obvious example of an elementary topos that is not a Grothendieck topos is the category FinSet of finite sets. More generally, for any strong limit cardinal κ\kappa, the category of sets of cardinality <κ\lt\kappa is an elementary topos, and as long as κ>ω\kappa \gt\omega it has a NNO. Set <κSet_{\lt \kappa} doesn’t even admit a geometric morphism to SetSet.


Since the definition of elementary topos is “algebraic,” there exist free toposes generated by various kinds of data. The category of toposes (and logical functors) is 2-monadic over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms. It has an initial object which is sometimes called the free topos. More generally, any higher-order type theory (of the sort which can be interpreted in the internal logic of a topos) generates a free topos containing a model of that theory. Such toposes (for a consistent theory) are never Grothendieck’s.


If GG is a large groupoid with a small set of objects, then the category [G,Set][G,Set] (which makes sense if we define “large” and “small” relative to a Grothendieck universe) is a topos, but not in general a Grothendieck topos. Note that this topos is in fact complete and cocomplete, but it does not have a small generating set, and so is an unbounded topos.


If ℱ\mathcal{F} is a filter of subterminal objects in any topos EE, then there is a filterquotient? topos E//ℱE//\mathcal{F}. Grothendieck-ness (and completeness and cocompleteness) are not in general preserved by this construction.


If CC and DD are toposes and F:C→DF\colon C\to D is a lex functor, then there is a topos Gl(F)Gl(F) called the Artin gluing of CC and DD along FF, and defined to be the comma category (D/F)(D/F). If CC and DD are Grothendieck toposes then Gl(F)Gl(F) is a SetSet-topos. If FF is accessible, then Gl(F)Gl(F) is again Grothendieck (hence bounded), but in general it may not be. (Note, though, that it is not clear whether it can be proven in ZFC that there exist any inaccessible lex functors between Grothendieck toposes, although from a proper class of measurable cardinals one can construct an inaccessible lex endofunctor of SetSet.)


The category of coalgebras for any lex comonad on a topos is again a topos: a topos of coalgebras, and if the comonad is accessible, this construction preserves Grothendieck-ness. If the comonad is not accessible, then this topos is unbounded.
For instance the Artin gluing Gl(F)Gl(F) is equivalent to the category of coalgebras for the comonad on the topos C×DC\times D defined by (c,d)↦(c,d×F(c))(c,d) \mapsto (c, d\times F(c)).


More generally, the category of coalgebras for any pullback-preserving comonad on a topos is again a topos. This covers both the preceding result and also the overcategory (slice category) result above, since E/XE/X is the category of coalgebras for the pullback-preserving comonad given by X×−:E→EX \times - \colon E \to E. It also covers Artin gluing along a pullback-preserving functor.


More generally still, Todd Trimble has a notion called a “modal operator” on a topos, from which one can construct a new topos of “GG-structures”: see Three topos theorems in one. Special cases include the pullback-preserving comonad result just mentioned, and the result that the category of algebras for a lex idempotent monad is a topos. A related idea is Toby Kenney’s notion of lex distributive diad?, from which one can also construct a topos.


From any partial combinatory algebra one can construct a realizability topos, whose internal logic is “computable” or “effective” mathematics relative to that PCA. In particular, for Kleene's first algebra, one obtains the effective topos, the most-studied of realizability toposes. Realizability toposes are generally not Grothendieck toposes.


A topos can also be constructed from any tripos. This includes realizability toposes as well as toposes of sheaves on locales.


Classes of examples
For various applications one uses toposes that have extra structure or properties.


In the foundations of mathematics, one often studies well-pointed toposes, especially models of ETCS as potential replacements for the category Set.


In synthetic differential geometry one studies smooth toposes as a context for axiomatic differential geometry.


One may interpret mathematical logic as being a formal language for talking about the collection of monomorphisms into a given object of a given category: the poset of subobjects of that object.
More generally, one may interpret type theory and notably dependent type theory as being a formal language for talking about slice categories, consisting of all morphisms into a given object.
Conversely, starting with a given theory of logic or a given type theory, we say that it has a categorical semantics if there is a category such that the given theory is that of its slice categories, if it is the internal logic of that category.
For the general idea, for the moment see at type theory the section An introduction for category theorists and see at relation between type theory and category theory.
Of dependent type theory
We discuss how to interpret judgements of dependent type theory in a given category 𝒞\mathcal{C} with finite limits. For more see categorical model of dependent types.
Write cod:𝒞 I→𝒞cod : \mathcal{C}^I \to \mathcal{C} for its codomain fibration, and write
χ:𝒞 op→Cat
  \chi : \mathcal{C}^{op} \to Cat


for the corresponding classifying functor, the self-indexing
χ:Γ↦𝒞 /Γ
  \chi : \Gamma \mapsto \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma}


that sends an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} to the slice category over it, and sends a morphism f:Γ→Γ′f : \Gamma \to \Gamma' to the pullback/base change functor
f *:𝒞 /Γ′→𝒞 /Γ.
  f^\ast : \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma'} 
  \to 
  \mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma}
  \,.


We give now rules for choices “[xyz][x y z]” that associate with every string “xyzx y z” of symbols in type theory objects and morphisms in 𝒞\mathcal{C}. A collection of such choices following these rules is an interpretation / a choice of categorical semantics of the type theory in the category 𝒞\mathcal{C}.
Contexts and type judgements


The empty context ()() in type theory is interpreted as the terminal object of 𝒞\mathcal{C}
[()]:=*.
  [ () ] := *
  \,.



If Γ\Gamma is a context which has already been given an interpretation [Γ]∈Obj(𝒞)[\Gamma] \in Obj(\mathcal{C}), then a judgement of the form
Γ⊢A:Type
  \Gamma \vdash A : Type


is interpreted as an object in the slice over [Γ][\Gamma]
[Γ⊢A:Type]∈Obj(𝒞 /Γ),
  [\Gamma \vdash A : Type] \in Obj(\mathcal{C}_{/\Gamma})
  \,,


hence as a choice of morphism
[(Γ,x:A)] ↓ [Γ⊢A:Type] [Γ]   
  \array{
    [(\Gamma, x : A)]
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    [\Gamma]
  }


in 𝒞\mathcal{C}.


If a judgement of the form Γ⊢A:Type\Gamma \vdash A : Type has already found an interpretation, as above, then an extended context of the form (Γ,x:A)(\Gamma, x : A) is interpreted as the domain object [(Γ,x:A)][(\Gamma, x : A)] of the above choice of morphism.


Terms
Assume for a context Γ\Gamma and a judgement Γ⊢A:Type\Gamma \vdash A : Type we have already chosen an interpretation [Γ,x:A]→[Γ⊢A:Type][Γ][\Gamma, x : A] \stackrel{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}{\to} [\Gamma] as above.
A judgement of the form Γ⊢a:A\Gamma \vdash a : A (a term of type AA) is to be interpreted as a section of this morphism, equivalently as a morphism in 𝒞 /[Γ]\mathcal{C}_{/[\Gamma]}
[Γ⊢a:A]:*→[Γ,x:A]   
  [\Gamma \vdash a : A] : * \to [\Gamma, x : A]


from the terminal object to [Γ⊢A:Type][\Gamma \vdash A : Type], which in 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a commuting triangle
[Γ]  →[(Γ⊢a:A)]  [Γ,x:A]   id [Γ]↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ].
  \array{
    [\Gamma] &&\stackrel{[(\Gamma \vdash a : A)]}{\to}&&
    [\Gamma, x : A]
    \\
    & {}_\mathllap{\mathrm{id}_{[\Gamma]}}\searrow
    &&
    \swarrow_{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    && [\Gamma]
  }
  \,.


Variables
For a term Γ⊢a:A\Gamma \vdash  a : A the context Γ\Gamma is the collection of free variables in aa.
(…)
Substitution
Assume that interpretations for judgements
Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type
  \Gamma , x : A \vdash B(x) : Type


and
Γ⊢a:A
  \Gamma \vdash  a : A


have been given as above. Then the substitution judgement
Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type
  \Gamma  \vdash B[a/x] : Type


is to be interpreted as follows. The interpretation of the first two terms corresponds to a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C} of the form
    [(Γ,x:A,y:B(x))]     ↓ [Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type] [Γ]  →[Γ⊢a:A]  [(Γ,x:A)]   id↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ]
  \array{
    &&&& [(\Gamma, x : A, y : B(x))]
    \\
    &&&&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]}}
    \\
    [\Gamma] &&\stackrel{[\Gamma \vdash a : A]}{\to}&&
     [(\Gamma, x : A)]
    \\
    & {}_{id}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    && [\Gamma]
  }


The interpretation of the substitution statement is then the pullback
[Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type]:=[Γ⊢a:A] *[Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type],
  [\Gamma \vdash B[a/x] : Type]
  :=
  [\Gamma \vdash a : A]^* [\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]
  \,,


hence the morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} that universally completes the above diagram as
[(Γ,y:B[x/a])]  →  [(Γ,x:A,y:B(x))]  [Γ⊢B[a/x]:Type]↓    ↓ [Γ,x:A⊢B(x):Type] [Γ]  →[Γ⊢a:A]  [(Γ,x:A)]   id↘  ↙ [Γ⊢A:Type]   [Γ]
  \array{
    [(\Gamma, y : B[x/a])]
    &&\to&& [(\Gamma, x : A, y : B(x))]
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{[\Gamma \vdash B[a/x] : Type]
}}\downarrow
    &&&&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{[\Gamma, x : A \vdash B(x) : Type]}}
    \\
    [\Gamma] &&\stackrel{[\Gamma \vdash a : A]}{\to}&&
     [(\Gamma, x : A)]
    \\
    & {}_{id}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{[\Gamma \vdash A : Type]}}
    \\
    && [\Gamma]
  }


Of homotopy type theory
See categorical semantics of homotopy type theory.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations

are precisely the diffeological spaces.
Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
On the very largest scales observable in astrophysical experiment, the cosmos is well described by an FRW model with cosmological constant Λ\Lambda (but see at inhomogeneous cosmology), with plenty of dark matter and with primordial cosmic inflation (called the Λ\Lambda-CDM “concordance model of cosmology”). A horizon in there and everything on smaller scales is the observable universe.
There has never been a reason to assume that beyond this cosmic horizon visible to us today, the cosmos would not extend further. In fact in the simple FRW models with positive cosmological constant, the spacetime manifold is not a closed manifold and extends indefinitely beyond our observable horizon. This is directly analogous to the ancient mariner who would stand on the deck of his ship and see a few miles of ocean around him. That was the world within his horizon, but there was no telling what lay beyond.
Therefore it is important to distinguish the observable universe from the universe as such. Unfortunately, intellectual laziness tended to ignore this distinction and at some point some people who said “universe” to mean just the stretch of our cosmic horizon felt the need to have a new term for whatever may lie beyond. For better or worse, that new term has become wide-spread these days and is “multiverse”.
The main scientific observation that goes with this is the observation that cosmic inflation – for which there is by now excellent and ever increasing experimental evidence that indeed it happened – does, at least by the simple method which is currently used to model it, naturally predict a large ambient space in which local regions stochastically undergo inflationary expansion. This scenario of chaotic inflation has in fact been singled out as the most likely one (within the standard model) by the bicep2-experiment in 2014.
In any case, as far as the observable universe is concerned, two facts are worth noticing:


the observable universe alone is already pretty darn large, see the various discussion of its scales below;


Giordano Bruno‘s old intuition remains plausible even at the largest scales: possibly the full xyz-verse beyond our present horizon is vastly larger still… and we may never know.

Recent measurements (c. 2001) by a number of ground-based and balloon-based experiments, including MAT/TOCO, Boomerang, Maxima, and DASI, have shown that the brightest spots are about 1 degree across. Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know that the universe is flat with only a 2% margin of error

While classical mechanics considers deterministic evolution of particles and fields, quantum physics follows nondeterministic evolution where the probability of various outcomes of measurement may be predicted from the state in a Hilbert space representing the possible reality: that state undergoes a unitary evolution, what means that the generator of the evolution is −1\sqrt{-1} times a Hermitean operator called the quantum Hamiltonian or the Hamiltonian operator of the system. The theoretical framework for describing this precisely is the quantum mechanics. It involves a constant of nature, Planck constant hh; some quantum systems with spatial interpretation in the limit h→0h\to 0 lead to classical mechanical systems (not all: some phenomena including non-integer spin are purely quantum mechanical, but the properties depending on their existence survive in the “classical” limit); in limited generality, one can motivate and find the nonfunctorial procedure to single out a right inverse to taking this classical limit under the name quantization.
While quantum mechanics may be formulated for a wide range of physical systems, interpreted as particles, extended particles and fields, the quantum mechanics of fields is often called the quantum field theory and the quantum mechanics of systems of a fixed finite number of particles is often viewed as the quantum mechanics in a narrow sense.
nPOV
Mathematically, despite the basic formalism of quantum mechanics which is sound and clear, there are two big areas which are yet not clear. One is to understand quantization, in all cases – of particles, fields, strings and so on. The second and possibly more central to nLab is a problem how to define rigorously a wide range of quantum field theories and some related quantum mechanical systems like the hypothetical superstring theory. Regarding that this is a central goal, we also put emphasis on the interpretation of quantum mechanics via the picture which is a special case of a FQFT, and where the time evolution functorially leads to evolution operators.
We discuss some basic notions of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanical systems
Recall the notion of a classical mechanical system: the formal dual of a real commutative Poisson algebra.

Definition
A quantum mechanical system is a star algebra (A,(−) *)(A, (-)^\ast) over the complex numbers. The category of of quantum mechanical systems is the opposite category of *\ast-algebras:
QuantMechSys:=*Alg ℂ op.
  QuantMechSys := {\ast}Alg_{\mathbb{C}}^{op}
  \,.



Remark
It makes sense to think of this as a deformed version of a real Poisson algebra as follows:


the Poisson-Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra corresponds to the commutator of the *\ast-algebra:
[a,b]:=ab−ba,
  [a,b] := a b - b a
  \,,



the commutative algebra structure of the Poisson algebra coresponds to the Jordan algebra structure of the *\ast-algebra, with commutative (but non-associative!) product
(a,b):=ab+ba.
  (a,b) := a b + b a
  \,.



With this interpretation the derivation-property of the Poisson bracket over the other product is preserved: for all a,b,c∈Aa,b,c \in A we have
[a,(b,c)]=([a,b],c)+(b,[a,c]).
  [a,(b,c)] = ([a,b],c) + (b,[a,c])
  \,.


We thus may regard a non-commutative star-algebra as a non-associative Poisson algebra : a Jordan-Lie algebra. See there for more details.

Observables and states

Definition
Given a quantum mechanical system in terms of a star algebra AA, we say


an observable is an element a∈Aa \in A such that a *=aa^\ast = a;


a state is a linear function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is positive in the sense that for all a∈Aa \in A we have ρ(aa *)≥0∈ℝ↪ℂ\rho(a a^\ast) \geq 0 \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}.




Remark
One can formalize the idea that a quantum mechanical system is like a deformed classical mechanical system as follows:
To every  *{}^\ast-algebra AA is associated its poset of commutative subalgebras Com(A)Com(A). Then the corresponding quantum mechanical system is a classical mechanical system internal to the sheaf topos Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)):


The *\ast-algebra canonically induces a commuative algebra A̲∈Sh(Com(A))\underline A \in Sh(Com(A));


the (classical) states of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) are in natural bijection with the quantum states externally on AA;


the (classical) observables of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) correspond to the external quantum observables on AA.


(…details…)

One also says that the internal classical mechanical system (Sh(Com(A)),A̲)(Sh(Com(A)), \underline{A}) is the “Bohrification” of the external quantum system AA. See there for more details.
Spaces of states
Given a *\ast-algebra AA together with a state ρ\rho on it, the GNS construction provides an inner product space H ρH_\rho together with an action of AA on H ρH_\rho and a vector Ω=(ρ)\Omega = \sqrt(\rho) – the vacuum vector? – such that for all a∈Aa \in A the value of the state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} is obtained by applying aa to ρ\sqrt{\rho} and then taking the inner product with ρ\sqrt \rho:
ρ(A)=⟨ρ,aρ⟩.
  \rho(A) = \langle \sqrt\rho, a \sqrt \rho\rangle
  \,.


If the star algebra AA happens to be a C-star algebra, then this inner product space is naturally a Hilbert space.
Historically and still often in the literature, such a Hilbert space is taken as a fundamental input of the definition of quantum systems.
Traditionally, Dirac‘s “bra-ket” notation is used to represent vectors in such Hilbert spaces of states, where |ψ⟩|\psi\rangle represents a state and ⟨ψ|\langle\psi| represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.
In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators ρ\rho, state evolution as maps of the form ρ↦U †ρU\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U for unitary maps UU, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM’s). There is a natural embedding of pure states into the space of density matrices: |ψ⟩↦|ψ⟩⟨ψ||\psi\rangle \mapsto |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|. So, one way to think of mixed states is a probabilistic mixture of pure states.
ρ=∑ ia i|ψ i⟩⟨ψ i| \rho = \sum_i a_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| 
Composite systems are formed by taking the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. If a pure state |Ψ⟩∈H 1⊗H 2|\Psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2 can be written as |ψ 1⟩⊗|ψ 2⟩|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle for |ψ i⟩∈H i|\psi_i\rangle \in H_i it is said to be separable. If no such |ψ i⟩|\psi_i\rangle exist, |Ψ⟩|\Psi\rangle is said to be entangled. If a mixed state is separable if it is the sum of separable pure states. Otherwise, it is entangled.
Flows and time evolution
As for classical mechanics, 1-parameter families of flows in a quantum mechanical system are induced from observables a∈Aa \in A by
ddλb λ=1iℏ[b λ,a].
  \frac{d}{d \lambda} b_\lambda = \frac{1}{i \hbar}[b_\lambda, a]
  \,.


In a non-relativistic system one specifies an observable HH – called the Hamiltonian – whose flow represents the time evolution of the system. (This is the Heisenberg picture.)
We comment on how to interpret this from the point of view of FQFT:
Quantum mechanics of point particles may be understood as a special case of the formalism of quantum field theory. It is interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical mechanics of point particles. Of course, we can take a configuration space of a system of particles looking like the configuration space of a single particle in a higher dimensional manifold.
Remark: related query on the relation between QFT and quantum mechanics (of particles and in general) can be found here.
One may usefully think of the quantum mechanics of a point particle propagating on a manifold XX as being (0+1)(0+1)-dimensional quantum field theory:
the fields of this system are maps Σ→X\Sigma \to X where Σ∈RiemBord 1\Sigma \in Riem Bord_1 are 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold cobordisms. These are the trajectories of the particle.
After quantization this yields a 1-dimensional FQFT given by a functor
U(−):RiemBord 1→Hilb
  U(-) : Riem Bord_1 \to Hilb


from cobordisms to Hilbert spaces (or some other flavor of vector spaces) that assigns


to the point the space of states ℋ\mathcal{H}, typically the space of L 2L_2-sections (with respect to a Riemannian metric on XX) of the background gauge field on XX under which the particle in question is charged


to the cobordism of Riemannian length tt the operator
U(t):=exp(tiℏH):ℋ→ℋ,
  U(t) := \exp\left(\frac{t}{i \hbar } H \right)
  : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
  \,,


where HH is the Hamiltonian operator, typically of the form H=∇ †∘∇H = \nabla^\dagger \circ \nabla  for ∇\nabla the covariant derivative of the given background gauge field.


Such a setup describes the quantum mechanics of a particle that feels forces of backgound gravity encoded in the Riemannian metric on XX and forces of background gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) encoded in the covariant derivative ∇\nabla.
(This is the Schrödinger picture.)
Quantum subsystems

Definition
For 𝒜\mathcal{A} an algebra describing a quantum system, def. , a subsystem is a subalgebra (a subobject) B↪𝒜B \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}.
Two subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A} are called independent subsystems if the linear map
B 1⊗B 2→𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \to \mathcal{A}

(b 1,b 2)↦b 1⋅b 2  
  (b_1, b_2) \mapsto b_1 \cdot b_2


from the tensor product of algebras (the composite system) factors as an isomorphism
B 1⊗B 2→≃B 1∨B 2↪𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B_1 \vee B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}


through the algebra B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that is generated by B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 inside 𝒜\mathcal{A} (the smallest subalgebra containing both).

See for instance (BrunettiFredenhagen, section 5.2.2).

Definition
Given two independent subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}, and two states ρ 1:B 1→ℂ\rho_1 : B_1 \to \mathbb{C} and ρ 2:B 2→ℂ\rho_2 : B_2 \to \mathbb{C}, then the corresponding product state ρ 1⊗ρ 2\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 is defined to be
(ρ 1⊗ρ 2):(b 1,b 2)↦ρ 1(b 1)ρ 2(b 2).
  (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) : 
  (b_1 , b_2) \mapsto \rho_1(b_1) \rho_2(b_2)
  \,.



Definition
There exist states on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that are not (convex combinations of) product states. This phenomenon is called entanglement.

The standard model of particle physics is a model (in particle physics): a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles currently experimentally known, containing

matter: electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other fermions,

as well as three of the four fundamental forces as currently known, which, somewhat roughly, are

force: the electroweak force (including electromagnetism) and the strong nuclear force.

It is defined as a local Lagrangian field theory which is an Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory.
The main ingredient missing from the standard model is the quantum version of the field of gravity. For decades, a large part of theoretical physics has been absorbed with attempts to understand how this last of the known fundamental forces might fit into the picture.
As a quantum field theory, the standard model is in particular a Yang–Mills gauge theory with spinors in Yang–Mills theory.
Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a quantum field theory is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model.
Gauge group
The exact gauge group of the standard model is not quite the product group
U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)


of the circle group with special unitary groups, but is the quotient group
(1)G SM=(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6
  
  G_{SM} 
  \;=\;
  \big(
    U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \big)
  / \mathbb{Z}_6


of that by a cyclic group ℤ 6⊂U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)\mathbb{Z}_6 \subset U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) which is the subgroup generated from an element of the form
(q 6,q 21 2,q 31 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3),
  (q_6, q_2 \mathbf{1}_2, q_3 \mathbf{1}_3) \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,,


where q n∈U(1)q_n \in U(1) denotes an nnth primitive root of unity, i.e.
(e 2πi16,e 2πi121 2,e 2πi131 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3).
  \left(
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{6}}
    \;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{2}} \mathbf{1}_2\;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{3}} \mathbf{1}_3
  \right) 
  \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,.


(See Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36 for a fairly comprehensive discussion. See also e.g. HMY 13, p. 2.)
Strikingly, this exact gauge group (1) of the standard model of particle physics happens to coincide with…


…the group
G SM≃S(U(2)×U(3))⊂SU(5)
   G_{SM} 
    \;\simeq\; 
   S\big(U(2) \times U(3)\big) 
    \;\subset\; 
   SU(5)


of determinant-1 elements in the direct product group U(2)×U(3)U(2) \times U(3), which makes manifest that the standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the simple Lie group SU(5).
This is the basis of “grand unified theories” (GUT), speculative extensions of the standard model trying to understand its gauge group as being a spontaneously broken simple Lie group-symmetry.


…the subgroup of the Jordan algebra automorphism group of the octonionic Albert algebra that “stabilizes a 4d sub-Minkowski spacetime” (see there for details).
More concretely, it is identified with the subgroup of Spin(9) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19, see also at SO(10)-GUT)


This is part of ongoing speculation that octonionic exceptional structures might be behind the standard model.

A field configuration of the physical theory of gravity on a spacetime XX is equivalently


a vielbein field, hence a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle along BO(n−1,1)→BGL(n)\mathbf{B} O(n-1,1) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n), defining a pseudo-Riemannian metric;


a connection that is locally a Lie algebra-valued 1-form with values in the Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω):TX→𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d-1,1)


such that this is a Cartan connection.


(This parameterization of the gravitational field is called the first-order formulation of gravity.) The component EE of the connection is the vielbein that encodes a pseudo-Riemannian metric g=E⋅Eg = E \cdot E on XX and makes XX a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Its quanta are the gravitons.
The non-propagating field? Ω\Omega is the spin connection.
The action functional on the space of such connection which defines the classical field theory of gravity is the Einstein-Hilbert action.
More generally, supergravity is a gauge theory over a supermanifold XX for the super Poincare group. The field of supergravity is a Lie-algebra valued form with values in the super Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω,Ψ):TX→𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E,\Omega, \Psi) : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)


The additional fermionic field Ψ\Psi is the gravitino field.
So the configuration space of gravity on some XX is essentially the moduli space of Riemannian metrics on XX.

weak gravity conjecture


A theory of quantum gravity (QG) is supposed to be a quantum field theory (QFT) – or something similar – that corresponds to the classical field theory of gravity, possibly by quantization.
The key technical problem with quantum gravity as a non-perturbative quantum field theory is that all known constructions of QFTs quantize fields defined on a given spacetime background, while, in contrast, the field of gravity is that spacetime.
Since even for field theories that are defined on space-time backgrounds, such as Yang-Mills theory, non-perturbative quantization is a big open problem away from toy examples (for Yang-Mills theory it has been dubbed one of the Millennium Problems, see at quantization of Yang-Mills theory) this means that non-perturbative quantum gravity is an even wider open problem.
However, the Einstein-Hilbert action that defines gravity may be expanded around any of its solutions to the Einstein equations and the resulting perturbation of the field of gravity around this background behaves, to low order, like an ordinary field on a fixed spacetime background. This allows to treat perturbative quantum gravity (pQG) as a perturbative quantum field theory, see the references below.
While the Einstein-Hilbert action (or any of its variants) that defines the dynamics of gravity makes perfect sense at low energies as the definition of an effective quantum field theory (see there for details), it is not expected to be a non-effective theory at arbitrary high energies, because it is not renormalizable: all non-renormalizable QFTs that have appeared in practice turned out to be effective QFT approximations (see there) to renormalizable UV-completions.
The idea has been explored that gravity is simply to be regarded as a classical field theory, but trying to couple such a classical field theory to a stress-energy tensor of a matter quantum field theory leads to conceptual problems that break the very foundation of what is known about theoretical physics. The technical problem is this: the equations of motion of classical Einstein gravity (Einstein's equations) assert that the Einstein tensor of the field (physics) of gravity equals the energy-momentum tensor of all other force and matter fields. Here into the energy-momentum tensor enters the expression for energy and momentum of classical matter fields. However, according to the standard model of particle physics, these matter fields are not described by classical field theory. This then is the technical problem: there is no consistent way in sight to modify Einstein's equations so as to have a quantum EM tensor in it. The simple idea of taking the expectation value of the quantum matter EM-tensor leads to all kinds of theoretical problems.
Thus, this idea seems to be very unlikely. At the same time, it is clear that present experiments cannot directly probe the effects of that supposed UV-completion of Einstein-gravity.
Approaches to a full quantization of gravity therefore roughly fall into two different strategies


One assumes that the Einstein-Hilbert action is indeed the effective QFT that approximates a “UV-completion”, a more fundamental theory valid at all energies. This is the approach taken for instance in string theory.


One assumes that by some other fact that has been overlooked, one can make sense of a non-perturbative quantization of the EH action at arbitrary energies after all. This is for instance the case in speculations that EH-gravity has a UV fixed point?.


Accordingly, there are various proposals for what quantum gravity might be, but a comprehensive theory is missing to date. This is in stark contrast to the situation for the other fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics: these are Yang-Mills fields, whose nature as QFTs is, while subtle, well understood. Indeed, the theoretical and experimental sucess of Yang-Mills theory is the main reason for the belief that QFT is the right framework for fundamental physics, and that also the field of gravity must have a description in this form.
Indeed, a model of fundamental physics where Yang-Mills fields are quantized but gravity is not is incomplete and arguably even inconsistent. Central motivating examples for this come from black hole-physics:


The study of quantum fields on the classical gravitational background of a black hole spacetime suggest that in a full theory of quantum gravity black holes could be shown to emit radiation and to eventually even decay in some way or other. This expected decay process cannot be described without a theory of quantum gravity.


Related to black hole radiation is a whole series of observations in classical general relativity that seem to indicate that black holes need to be thought of as systems possessing physical microstates with an entropy that cannot be accounted for by classical general relativity. This has led to the expectation that these microstates are states in quantum theory of gravity and that their understanding is necessary for understanding the physics of black holes.


More generally, appearances of unphysical singularities in general relativity, such as in black holes or cosmological singularities such as the big bang, have been argued to be artefacts of a non-quantum description of gravity. Various toy models of quantum gravity have been proposed where notably the big-bang singularity is just a classical approximation to a non-singular and well-defined quantum dynamics.


An evident definition of quantum gravity would seem to simply be the quantization of the Einstein-Hilbert action by the rules perturbation theory and renormalization. This straightforward approach however fails, as it can be demonstrated that this action functional is not renormalizable.
More recently it has been argued that there is evidence that the EH-action has a nontrivial UV-fixed point? after all. If true this would mean that a quantization of gravity in standard QFT is possible.
Another possibility is that this is only an apparent problem, and that standard gravity is nothing but an effective quantum field theory. (See there for references on gravity).
But most approaches to the problem have taken the non-renormalizability of classical gravity to be an indication that the standard concepts of QFT might need refinement in order to include gravity.
A common idea is that the assumption that the space of configurations in gravity is really that of smooth spacetimes, i.e. of smooth manifolds, is wrong. A plethora of variants of the notion of smooth manifold have been proposed as ingredients for a theory of quantum gravity. Notably concepts in noncommutative geometry. For instance Alain Connes‘s spectral action generalizes the Einstein-Hilbert action functional from Riemannian manifolds to spectral triples. However, none of the modifications of the spaces of configuratations of gravity proposed so far have been shown to support action functionals that can actually be quantized, in one sense or another.
Accordingly there are suggestions to modify instead the principles of perturbative quantum field theory. In string theory the fundamental assumption is that the Feynman perturbation series over 1-dimensional graphs of traditional perturbative QFT is to be refined by a similar series over 2-dimensional surfaces. It has been shown that this string perturbation series needs no renormalization and that it does describe Yang-Mills fields and a gravitational field. This led to huge hopes and large activity in the study of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity. But various central questions remain open and the state of the theory remains somewhat inconclusive.
While perturbative string theory did demonstrate that there is a variant of the perturbation series for gravity which is renormalized, it can, by definition of perturbation theory, be just an approximation to a more fundamental non-perturbatively defined theory. Various candidates for the non-perturbative theory to which the string perturbation series might be an approximation have been proposed. One that enjoyed a large popularity in the 1990s was called matrix mechanics but the high hopes connected with it were supported mostly by toy example computations. More recently the AdS/CFT correspondence is widely thought of as providing a non-perturbative definition of string theory and of quantum gravity. This correspondence asserts that observables of a string theory on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime may be matched equivalently to certain observables in an auxiliary super Yang-Mills theory. If true, this would allow to take the well understood non-perturbative definition of Yang-Mills theory and deduce from it a theory of quantum gravity.
Still another suggestion has been that ordinary quantum field theory might be seen to apply to the ordinary configuration space and action functional of general relativity, if only a suitably adapted parameterization of the configuration space is chosen. Notably one observes that Riemannian manifolds may be encoded in terms of connections on the tangent bundle – the Levi-Civita connection – this being manifestly analogous to the nature of the fields in Yang-Mills theory. (See first-order formulation of gravity).
It has been suggested that therefore quantum gravity may have a description in terms of the holonomy-observables of these connections, their parallel transport around loops. Research in this direction has therefore become known as loop quantum gravity . However, little progress has been made in understanding the configuration space of smooth connections in terms of loop observables. In most of the LQG-literature instead it is assumed from the outset that it makes sense to pass to generalized connections : while a smooth connection is the same as a smooth parallel transport-functor on the path groupoid P 1(X)→BG\mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G, the “generalized connections” in this context are taken to be non-smooth and non-continuous such functors on sub-categories of paths. It is is not clear how this configuration space relates to that of ordinary gravity.
A plethora of further suggestions has developed out of this, which in the literature often still go under the name “LQG”, even though they may abandon the description of configuration spaces of metrics in terms of loop observables. There is for instance the approach of spin foams or causal dynamical triangulations, and that of causets , to name just a few.
The problem with discriminating between all these proposals is the combination of two problems.


There exist insufficient theoretical tools for analyzing in detail the consequences of the various proposals.


There are few to no experiments available that would be able to observe the phenomena that a theory of quantum gravity is supposed to describe.


As a result, the field of fundamental physics today finds itself in a somewhat awkward position where the need for theoretical progress concerning quantum gravity for conceptual reasons is widely appreciated, but where disagreements about the viability of various proposals finds no conclusive resolution and divides the community.
While classical mechanics considers deterministic evolution of particles and fields, quantum physics follows nondeterministic evolution where the probability of various outcomes of measurement may be predicted from the state in a Hilbert space representing the possible reality: that state undergoes a unitary evolution, what means that the generator of the evolution is −1\sqrt{-1} times a Hermitean operator called the quantum Hamiltonian or the Hamiltonian operator of the system. The theoretical framework for describing this precisely is the quantum mechanics. It involves a constant of nature, Planck constant hh; some quantum systems with spatial interpretation in the limit h→0h\to 0 lead to classical mechanical systems (not all: some phenomena including non-integer spin are purely quantum mechanical, but the properties depending on their existence survive in the “classical” limit); in limited generality, one can motivate and find the nonfunctorial procedure to single out a right inverse to taking this classical limit under the name quantization.
While quantum mechanics may be formulated for a wide range of physical systems, interpreted as particles, extended particles and fields, the quantum mechanics of fields is often called the quantum field theory and the quantum mechanics of systems of a fixed finite number of particles is often viewed as the quantum mechanics in a narrow sense.

Mathematically, despite the basic formalism of quantum mechanics which is sound and clear, there are two big areas which are yet not clear. One is to understand quantization, in all cases – of particles, fields, strings and so on. The second and possibly more central to nLab is a problem how to define rigorously a wide range of quantum field theories and some related quantum mechanical systems like the hypothetical superstring theory. Regarding that this is a central goal, we also put emphasis on the interpretation of quantum mechanics via the picture which is a special case of a FQFT, and where the time evolution functorially leads to evolution operators.
We discuss some basic notions of quantum mechanics.

Recall the notion of a classical mechanical system: the formal dual of a real commutative Poisson algebra.

A quantum mechanical system is a star algebra (A,(−) *)(A, (-)^\ast) over the complex numbers. The category of of quantum mechanical systems is the opposite category of *\ast-algebras:
QuantMechSys:=*Alg ℂ op.
  QuantMechSys := {\ast}Alg_{\mathbb{C}}^{op}
  \,.



Remark
It makes sense to think of this as a deformed version of a real Poisson algebra as follows:


the Poisson-Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra corresponds to the commutator of the *\ast-algebra:
[a,b]:=ab−ba,
  [a,b] := a b - b a
  \,,



the commutative algebra structure of the Poisson algebra coresponds to the Jordan algebra structure of the *\ast-algebra, with commutative (but non-associative!) product
(a,b):=ab+ba.
  (a,b) := a b + b a
  \,.



With this interpretation the derivation-property of the Poisson bracket over the other product is preserved: for all a,b,c∈Aa,b,c \in A we have
[a,(b,c)]=([a,b],c)+(b,[a,c]).
  [a,(b,c)] = ([a,b],c) + (b,[a,c])
  \,.


We thus may regard a non-commutative star-algebra as a non-associative Poisson algebra : a Jordan-Lie algebra. See there for more details.

Observables and states

Definition
Given a quantum mechanical system in terms of a star algebra AA, we say


an observable is an element a∈Aa \in A such that a *=aa^\ast = a;


a state is a linear function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is positive in the sense that for all a∈Aa \in A we have ρ(aa *)≥0∈ℝ↪ℂ\rho(a a^\ast) \geq 0 \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}.




Remark
One can formalize the idea that a quantum mechanical system is like a deformed classical mechanical system as follows:
To every  *{}^\ast-algebra AA is associated its poset of commutative subalgebras Com(A)Com(A). Then the corresponding quantum mechanical system is a classical mechanical system internal to the sheaf topos Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)):


The *\ast-algebra canonically induces a commuative algebra A̲∈Sh(Com(A))\underline A \in Sh(Com(A));


the (classical) states of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) are in natural bijection with the quantum states externally on AA;


the (classical) observables of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) correspond to the external quantum observables on AA.


(…details…)

One also says that the internal classical mechanical system (Sh(Com(A)),A̲)(Sh(Com(A)), \underline{A}) is the “Bohrification” of the external quantum system AA. See there for more details.
Spaces of states
Given a *\ast-algebra AA together with a state ρ\rho on it, the GNS construction provides an inner product space H ρH_\rho together with an action of AA on H ρH_\rho and a vector Ω=(ρ)\Omega = \sqrt(\rho) – the vacuum vector? – such that for all a∈Aa \in A the value of the state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} is obtained by applying aa to ρ\sqrt{\rho} and then taking the inner product with ρ\sqrt \rho:
ρ(A)=⟨ρ,aρ⟩.
  \rho(A) = \langle \sqrt\rho, a \sqrt \rho\rangle
  \,.


If the star algebra AA happens to be a C-star algebra, then this inner product space is naturally a Hilbert space.
Historically and still often in the literature, such a Hilbert space is taken as a fundamental input of the definition of quantum systems.
Traditionally, Dirac‘s “bra-ket” notation is used to represent vectors in such Hilbert spaces of states, where |ψ⟩|\psi\rangle represents a state and ⟨ψ|\langle\psi| represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.
In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators ρ\rho, state evolution as maps of the form ρ↦U †ρU\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U for unitary maps UU, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM’s). There is a natural embedding of pure states into the space of density matrices: |ψ⟩↦|ψ⟩⟨ψ||\psi\rangle \mapsto |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|. So, one way to think of mixed states is a probabilistic mixture of pure states.
ρ=∑ ia i|ψ i⟩⟨ψ i| \rho = \sum_i a_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| 
Composite systems are formed by taking the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. If a pure state |Ψ⟩∈H 1⊗H 2|\Psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2 can be written as |ψ 1⟩⊗|ψ 2⟩|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle for |ψ i⟩∈H i|\psi_i\rangle \in H_i it is said to be separable. If no such |ψ i⟩|\psi_i\rangle exist, |Ψ⟩|\Psi\rangle is said to be entangled. If a mixed state is separable if it is the sum of separable pure states. Otherwise, it is entangled.
Flows and time evolution
As for classical mechanics, 1-parameter families of flows in a quantum mechanical system are induced from observables a∈Aa \in A by
ddλb λ=1iℏ[b λ,a].
  \frac{d}{d \lambda} b_\lambda = \frac{1}{i \hbar}[b_\lambda, a]
  \,.


In a non-relativistic system one specifies an observable HH – called the Hamiltonian – whose flow represents the time evolution of the system. (This is the Heisenberg picture.)
We comment on how to interpret this from the point of view of FQFT:
Quantum mechanics of point particles may be understood as a special case of the formalism of quantum field theory. It is interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical mechanics of point particles. Of course, we can take a configuration space of a system of particles looking like the configuration space of a single particle in a higher dimensional manifold.
Remark: related query on the relation between QFT and quantum mechanics (of particles and in general) can be found here.
One may usefully think of the quantum mechanics of a point particle propagating on a manifold XX as being (0+1)(0+1)-dimensional quantum field theory:
the fields of this system are maps Σ→X\Sigma \to X where Σ∈RiemBord 1\Sigma \in Riem Bord_1 are 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold cobordisms. These are the trajectories of the particle.
After quantization this yields a 1-dimensional FQFT given by a functor
U(−):RiemBord 1→Hilb
  U(-) : Riem Bord_1 \to Hilb


from cobordisms to Hilbert spaces (or some other flavor of vector spaces) that assigns


to the point the space of states ℋ\mathcal{H}, typically the space of L 2L_2-sections (with respect to a Riemannian metric on XX) of the background gauge field on XX under which the particle in question is charged


to the cobordism of Riemannian length tt the operator
U(t):=exp(tiℏH):ℋ→ℋ,
  U(t) := \exp\left(\frac{t}{i \hbar } H \right)
  : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
  \,,


where HH is the Hamiltonian operator, typically of the form H=∇ †∘∇H = \nabla^\dagger \circ \nabla  for ∇\nabla the covariant derivative of the given background gauge field.


Such a setup describes the quantum mechanics of a particle that feels forces of backgound gravity encoded in the Riemannian metric on XX and forces of background gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) encoded in the covariant derivative ∇\nabla.
(This is the Schrödinger picture.)
Quantum subsystems

Definition
For 𝒜\mathcal{A} an algebra describing a quantum system, def. , a subsystem is a subalgebra (a subobject) B↪𝒜B \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}.
Two subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A} are called independent subsystems if the linear map
B 1⊗B 2→𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \to \mathcal{A}

(b 1,b 2)↦b 1⋅b 2  
  (b_1, b_2) \mapsto b_1 \cdot b_2


from the tensor product of algebras (the composite system) factors as an isomorphism
B 1⊗B 2→≃B 1∨B 2↪𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B_1 \vee B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}


through the algebra B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that is generated by B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 inside 𝒜\mathcal{A} (the smallest subalgebra containing both).

See for instance (BrunettiFredenhagen, section 5.2.2).

Definition
Given two independent subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}, and two states ρ 1:B 1→ℂ\rho_1 : B_1 \to \mathbb{C} and ρ 2:B 2→ℂ\rho_2 : B_2 \to \mathbb{C}, then the corresponding product state ρ 1⊗ρ 2\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 is defined to be
(ρ 1⊗ρ 2):(b 1,b 2)↦ρ 1(b 1)ρ 2(b 2).
  (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) : 
  (b_1 , b_2) \mapsto \rho_1(b_1) \rho_2(b_2)
  \,.



Definition
There exist states on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that are not (convex combinations of) product states. This phenomenon is called entanglement.

A state of a system in physics is a description of everything that is true (or known, or relevant, depending on the circumstances) about the physical system.
In the Bayesian interpretation of physics, the state of a system is not a property of reality but instead indicates an observer's knowledge about the system. A pure state gives maximal information about the system (which amounts to complete information in classical mechanics but not generally in quantum mechanics), while a mixed state is more general. A mixed state can be decomposed into a probability distribution on the space of pure states, although this decomposition is unique only for classical systems. In a frequentist interpretation of probability, a mixed state can describe only a statistical ensemble of systems; the real world is in one (generally unknown) pure state (possibly with additional hidden variables in the quantum case, depending on the interpretation of quantum physics).
States in the Schrödinger picture describe the state of the system at any given time and are subject to time evolution?, while in the Heisenberg picture a single state describes the entire history of the system (with time evolution applying to the observables instead).
In statistical physics, a microstate? is a complete description of all of the particles in a system, while a macrostate? considers only the macroscopic properties known to thermodynamics.
In a sigma-model quantum field theory a field history is a morphism ϕ:Σ→X\phi \colon \Sigma \to X for Σ\Sigma an nn-dimensional manifold or similar. One is to think of this as being the trajectory: of an (n−1)(n-1)-brane propagating in the target space XX.
For the case n=1n = 1 (for instance the relativistic particle, a 0-brane) the term worldline for Σ\Sigma has a long tradition. Accordingly one calls Σ\Sigma the worldvolume of the given (n−1)(n-1)-brane when n>1n \gt 1. For the case n=2n=2 (the case of relevance in string theory) one also says worldsheet.
Hence generally for any field theory defined on a worldvolume or spacetime Σ\Sigma, and with type of fields determined by a field bundle E→fbΣE \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma, one may think of a section of the field bundle as a field trajectory.
The space of all these is the space of trajectories (space of histories).
Dynamics affects both observables and, dually, states; this is most well known in quantum mechanics but applies equally well to classical mechanics. The different “pictures” of mechanics differ in how the dynamics is explicitly formalized:


In the Heisenberg picture, the dependence of observables on time (or more generally spacetime) is encoded, while the state is held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by the Haag–Kastler axioms of AQFT.


In the Schrödinger picture, states are propagated through time, while observables are held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by cobordism category representations in FQFT.


The Dirac (interaction) picture is a mixture of these two approaches: dynamics is split into a free? (or otherwise solvable?) part and an interaction or perturbation; one of these is take to affect the states, the other the observables.


The pictures are named after those physicists (Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and Paul Dirac) who first used or popularised these approaches to quantum physics.
Historically, the terms ‘Schrödinger picture’ and ‘Heisenberg picture’ (at least) referred to more than what we discuss above; they referred to the entirety of the differences between Schrödinger's and Heisenberg's approaches to quantum mechanics.
For example, these terms included also Schrödinger's use of typically wave-like functions as pure states (and correspondingly operators in the higher-type-theoretic sense as observables) vs Heisenberg's use of infinite-dimensional matrices as observables (and correspondingly infinite sequences as pure states). This difference was rectified by von Neumann's application of Hilbert space to the problem, showing that (if one suitably restricts the allowed functions and sequences and also identifies equivalent functions a bit) both approaches used Hilbert space (what we would now call the infinite-dimensional iseparable Hilbert space) as the space of pure states.
This is entirely separate from the question of whether states or observables are taken to evolve with time. Still, there is this connection: Schrödinger evolved states, and his approach was called ‘wave mechanics’ after his representation for states, while Heisenberg evolved observables, and his approach was called ‘matrix mechanics’ after his representation for observables.
Central aspects of quantum mechanics with finite-dimensional spaces of quantum states — such as tensor products of qbit states of relevance in quantum information theory and quantum computation — follow from the formal properties of the category FinHilb of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. These properties are axiomatized by saying that FinHilb is an example of a †-compact category.
Conversely, much of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics and quantum computation can be formulated in any †-compact category, and general reasoning about †-compact categories themselves yields results about quantum mechanics and quantum computation.
A transparent string diagram calculus in †-compact categories as exposed in (Coecke, Kindergarten quantum mechanics) provides an intuitive and powerful tool for reasoning in †\dagger-compact categories.
Algebraically
A spectral triple (Connes-Moscovici 95) is operator algebraic data that mimics the geometric data provided by a smooth Riemannian manifold XX with spin structure (Connes 08) and generalizes it to noncommutative geometry. It is effectively a Fredholm module with possibly unbounded Fredholm operator and refined by the specification of a dense subalgebra of the C-star-algebra of bounded operators on that module. As such, spectral triples have close ties to algebraic K-theory and so also to the physics described by these (see also at spectral action).
In a little more detail, a spectral triple consists of


a ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded Hilbert space ℋ\mathcal{H}, to be thought of as the space of (square integrable) sections of the spinor bundle of XX;


An associative algebra AA with a dense embedding A↪B(H)A \hookrightarrow B(H) into the C-star-algebra of bounded operators on HH, to be thought of as the algebra of smooth functions on XX;
These two items encode the topology and smooth structure.


A Fredholm operator DD acting on ℋ\mathcal{H} and satisfying some conditions, to be thought of as the Dirac operator acting on the spinors.
This item encodes the Riemannian metric and possibly a connection.


(This is, or is a slight variant of, the concept of an unbounded Fredholm modules (e.g. Carey-Philips 98))
Below we discuss how one may think of a spectral triple as being precisely the algebraic data of supersymmetric quantum mechanics defining the worldvolume QFT of the quantum super particle propagating on a Riemannian target space (a sigma-model.) Accordingly this is just the beginning of a pattern. One degree up a 2-spectral triple is algebraic data encoding a Riemannian manifold with string structure.
As 1-dimensional FQFTs
Here is an unorthodox way to state the idea of spectral triple in terms of FQFT, which is in part just the reformulation of the quantum mechanics motivation that Alain Connes derived his definition from in the modern light of FQFT, but which more concretely follows work by Kontsevich-Soibelman, see (Soibelman 11) and see the references at 2-spectral triple.

(but maybe eventually we should have a traditional idea section and move this here to a subsection on further interpretations)

Let RCob 1|1 FeynR Cob_{1|1}^{Feyn} be the cobordism category of Feynman graphs for the superparticle with a single type of interaction along the lines of (1,1)-dimensional Euclidean field theories and K-theory. So its morphisms are generated from (1|1)(1|1)-dimensional super-Riemannian manifolds (i.e. super-intervals) and from a single interaction vertex

subject to the obvious associativity condition.
Then a spectral triple (A,H,D)(A,H,D) is the data encoding a sufficiently nice smooth functor
Z (A,H,D):RCob 1|1 Feyn→sVect
  Z_{(A,H,D)} : R Cob_{1|1}^{Feyn}  \to sVect


to the category of super vector spaces.
Here


A=Z (A,H,D)(•) 0A = Z_{(A,H,D)}(\bullet)_0 is the even part of the super vector space assigned by the functor to the point, equipped with the structure of a algebra whose product is given by the image of the interaction vertex

HH is some completion of Z (A,H,D)(•)Z_{(A,H,D)}(\bullet) to a super Hilbert space


and D∈End(H)D \in End(H) is an odd self-adjoint operator on HH, which gives the value of the functor on the super-interval (t,θ)(t,\theta) by
(t,θ)↦exp(−tD 2+θD).
  (t,\theta) \mapsto \exp( - t D^2 + \theta D )
  \,.



(For technical details that I am glossing over see the field theory link above).
So this is the quantum mechanics of a superparticle. In the simplest case this comes from a spinor particle propagating on a spin structure Riemannian manifold XXin which case


H=L 2(S)H = L^2(S) is the space of square integrable spinor sections;


DD is the Dirac operator


A=C ∞(X)A = C^\infty(X) is the space of smooth functions on XX.


One point of a spectral triple is to take the view of world-line quantum mechanics as basic and characterize the spin Riemannian geometry of XX entirely by this algebraic data. In particular the Riemannian metric on XX is encoded in the operator spectrum of DD, which is where the notion “spectral triple” gets its name from.
Then with all the ordinary geoemtry re-encoded algebraically this way, in terms of the 1-dimensional quantum field theory that probes this geometry, one can then use the same formulas to interpret spectral triple geometrically that do not come from an ordinary geometry as in the above example.
Metric dimension and KO-dimension
For a space described by a spectral triple there are several notions of dimension which all coincide when the space is a classical smooth manifold but which may differ on more general spectral spaces.
Notably there is the metric dimension?, which determines the growth of the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator (Connes95, p. 6).
And then there is the KO-dimension.

And then there is the KO-dimension.
While classical mechanics considers deterministic evolution of particles and fields, quantum physics follows nondeterministic evolution where the probability of various outcomes of measurement may be predicted from the state in a Hilbert space representing the possible reality: that state undergoes a unitary evolution, what means that the generator of the evolution is −1\sqrt{-1} times a Hermitean operator called the quantum Hamiltonian or the Hamiltonian operator of the system. The theoretical framework for describing this precisely is the quantum mechanics. It involves a constant of nature, Planck constant hh; some quantum systems with spatial interpretation in the limit h→0h\to 0 lead to classical mechanical systems (not all: some phenomena including non-integer spin are purely quantum mechanical, but the properties depending on their existence survive in the “classical” limit); in limited generality, one can motivate and find the nonfunctorial procedure to single out a right inverse to taking this classical limit under the name quantization.
While quantum mechanics may be formulated for a wide range of physical systems, interpreted as particles, extended particles and fields, the quantum mechanics of fields is often called the quantum field theory and the quantum mechanics of systems of a fixed finite number of particles is often viewed as the quantum mechanics in a narrow sense.
nPOV
Mathematically, despite the basic formalism of quantum mechanics which is sound and clear, there are two big areas which are yet not clear. One is to understand quantization, in all cases – of particles, fields, strings and so on. The second and possibly more central to nLab is a problem how to define rigorously a wide range of quantum field theories and some related quantum mechanical systems like the hypothetical superstring theory. Regarding that this is a central goal, we also put emphasis on the interpretation of quantum mechanics via the picture which is a special case of a FQFT, and where the time evolution functorially leads to evolution operators.
We discuss some basic notions of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanical systems
Recall the notion of a classical mechanical system: the formal dual of a real commutative Poisson algebra.

Definition
A quantum mechanical system is a star algebra (A,(−) *)(A, (-)^\ast) over the complex numbers. The category of of quantum mechanical systems is the opposite category of *\ast-algebras:
QuantMechSys:=*Alg ℂ op.
  QuantMechSys := {\ast}Alg_{\mathbb{C}}^{op}
  \,.



Remark
It makes sense to think of this as a deformed version of a real Poisson algebra as follows:


the Poisson-Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra corresponds to the commutator of the *\ast-algebra:
[a,b]:=ab−ba,
  [a,b] := a b - b a
  \,,



the commutative algebra structure of the Poisson algebra coresponds to the Jordan algebra structure of the *\ast-algebra, with commutative (but non-associative!) product
(a,b):=ab+ba.
  (a,b) := a b + b a
  \,.



With this interpretation the derivation-property of the Poisson bracket over the other product is preserved: for all a,b,c∈Aa,b,c \in A we have
[a,(b,c)]=([a,b],c)+(b,[a,c]).
  [a,(b,c)] = ([a,b],c) + (b,[a,c])
  \,.


We thus may regard a non-commutative star-algebra as a non-associative Poisson algebra : a Jordan-Lie algebra. See there for more details.

Observables and states

Definition
Given a quantum mechanical system in terms of a star algebra AA, we say


an observable is an element a∈Aa \in A such that a *=aa^\ast = a;


a state is a linear function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is positive in the sense that for all a∈Aa \in A we have ρ(aa *)≥0∈ℝ↪ℂ\rho(a a^\ast) \geq 0 \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}.




Remark
One can formalize the idea that a quantum mechanical system is like a deformed classical mechanical system as follows:
To every  *{}^\ast-algebra AA is associated its poset of commutative subalgebras Com(A)Com(A). Then the corresponding quantum mechanical system is a classical mechanical system internal to the sheaf topos Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)):


The *\ast-algebra canonically induces a commuative algebra A̲∈Sh(Com(A))\underline A \in Sh(Com(A));


the (classical) states of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) are in natural bijection with the quantum states externally on AA;


the (classical) observables of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) correspond to the external quantum observables on AA.


(…details…)

One also says that the internal classical mechanical system (Sh(Com(A)),A̲)(Sh(Com(A)), \underline{A}) is the “Bohrification” of the external quantum system AA. See there for more details.
Spaces of states
Given a *\ast-algebra AA together with a state ρ\rho on it, the GNS construction provides an inner product space H ρH_\rho together with an action of AA on H ρH_\rho and a vector Ω=(ρ)\Omega = \sqrt(\rho) – the vacuum vector? – such that for all a∈Aa \in A the value of the state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} is obtained by applying aa to ρ\sqrt{\rho} and then taking the inner product with ρ\sqrt \rho:
ρ(A)=⟨ρ,aρ⟩.
  \rho(A) = \langle \sqrt\rho, a \sqrt \rho\rangle
  \,.


If the star algebra AA happens to be a C-star algebra, then this inner product space is naturally a Hilbert space.
Historically and still often in the literature, such a Hilbert space is taken as a fundamental input of the definition of quantum systems.
Traditionally, Dirac‘s “bra-ket” notation is used to represent vectors in such Hilbert spaces of states, where |ψ⟩|\psi\rangle represents a state and ⟨ψ|\langle\psi| represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.
In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators ρ\rho, state evolution as maps of the form ρ↦U †ρU\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U for unitary maps UU, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM’s). There is a natural embedding of pure states into the space of density matrices: |ψ⟩↦|ψ⟩⟨ψ||\psi\rangle \mapsto |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|. So, one way to think of mixed states is a probabilistic mixture of pure states.
ρ=∑ ia i|ψ i⟩⟨ψ i| \rho = \sum_i a_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| 
Composite systems are formed by taking the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. If a pure state |Ψ⟩∈H 1⊗H 2|\Psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2 can be written as |ψ 1⟩⊗|ψ 2⟩|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle for |ψ i⟩∈H i|\psi_i\rangle \in H_i it is said to be separable. If no such |ψ i⟩|\psi_i\rangle exist, |Ψ⟩|\Psi\rangle is said to be entangled. If a mixed state is separable if it is the sum of separable pure states. Otherwise, it is entangled.
Flows and time evolution
As for classical mechanics, 1-parameter families of flows in a quantum mechanical system are induced from observables a∈Aa \in A by
ddλb λ=1iℏ[b λ,a].
  \frac{d}{d \lambda} b_\lambda = \frac{1}{i \hbar}[b_\lambda, a]
  \,.


In a non-relativistic system one specifies an observable HH – called the Hamiltonian – whose flow represents the time evolution of the system. (This is the Heisenberg picture.)
We comment on how to interpret this from the point of view of FQFT:
Quantum mechanics of point particles may be understood as a special case of the formalism of quantum field theory. It is interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical mechanics of point particles. Of course, we can take a configuration space of a system of particles looking like the configuration space of a single particle in a higher dimensional manifold.
Remark: related query on the relation between QFT and quantum mechanics (of particles and in general) can be found here.
One may usefully think of the quantum mechanics of a point particle propagating on a manifold XX as being (0+1)(0+1)-dimensional quantum field theory:
the fields of this system are maps Σ→X\Sigma \to X where Σ∈RiemBord 1\Sigma \in Riem Bord_1 are 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold cobordisms. These are the trajectories of the particle.
After quantization this yields a 1-dimensional FQFT given by a functor
U(−):RiemBord 1→Hilb
  U(-) : Riem Bord_1 \to Hilb


from cobordisms to Hilbert spaces (or some other flavor of vector spaces) that assigns


to the point the space of states ℋ\mathcal{H}, typically the space of L 2L_2-sections (with respect to a Riemannian metric on XX) of the background gauge field on XX under which the particle in question is charged


to the cobordism of Riemannian length tt the operator
U(t):=exp(tiℏH):ℋ→ℋ,
  U(t) := \exp\left(\frac{t}{i \hbar } H \right)
  : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
  \,,


where HH is the Hamiltonian operator, typically of the form H=∇ †∘∇H = \nabla^\dagger \circ \nabla  for ∇\nabla the covariant derivative of the given background gauge field.


Such a setup describes the quantum mechanics of a particle that feels forces of backgound gravity encoded in the Riemannian metric on XX and forces of background gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) encoded in the covariant derivative ∇\nabla.
(This is the Schrödinger picture.)
Quantum subsystems

Definition
For 𝒜\mathcal{A} an algebra describing a quantum system, def. , a subsystem is a subalgebra (a subobject) B↪𝒜B \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}.
Two subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A} are called independent subsystems if the linear map
B 1⊗B 2→𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \to \mathcal{A}

(b 1,b 2)↦b 1⋅b 2  
  (b_1, b_2) \mapsto b_1 \cdot b_2


from the tensor product of algebras (the composite system) factors as an isomorphism
B 1⊗B 2→≃B 1∨B 2↪𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B_1 \vee B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}


through the algebra B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that is generated by B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 inside 𝒜\mathcal{A} (the smallest subalgebra containing both).

See for instance (BrunettiFredenhagen, section 5.2.2).

Definition
Given two independent subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}, and two states ρ 1:B 1→ℂ\rho_1 : B_1 \to \mathbb{C} and ρ 2:B 2→ℂ\rho_2 : B_2 \to \mathbb{C}, then the corresponding product state ρ 1⊗ρ 2\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 is defined to be
(ρ 1⊗ρ 2):(b 1,b 2)↦ρ 1(b 1)ρ 2(b 2).
  (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) : 
  (b_1 , b_2) \mapsto \rho_1(b_1) \rho_2(b_2)
  \,.



Definition
There exist states on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that are not (convex combinations of) product states. This phenomenon is called entanglement.

An ordinary spectral triple is, as discussed there, the abstract algebraic data characterizing supersymmetric quantum mechanics on a worldline and thereby spectrally encoding an effective (possibly non-commutative, hence “non-geometric”) target space geometry. Ordinary Riemannian geometry with spin structure is the special case of this where the Hilbert space in the spectral triple is that of square integrable sections of the spinor bundle on a spin Riemannian manifold and the operator DD acting on that is the standard Dirac operator, hence the “supercharge” of the worldline supersymmetry of the spinning particle.
In generalization of this, a “2-spectral triple” should be the analogous algebraic data that encodes the worldsheet theory of a superstring propagating on a target space geometry which is a generalization of Riemannian geometry with (twisted) string structure.
Of course such data is just that of a 2d superconformal field theory, realized locally by, for instance, a vertex operator algebra or by a conformal net of local observables. But for emphasis it may be useful to speak of such data as constituting a “2-spectral triple”, for emphasizing more the important and intricate relation to the concept of spectral triples, which in much of the literature seems to be unduly ignored.

That the 0-mode sector of a 2d SCFT – hence the quantum point particle limit of a quantum superstring dynamics – yields a spectral triple was maybe first highlighted in (Fröhlich-Gawędzki 93) by way of a series of concrete examples, such as the WZW model.
Here the role of the Dirac operator of the spectral triple is played by the Dirac-Ramond operator of the superstring, hence the operator whose index (in the large volume limit) is the Witten genus.
That hence the superstring quantum theory should be regarded as a kind of higher spectral triple was maybe first suggested in (Chamseddine 97), together with arguments that the associated spectral action indeed reproduces the action functional of the string’s target space effective supergravity theory. An exposition of this perspective is in (Fröhlich-Grandjean-Recknagel 97, section 7.2).
From Fröhlich 92, p. 11:

I still have hopes, perhaps romantic ones, that string theory, or something inspired by it, will come back to life again. I believe it is interesting to attempt to formulate string theory in an “invariant” way, quite like it is useful to formulate geometry in a coordinate-independent way. One might, for example, start with a family ℱ\mathcal{F}, of hyperfinite type

 von Neumann algebras – to be a little technical – indexed by intervals of the circle with non-empty complement (or of the super-circle). It may pay to formulate the starting point using the language of sheaves. [...][...] This structure determines a braided monoidal C*-category with unit, …; briefly, a quantum theory. From a combination of such tensor categories (left and right movers) one would attempt to reconstruct (symmetries of) physical space-time. String amplitudes would correspond to arrows (intertwiners) of the tensor category. [...][...] it would provide a general way of thinking about string theory that does not presuppose knowing the target space-time of the theory.

Later it was shown more formally (Roggenkamp-Wendland 03), reviewed in (Roggenkamp-Wendland 08), that there is a precise algebraically formalization of taking the “point particle limit” of a quantum string, by sending its vertex operator algebra to a spectral triple obtained by suitably retaining only worldsheet 0-modes.
In (Soibelman 11) this was used as a means to systematically study the large volume limit of effective string spacetimes (and hence aspects of the landscape of string theory vacua) by studying the spectral geometries (i.e. the Connes-style noncommutative geometries) of the spectral triples arising from the string’s point particle limit this way.
Now, since there is information lost in passing from a stringy “2-spectral triple” (a 2d SCFT) to its underlying point particle spectral triple, not all spectral triples are to be expected to have a lift to a 2-spectral triple (possibly corresponding to a UV-completion of the corresponding target space effective field theories).
In view of this, it is noteworthy that the spectral triple of the Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model shares a few key properties with the 2d SCFTs considered in string phenomenology:
The Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model is an encoding in a spectral triple of the standard model of particle physics coupled to gravity realized as a kind of spectral Kaluza-Klein compactification on a non-commutative fiber space down to ordinary 4d Minkowski spacetime (or possibly its Wick rotated Euclidean version). In order for this to work out, it turns out that the compactified non-commutative fiber space needs to have KO-dimension equal to 66. (Here the fiber space is classically just a (“non-commutative”) point, but it appears as the singular collapsing limit of a space of finite dimension. This actual dimension is the KO-dimension.)
Hence the claim of the Connes-Lott-Chamseddine model is that if the standard model of particle physics is encoded as a singular limit of a Kaluza-Klein compactification modeled via a spectral triple then the dimensions of the KK-compactification are
4+6(mod8)
  4 + 6 \;\;\; (mod\;8)


with 4-dimensional base space and 6-dimensional fiber space, to a total of a 10-dimensional spacetime at high energy (after uncompactification of the fiber).
This, of course, is precisely the dimensionality of the target spacetime of perturbative string theory vacua for the critical superstring.
This point was highlighted in Connes 06, p. 8:

 When one looks at the table (7.2) of Appendix 7 giving the KO-dimension of the finite space [[ i.e. the noncommutative KK-compactification-fiber FF ]] one then finds that its KO-dimension is now equal to 6 modulo 8 (!). As a result we see that the KO-dimension of the product space M×FM \times F [[ i.e. of 4d spacetime MM with the noncommutative KK-compactification-fiber FF]] is in fact equal to 10∼210  \sim 2 modulo 8. Of course the above 10 is very reminiscent of string theory, in which the finite space FF might bea good candidate for an “effective” compactification at least for low energies. But 10 is also 2 modulo 8 which might be related to the observations of Lauscher-Reuter 06 about gravity.

Algebraically, this arises from the fact that the BRST complex for the superstring worldsheet theory is consistent (has BRST differential squaring to 0) precisely if the corresponding 2d SCFT has conformal central charge 15, and each spacetime dimension contributes 1121 \tfrac{1}{2} to this central charge (a contribution of 1 from each bosonic direction, and another 12\tfrac{1}{2} for the corresponding fermionic contribution).
A string or 1-brane is a brane of dimension one higher than an ordinary particle:
where a 1-dimensional sigma-model may be thought of a describing the dynamics of particles propagating of a target space XX, a 2-dimensional sigma-model is said to described the dynamics of a string on some target space.
Much of traditional quantum field theory on XX may be understood in terms of second quantization of 1-dimensional sigma-models with target space XX. What is called string theory is the corresponding study of what happens to this situation as the 1-dimensional σ\sigma-model is replaced by a 2-dimensional one (for more on this see at worldline formalism).
A key motivation/application for strings is their identification with flux tubes in confined Yang-Mills theory/QCD [Polyakov (1998), Polyakov (1999)], for more on this see at AdS-CFT correspondence and AdS-QCD correspondence.

A σ\sigma-model is a particular kind of physical theory of certain fields. The basic data describing a specific σ\sigma-model is some kind of “space” XX, in a category of “spaces” which includes smooth manifolds. We call XX the target space, and we define the “configuration space of fields” Conf ΣConf_\Sigma over a manifold Σ\Sigma to be the mapping space/mapping stack Map(Σ,X)Map(\Sigma, X). That is, a “configuration of fields” over a manifold Σ\Sigma is like an XX-valued function on Σ\Sigma.
We assign a dimension n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} to our σ\sigma-model, take dimΣ≤ndim \Sigma \leq n and assume that target space XX is equipped with a “circle n-bundle with connection”.
For n=1n = 1 this is an ordinary circle bundle with connection and models a configuration of the electromagnetic field on XX. To distinguish this “field” on XX from the fields on Σ\Sigma we speak of a background gauge field. (This remains fixed background data unless and until we pass to second quantization.) A field configuration Σ→X\Sigma \to X on Σ\Sigma models a trajectory of a charged particle subject to the forces exerted by this background field.
For n=2n = 2, a circle nn-bundle with connection is a circle 2-group principal 2-bundle or equivalently a bundle gerbe with connection. This models a “higher electromagnetic field”, called a Kalb-Ramond field. Now Σ\Sigma is taken to be 2-dimensional and a map Σ→X\Sigma \to X models the trajectory of a string on XX, subject to forces exerted on it by this higher order field.
This pattern continues. In the next dimension a membrane with 3-dimensional worldvolume is charged under a circle 3-bundle with connection, for instance something called the supergravity C-field.
While one can speak of higher bundles in full generality and full analogy to ordinary principal bundles, it is useful to observe that any circle nn-bundle is characterized by a classifying map α:X→B nU(1)\alpha : X \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1) in our category of spaces, so we can just think about classifying maps instead. Here U(1)U(1) is the circle group, and B n\mathbf{B}^n denotes its nnth delooping ; thus such a map is also a sort of cocycle in “smooth nnth cohomology of XX with coefficients in U(1)U(1)”. The additional data of a connection refines this to a cocycle in the differential cohomology of XX.
Such connection data ∇\nabla on a circle nn-bundle defines – and is defined by – a notion of higher parallel transport over nn-dimensional trajectories: for closed nn-dimensional Σ\Sigma it defines a map hol:(γ:Σ→X)↦exp(i∫ Σγ *∇)∈U(1)hol : (\gamma : \Sigma \to X) \mapsto \exp(i \int_\Sigma \gamma^*\nabla) \in U(1) that sends trajectories to elements in U(1)U(1): the holonomy of ∇\nabla over Σ\Sigma, given by integration of local data over Σ\Sigma. The local data being integrated is called the Lagrangian of the σ\sigma-model. Its integral is called the action functional.
In the quantum σ\sigma-model one considers in turn the integral of the action functional over all of configuration space: the “path integral”. In the classical σ\sigma-model one considers only the critical locus of the action functional (where the rough idea is that the path integral to some approximation localizes around the critical locus). Points in this critical locus are said to be configurations that satisfy the “Euler-Lagrange equations of motion”. These are supposed to be the physically realized trajectories among all of them, in the classical approximation.
Finally, just like an ordinary circle group-principal bundle has an associated vector bundle once we fix a representation of U(1)U(1) to be the fibers, any “circle n-bundle” has an associated “n-vector bundle” once we fix a “∞-representation” ρ:B nU(1)→nVect\rho : \mathbf{B}^n U(1) \to n Vect on “n-vector spaces”. Just as for the ordinary U(1)U(1), here we usually pick the canonical 1-dimensional such “representation”. Finally, we define bundles V Σ:Conf Σ→𝒞V_\Sigma : Conf_\Sigma \to \mathcal{C} of “internal states” by transgression of these associated bundles.
The passage from principal ∞-bundles to associated ∞-bundles is necessary for the description of the quantum σ\sigma-model: it assigns in positive codimension spaces of sections of these associated bundles. For a 1-categorical description of the resulting QFT ordinary vector bundles (assigned in codimension 1) would suffice, but the σ\sigma-model should determine much more: an extended quantum field theory. This requires sections of higher vector bundles. For instance for n=2n = 2 some boundary conditions of the σ\sigma-model are given by sections of the background 2-vector bundle: these are the twisted vector bundles known as the Chan-Paton bundles on the boundary-D-branes of the string. (…)
We now try to fill this with life by spelling out some standard examples. Further below we look at precise formalizations of the situation.
The Reshetikhin-Turaev construction is the FQFT construction of a 3d TQFT from the data of a modular tensor category 𝒞\mathcal{C}. It is something like the “square root” of the Turaev-Viro model on 𝒞\mathcal{C}.
In the case that CC is a category of positive energy representations of a loop group ΩG\Omega G of a Lie group GG, then this algebraically defined QFT is thought to be the result of quantization of Chern-Simons theory over the group GG.
As a boundary of the Crane-Yetter model
The Reshetikhin-Turaev model is a boundary field theory of the 4d TQFT Crane-Yetter model (Barrett&Garci-Islas&Martins 04, theorem 2) Related discussion is in Freed “4-3-2 8-7-6”.
Relation to Chern-Simons theory
The RT-construction for group GG is expected to be the FQFT of GG-Chern-Simons theory, though a fully explicit proof of this via quantization is currently not in the literature.
See at quantization of Chern-Simons theory for more on this.
Relation to conformal field theory
The Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert-construction builds from the RT-construction explicitly the rational 2-dimensional 2d CFT boundary theory (see at holographic principle).
A topological quantum field theory is a quantum field theory which – as a functorial quantum field theory – is a functor on a flavor of the (∞,n)-category of cobordisms Bord n SBord_n^S, where the n-morphisms are cobordisms without any non-topological further structure SS – for instance no Riemannian metric structure – but possibly some “topological structure”, such as Spin structure or similar.
For more on the general idea and its development, see FQFT and extended topological quantum field theory.

Remark
Often topological quantum field theories are just called topological field theories and accordingly the abbreviation TQFT is reduced to TFT. Strictly speaking this is a misnomer, which is however convenient and very common. It should be noted, however, that TQFTs may have classical counterparts which would better deserve to be called TFTs. But they are not usually.

What might be called the FRS construction/theorem after Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert, also Fröhlich and Fjelstad (FRS 02, FRS 04a, FRS 04b, FRS 05, FFRS 06, FFRS 08) is a rigorous construction and classification of all rational full 2-dimensional conformal field theories, where “full” means that these theories are defined “at all genera”, namely on all 2-dimensional cobordisms (instead of just on tori, which is a simple special case that much of the other literature traditionally concentrates on (“modular invariance”)).
It is (was earlier) well known that the construction of 2d CFTs may be decomposed into


a “local geometric” aspect which describes the behaviour of the theory on infinitesimal conformal cobordisms and is controled by vertex operator algebras and related structures, which in particular may be used to construct the spaces of conformal blocks of the theory, which are the spaces of potential correlator functions with the right dependence of the conformal structure;


a “global topological” aspects which consists of picking in these spaces of conformal blocks over each surface one element (one correlation function depending on conformal structure) in such a way that these choices globally fit together under gluing of 2-dimensional cobordisms, a condition known as the sewing constraint.


What the FRS theorem effectively observes/shows is that the sewing constraints may be solved by appealing to a holographic principle in form of the AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence. Indeed the FRS formalism may be seen as providing a mathematically precise realization of this correspondence. (That is clear from the construction in the FFRS articles, but the relation to holography was made explicit in various web posts by Urs Schreiber and then later in (Kapustin-Saulina 11)).
Namely given the vertex operator algebra that controls the CFT locally, then in the case of rational CFT (hence for a rational vertex operator algebra) its representation category is a modular tensor category (which may alternatively be obtained from suitable representations of Hopf algebras or of loop groups, but for the full construction one needs in the end an equivalence to reps of a specified VOA) and by the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction or Turaev-Viro construction this defines a 3d TQFT, which is essentially known to be the quantization of 3d Chern-Simons theory.
The way that the FFRS construction now works is that given a surface with field insertions, then the CFT correlator of that is computed by


first triangulating the surface suitably, labelling the triangulation with a Frobenius algebra object internal to the modular tensor category;


passing to the orientation double cover of the surface, filling that with a 3d cobordism with “Wilson loop” ribbons running through it and piercing the surface at the prescribed field insertions, where the ribbons are labeled by the objects of the representation category correpsonding to the field insertions (this makes one label for boundary field insertions and two for bulk field insertions, corresponding to the two “chiral” pieces of closed string CFT)


applying the 3d TQFT functor to this labeled cobordism with ribbons inside to produce an element in its hom-space;


identifying that hom space with the space of conformal blocks and hence finally producing an actual CFT correlator.



Previous to the FRS construction (and still) much of the literature on classification of 2d CFTs concentrated on modular invariant partition functions, hence on CFTs evaluated on a surface which is a torus. One interesting aspect of the FRS classification of full CFTs that are defined not just on the torus but on all surfaces is that it showed examples of modular invariant partition functions in the literature which had all of: one, none, or several extensions to full CFTs.
Since full 2d CFTs are what is relevant in string theory, where these correspond to the vacua that the string perturbation series is perturbing about (while in statistical physics often just the torus is in fact sufficient) this means that the FRS classification is part of the mathematical identification of the landscape of string theory vacua. Now, rational CFTs are known to constitute but a tiny part of that landscape, indeed a discrete subset since any deformation of a rational CFT is non-rational. Nevertheless, rational 2d CFTs (the WZW model!) play an important roles as the “internal” parts of string theory KK-compactifications. Also, even a tiny space is infinitely more than the empty space, which is presently the part of the rest of the “landscape” that is understood rigorously.
Recall that a TQFT is an FQFT defined on the (∞,n)(\infty,n)-category of cobordisms whose morphisms are plain cobordisms and diffeomorphisms between these.
In a conformal quantum field theory the cobordisms are equipped with a conformal structure (a Riemannian metric structure modulo pointwise rescaling): conformal cobordisms.
A conformal field theory (CFT) is accordingly a functor on such a richer category of conformal cobordisms. See the discussion at FQFT for more details.
The conformally invariant quantum field theories have fields for whom the correlation functions have a specific behaviour accounting for the conformal dimension of the fields. This kind of constraints coming from conformal invariance, leads to constraints on the possible behaviour of correlation functions; this has being formulated in 1971 by Polyakov as a conformal bootstrap program: the conformal invariance should be sufficient to classify consistent conformal QFTs directly from the analysis of symmetries, rather than computing the Feynman diagram perturbation series from some action functional; this avoids the usual problems with regularization and renormalization.
Precisely in 2-dimensions is the representation theory of the conformal group exceptionally interesting. In d>2d \gt 2, the global transformations, i.e. the elements of the conformal group, are given by the Poincare algebra, dilations and special conformal transformations. In 22 dimensions, there are additionaly infinitely many local generators of conformal transformations whose commutation relations are given by the Virasoro algebra. This circumstance enables Belavin, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov to make a breakthrough in the bootstrap program in 1984 (what also helped a 1984-1985 revolution in string theory). There are well-developed tools for handling the theory locally (conformal nets, vertex operator algebras) and at least in the rational conformal field theory case there are complete classification results for the full theories (defined on cobordisms of all genera).
For this reason often in the literature the term “CFT” often implicitly refers to 2d CFT.
22-dimensional conformal field theories have two major applications:


they describe critical phenomena on surfaces in condensed matter physics;


they are the building blocks used in string theory


In the former application it is mostly the local behaviour of the CFT that is relevant. This is encoded in vertex operator algebras.
In the string theoretic applications the extension of the local theory to a full representation of the 2d conformal cobordism category is crucial. This extension is called solving the sewing constraints .
In quantum field theory what has come to be known as the holographic principle is the fact that the correlators/partition functions of some quantum field theories of dimension nn may be identified with states of a TQFT of dimension n+1n + 1.

Some details
Notice that for Σ\Sigma an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional manifold with nn-dimensional boundary ∂Σ\partial \Sigma, regarded as a cobordism Σ:∅→∂Σ\Sigma : \emptyset \to \partial \Sigma, an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional TQFT assigns a morphism
Z(Σ):1→Z(∂Σ),
  Z(\Sigma) : 1 \to Z(\partial \Sigma)
  \,,


hence an element of the space Z(∂Σ)Z(\partial \Sigma). Under holography, this element is identified with the partition function of an nn-dimensional QFT evaluated on the manifold (without boundary) ∂Σ\partial \Sigma.
The idea that some systems in physics are governed by other systems “localized at a boundary” in this kind of way was originally suggested by the behaviour of black holes in general relativity: their black hole entropy is proportional to their “surface”, as reflected by the generalized second law of thermodynamics. This made Gerard 't Hooft suggest a general principle, called the holographic principle, which however remained somewhat vague (t’Hooft 93, Susskind 94).
Later, two more precise classes of correspondences were identified, that are regarded now as precise examples of the general idea of the holographic principle:


Systems of Chern-Simons theory and higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory can be shown explicitly to have spaces of states that are canonically identified with correlator spaces of CFTs (conformal blocks) and self-dual higher gauge theory on their boundary.
(The relation of traditional 3d Chern-Simons theory to the 2d WZW model originates in (Witten 89) and hence precedes the proposal of (t’Hooft 93, Susskind 94), but this relation was not recognized from this perspective earlier.)


Systems of quantum gravity in various dimensions as given by string theory on asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetimes have been checked not in total but in a multitude of special aspects in special cases to be dual to supersymmetric CFTs on their asymptotic boundary – this is called AdS/CFT correspondence.



Remark
In view of these two classes of examples it is maybe noteworthy that one can see that also closed string field theory, which is supposed to be one side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, has the form of an infinity-Chern-Simons theory, as discussed there, for the L-infinity algebra of closed string correlators. So maybe the above two different realizations of the holographic principle are really aspects of one single mechanism for ∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory.
Evidence for this also comes from the details of the AdS/CFT mechanism. In (Witten98) it is discussed how the SYM/IIB duality is carried by the Chern-Simons term ∫B NS∧dB RR\int B_{NS} \wedge d B_{RR} in the type II string theory action, the 6d(2,0)/AdS7 duality - is induced by the Chern-Simons term ∫C 3∧dC 3∧dC 3\int C_3 \wedge d C_3 \wedge d C_3 of the 11-dimensional supergravity action.

Below at Examples we list some systems for which something along these lines is known.
More details
We discuss in a bit more detail the central idea of holography, roughly for the case of Chern-Simons type theories and making some simplifications, but giving a precise statement.
The general idea is that fields ϕ\phi in the bulk theory are identified with source fields in the correlation functions of the boundary theory.
The archetypical example is the relation between the correlators of the WZW model on a Lie group GG with the space of quantum states of 3d GG-Chern-Simons theory, as reviewed for instance on page 30 of (Gawędzki 99):
a correlator for the WZW model with source field AA has to satisfy a conformal transformation property called a Ward identity. The space of all suitable functionals satisfying these identities is the space of conformal blocks. That space is equivalently identified with the space of wave functions of Chern-Simons theory depending on the fields AA, hence the quantum states of the CS theory.
More generally, consider some nn-dimensional FQFT Z BZ_B and assume that the spaces of states that it assigns to any (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional manifold XX are of finite dimension (over some ground field ℂ\mathbb{C}):
dimZ B(X)<∞.

  \,.


Stated differently: the vector space Z B(∂Σ)Z_B(\partial \Sigma) is the space of all “potential correlators” of Z BZ_B and Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)} is the particular one chosen by the given model.
If Z BZ_B is really a CFT one calls a subspace Bl B(Σ)⊂Z(∂Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) \subset Z(\partial\Sigma) of elements that respect conformal invariance in a certain way the space of conformal blocks and calls the assignment Σ↦Bl B(Σ)\Sigma \mapsto Bl_B(\Sigma) the modular functor of the model.
Notice that by looking at all “potential correlators” this way we are suddenly assigning vector spaces in codimension 0 (on Σ\Sigma), even though the axioms of an FQFT a priori only mention vector spaces (of states) assigned in codimension 1. Given all these spaces of “conformal blocks”, the (re)construction of Z BZ_B consists of choosing inside each Bl B(Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) the actual correlator Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)} (this way of looking at TQFTs BB is actually the way in which Atiyah originally formuated the axioms of FQFT).
But since we are dealing now with vector spaces assigned to nn-dimensional Σ\Sigma, we can ask the following question:
is there an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional extended TQFT AA such that


there is an isomorphism
Z A(Σ)≃Z B(∂Σ)=Bl B(Σ)
  Z_A(\Sigma) \simeq Z_B(\partial \Sigma) = Bl_B(\Sigma)



such that whenever Σ^\hat \Sigma cobounds Σ\Sigma the linear map


Z A:ℂ=Z A(Σ^)→Z A(Σ^)Z A(∂Σ^)≃Bl B(Σ)
  Z_A : \mathbb{C} = Z_A(\hat \Sigma)
 \stackrel{Z_A(\hat \Sigma)}{\to}
  Z_A(\partial \hat \Sigma)
  \simeq
  Bl_B(\Sigma)


sends 1∈ℂ1 \in \mathbb{C} to Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)}.
If so, we say that AA is a holographic dual to BB.
Notice that Z A(Σ)Z_A(\Sigma) is the space of states of AA over Σ\Sigma, while Bl B(Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) is the space of possible correlators of BB over Σ\Sigma. Under holography, the states of AA are identified with the correlators of BB.
Poisson holography
One of the key statements of the holographic principle is that fields of a bulk field theory correspond to sources in its boundary field theory.
One set-up where this can be made a formal theorem is for 2d Chern-Simons theory which is a non-perturbative Poisson sigma-model. This theorem is discussed at

Holography of higher Chern-Simons/CFT-type
See also AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence.
RT-3d TQFT / rational 2d CFT
The class of examples of “Chern-Simons-type holography” we mention now has fairly completely and rigorously been understood. It is in turn a special and comparatively simple (but far from trivial) case of the historically earliest class of examples: ordinary Chern-Simons theory dual to a 2d WZW model below.
For more see at AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence.
Given any modular tensor category CC the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction produces a 3-dimensional TQFT Z CZ_C. Its space of states over a 2-dimensional surface can be identified (after some work) with a space of conformal blocks for a WZW-model-liked 2d2d CFT. The FRS formalism provides a way to show that the states of Z CZ_C provides correlators that solve the sewing constraints.
Ordinary Chern-Simons theory / WZW-model
For a given Lie group GG, ordinary 3-dimensional GG-Chern-Simons theory for a group GG is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional WZW-model describing the string propagating on GG.
Here is a list with aspects of this correspondence:


At the level of action functionals the relation is directly seen by observing that on a 3-d manifold with boundary the Chern-Simons theory action is not gauge invariant, but has a boundary term depending on the gauge transformation. Since the gauge transformation is a function on the 2d boundary with values in GG, this boundary term is like an action functional for a sigma-model with target space GG, and indeed it is that (subject to some fine-tuning) of the GG-WZW model.
A random source reviewing this is for instance (Arcioni-Blau-Loughlin, p. 6).


More abstractly, at least for simply connected compact GG, the action functionals are also related by transgression of moduli stacks as discussed at infinity-Chern-Simons theory. The action functional of GG-Chern-Simons theory is induced by the morphism
c conn:BG conn→B 3U(1) conn
  \mathbf{c}_{conn} : \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}


from the smooth moduli stack of GG-bundles with connection to the smooth moduli 3-stack of circle 3-bundles with connection (discussed in detail at differential string structure ) in that for Σ 3\Sigma_3 a compact 3d-dimensional surface the Chern-Simons action is the composite
exp(iS CS(−)):[Σ 3,BG conn]→[Σ 3,c conn][Σ 3,B 3U(1) conn]→exp(2πi∫ Σ 3(−))U(1),
  \exp(i S_{CS}(-)) : [\Sigma_3, \mathbf{B} G_{conn}] \stackrel{[\Sigma_3, \mathbf{c}_{conn}]}{\to} [\Sigma_3, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}] \stackrel{\exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_3}(-))}{\to} U(1)
  \,,


where the last morphism is given by fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology.
Topological term in the WZW-model (the B-field background gauge field) is similarly the term appearing in codimension 2. This is discussed at Chern-Simons theory – Geometric quantization – In higher codimension.


At the level of matching space of states of CS-theory with the partition function of the WZW model this is a computation obtained from the geometric quantization of the CS-action, originally due to (Witten). A review is in (Gawedzki, section 5).


If one accepts that the quantization of the GG-Chern-Simons action functional yields the TQFT given by the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction applied to the modular tensor category of GG-loop group representations, then a detailed construction of the correspondence CS-TQFT/WZW-CFT is what the FFRS-formalism achieves. See there for more details.
More comments on the holographic interpretation of this formalism are in (Kapustin-Saulina, Fuchs-Schweigert-Valentino).


Poisson σ\sigma-model / quantum mechanics
Ordinary quantum mechanics induced by quantization of a Poisson manifold – which may be regarded as a 1-dimensional QFT – is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional Poisson sigma-model (implicitly observed by (Kontsevich) made explicit by (CattaneoFelder).
(Notice the Poisson sigma-model is the (n=2)(n = 2)-case of the AKSZ sigma-model which is indeed an example of a infinity-Chern-Simons theory, as discussed there.)
A-model / quantum mechanics
Similarly the A-model on certain D-branes gives a holographic description of ordinary quantum mechanics. (Witten).

Notice that the A-model arises from the Poisson sigma-model, as discussed there.
Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory / Self-dual higher gauge theory
Idea and examples
Generally, higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34k+3 (for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N}) is holographically related to self-dual higher gauge theory in dimension 4k+24k+2 (at least in the abelian case).


(k=0)(k=0): ordinary 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a string sigma-model on its boundary;


(k=1)(k=1): 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a fivebrane model on its boundary;


(k=2)(k=2): 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a parts of a type II string theory on its boundary (or that of the space-filling 9-brane, if one wishes) (BelovMoore).


Some details
We indicate why higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory is – if holographically related to anything – holographically related to self-dual higher gauge theory.
The phase space of higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34k+3 on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} can be identified with the space of flat 2k+12k+1-forms on Σ\Sigma. The presymplectic form on this space is given by the pairing
(δB 1,δB 2)↦∫ ΣδB 1∧δB 2.
  (\delta B_1, \delta B_2) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \delta B_1 \wedge \delta B_2
  \,.


The geometric quantization of the theory requires that we choose a polarization of the complexification of this space (split the space of forms into “coordinates” and their “canonical momenta”).
One way to achieve this is to choose a conformal structure on Σ\Sigma. The corresponding Hodge star operator
⋆:Ω 2k+1(Σ)→Ω 2k+1(Σ)
  \star : \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \to \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)


provides the polarization by splitting into self-dual and anti-self-dual forms:
notice that (by the formulas at Hodge star operator) we have on mid-dimensional forms
⋆⋆B=(−1) (2k+1)(4k+3)B=−B.
  \star \star B = (-1)^{(2k+1)(4k+3)} B
  = - B
  \,.


Therefore it provides a complex structure on Ω 2k+1(Σ)⊗ℂ\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \otimes \mathbb{C}.
We see that the symplectic structure on the space of forms can equivalently be rewritten as
∫ XB 1∧B 2 =−∫ XB 1∧⋆⋆B 2.
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_X B_1 \wedge B_2
    & = - \int_X B_1 \wedge \star \star B_2 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Here on the right now the Hodge inner product of B 1B_1 with ⋆B 2\star B_2 appears, which is invariant under applying the Hodge star to both arguments.
We then decompose Ω 2k+1(Σ)\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) into the ±i\pm i-eigenspaces of ⋆\star: say B∈Ω 2k+1(Σ)B \in \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) is imaginary self-dual if
⋆B=iB
  \star B = i B


and imaginary anti-self-dual if
⋆B=−iB.
  \star B = - i B
  \,.


Then for imaginary self-dual B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 we find that the symplectic pairing is
(B 1,B 2) =−i∫ XB 1∧⋆B 2  =−i∫ X(⋆B 1)∧⋆(⋆B 2)  =+i∫ XB 1∧⋆B 2.
  \begin{aligned}
    (B_1, B_2)
    &=
    -i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
    \\
    & =
    -i \int_X (\star B_1) \wedge \star (\star B_2)
    \\
    & =    
    +i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
  \end{aligned} 
  \,.


Therefore indeed the symplectic pairing vanishes on the self-dual and on the anti-selfdual forms. Evidently these provide a decomposition into Lagrangian subspaces.
Therefore a state of higher Chern-Simons theory on Σ\Sigma may locally be thought of as a function of the self-dual forms on Σ\Sigma. Under holography this is (therefore) identified with the correlator of a self-dual higher gauge theory on Σ\Sigma.

Extended quantum field theory (or multi-tiered quantum field theory) is the fully local formulation of functorial quantum field theory, formulated in higher category theory
Whereas a

1-categoricalTQFT may be regarded as a rule that allows one to compute topological invariants Z(Σ)Z(\Sigma) assigned to dd-dimensional manifolds by cutting these manifolds into a sequence {Σ i}\{\Sigma_i\} of dd-dimensional composable cobordisms with (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional boundaries ∂Σ i\partial \Sigma_i, e.g. Σ=Σ 2∐ ∂Σ 1=∂Σ 2Σ 1\Sigma = \Sigma_2 \coprod_{\partial \Sigma_1 = \partial \Sigma_2} \Sigma_1, then assigning quantities Z(Σ i)Z(\Sigma_i) to each of these and then composing these quantities in some way, e.g. as Z(Σ)=Z(Σ 2)∘Z(Σ 1)Z(\Sigma) = Z(\Sigma_2)\circ Z(\Sigma_1);

we have that

in extended TQFT Z(Σ)Z(\Sigma) may be computed by decomposing Σ\Sigma into dd-dimensional pieces with piecewise smooth boundaries, whose boundary strata are of arbitrary codimension kk.

For that reason extended QFT is also sometimes called local or localized QFT. In fact, the notion of locality in quantum field theory is precisely this notion of locality. And, as also discussed at FQFT, this higher dimensional version of locality is naturally encoded in terms of n-functoriality of ZZ regarded as a functor on a higher category of cobordisms.
The category of extended cobordisms
The definition of a jj-cobordism is recursive. A (j+1)(j+1)-cobordism between jj-cobordisms is a compact oriented (j+1)(j+1)-dimensional smooth manifold with corners whose the boundary is the disjoint union of the target jj-cobordism and the orientation reversal of the source jj-cobordism. (The base case of the recursion is the empty set, thought of as a (−1)(-1)-dimensional manifold.)
nCob dn Cob_d is an nn-category with smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds as objects and cobordisms of cobordisms up to nn-cobordisms, up to diffeomorphism, as morphisms.
There are various suggestions with more or less detail for a precise definition of a higher category nCob nn Cob_n of fully extended nn-dimensional cobordisms.
A very general (and very natural) one consists in taking a further step in categorification: one takes nn-cobordisms as nn-morphisms and smooth homotopy classes of diffeomorphisms beween them as (n+1)(n+1)-morphisms. Next one iterates this; see details at (∞,n)-category of cobordisms.
See

extended cobordism.

Extended TQFT
Fix a base ring RR, and let CC be the symmetric monoidal nn-category of nn-RR-modules.
An nn-extended CC-valued TQFT of dimension dd is a symmetric nn-tensor functor Z:nCob d→CZ: n Cob_d \rightarrow C that maps


smooth compact oriented dd-manifolds to elements of RR


smooth compact oriented (d−1)(d-1)-manifolds to RR-modules


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−1)(d-1)-manifolds to RR-linear maps between RR-modules


smooth compact oriented (d−2)(d-2)-manifolds to RR-linear additive categories


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−2)(d-2)-manifolds to functors between RR-linear categories


etc …


smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds to RR-linear (n−1)(n-1)-categories


cobordisms of smooth compact oriented (d−n)(d-n)-manifolds to (n−1)(n-1)-functors between RR-linear (n−1)(n-1)-categories


with compatibility conditions and gluing formulas that must be satisfied… For instance, since the functor ZZ is required to be monoidal, it sends monoidal units to monoidal units. Therefore, the dd-dimensional vacuum is mapped to the unit element of RR, the (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional vacuum to the RR-module RR, the (d−2)(d-2)-dimensional vacuum to the category of RR-modules, etc.
Here nn can range between 00 and dd. This generalizes to an arbitrary symmetric monoidal category CC as codomain category.
Construction of ETQFT’s


By generators and relations


By path integrals (this is Daniel Freed’s approach)


By modular tensor n-categories?


Classification of ETQFT’s
Assume Z:nCob d→nVect(R)Z: n Cob_d \rightarrow n Vect(R) is an extended TQFT. Since ZZ maps the (d−1)(d-1)-dimensional vacuum to RR as an RR-vector space, by functoriality ZZ is forced to map a dd-dimensional closed manifold to an element of RR. Iterating this argument, one is naturally led to conjecture that, under the correct categorical hypothesis, the behaviour of ZZ is enterely determined by its behaviour on (d−n)(d-n)-dimensional manifolds. See details at cobordism hypothesis.
Relation of ETQFT to AQFT

topological chiral homology.

AQFT from n-functorial QFT.

Algebraic Quantum Field Theory or Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory or AQFT for short is a formalization of quantum field theory (and specifically full, hence non-perturbative quantum field theory) that axiomatizes the assignment of algebras of observables to patches of parameter space (spacetime, worldvolume) that one expects a quantum field theory to provide.
As such, the approach of AQFT is roughly dual to that of FQFT, where instead spaces of states are assigned to boundaries of cobordisms and propagation maps between state spaces to cobordisms themselves.
One may roughly think of AQFT as being a formalization of what in basic quantum mechanics textbooks is called the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics. On the other hand FQFT axiomatizes the Schrödinger picture .
The axioms of traditional AQFT encode the properties of a local net of observables and are called the Haag-Kastler axioms. They are one of the oldest systems of axioms that seriously attempt to put quantum field theory on a solid conceptual footing.
From the nPOV we may think of a local net as a co-flabby copresheaf of algebras on spacetime which satisfies a certain locality axiom with respect to the Lorentzian structure of spacetime:

locality: algebras assigned to spacelike separated regions commute with each other when embedded into any joint superalgebra.

This is traditionally formulated (implicitly) as a structure in ordinary category theory. More recently, with the proof of the cobordism hypothesis and the corresponding (∞,n)-category-formulation of FQFT also higher categorical versions of systems of local algebras of observables are being put forward and studied. Three structures are curently being studied, that are all conceptually very similar and similar to the Haag-Kastler axioms:


factorization algebras


topological chiral homology


blob homology.


Initially, all three of these encoded what in physics are called Euclidean quantum field theories, whereas only the notion of local net incorporated the fact that the underlying spacetime of a quantum field theory is a smooth Lorentzian space. Recent developments in the formalism of factorization algebras have extended their theory to globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds.
In the context of the Haag-Kastler axioms there is a precise theorem, the Osterwalder-Schrader theorem, relating the Euclidean to the Lorentzian formulation: this is the operation known as Wick rotation.

— much information to be filled in —
Generically the algebra of a relativistic AQFT turns out to be a (the) hyperfinite type III 1III_1 von Neumann algebra factor. See (Yngvason)
Examples of AQFT local nets of observables that encode interacting quantum field theories are not easy to construct. The construction of free field theories is well understood, see the references below. In perturbation theory also interacting theories can be constructed, see the references here.
Free scalar field / Klein Gordon field

Free fermion / Dirac field
The free Dirac field and its deformations is discussed for instance in (DLM, section 3.2), (Dimock 83).
Electromagnetic field
The quantized electromagnetic field is discussed for instance in (Dimock 92).
Proca field
(Furliani)
In physics and in the theory of dynamical systems (deterministic, stochastic, quantum, autonomous, nonautonomous, open, closed, discrete, continuous, with finite or infinite number of degrees of freedom…), an observable is a quantity in some theoretical framework whose value can be measured and observed in principle. Any good theoretical framework of physical phenomena should come with carefully established notion of an observable.
In a sigma-model quantum field theory a field history is a morphism ϕ:Σ→X\phi \colon \Sigma \to X for Σ\Sigma an nn-dimensional manifold or similar. One is to think of this as being the trajectory: of an (n−1)(n-1)-brane propagating in the target space XX.
For the case n=1n = 1 (for instance the relativistic particle, a 0-brane) the term worldline for Σ\Sigma has a long tradition. Accordingly one calls Σ\Sigma the worldvolume of the given (n−1)(n-1)-brane when n>1n \gt 1. For the case n=2n=2 (the case of relevance in string theory) one also says worldsheet.
Hence generally for any field theory defined on a worldvolume or spacetime Σ\Sigma, and with type of fields determined by a field bundle E→fbΣE \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma, one may think of a section of the field bundle as a field trajectory.
The space of all these is the space of trajectories (space of histories).
Dynamics affects both observables and, dually, states; this is most well known in quantum mechanics but applies equally well to classical mechanics. The different “pictures” of mechanics differ in how the dynamics is explicitly formalized:


In the Heisenberg picture, the dependence of observables on time (or more generally spacetime) is encoded, while the state is held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by the Haag–Kastler axioms of AQFT.


In the Schrödinger picture, states are propagated through time, while observables are held fixed; the axiomatic formalization of this is given by cobordism category representations in FQFT.


The Dirac (interaction) picture is a mixture of these two approaches: dynamics is split into a free? (or otherwise solvable?) part and an interaction or perturbation; one of these is take to affect the states, the other the observables.


The pictures are named after those physicists (Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and Paul Dirac) who first used or popularised these approaches to quantum physics.
Historically, the terms ‘Schrödinger picture’ and ‘Heisenberg picture’ (at least) referred to more than what we discuss above; they referred to the entirety of the differences between Schrödinger's and Heisenberg's approaches to quantum mechanics.
For example, these terms included also Schrödinger's use of typically wave-like functions as pure states (and correspondingly operators in the higher-type-theoretic sense as observables) vs Heisenberg's use of infinite-dimensional matrices as observables (and correspondingly infinite sequences as pure states). This difference was rectified by von Neumann's application of Hilbert space to the problem, showing that (if one suitably restricts the allowed functions and sequences and also identifies equivalent functions a bit) both approaches used Hilbert space (what we would now call the infinite-dimensional iseparable Hilbert space) as the space of pure states.
This is entirely separate from the question of whether states or observables are taken to evolve with time. Still, there is this connection: Schrödinger evolved states, and his approach was called ‘wave mechanics’ after his representation for states, while Heisenberg evolved observables, and his approach was called ‘matrix mechanics’ after his representation for observables.
The Wightman axioms are an attempt to axiomatize and thus formalize the notion of a quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime (relativistic quantum field theory) in the sense of AQFT, i.e. in terms of the assignment of field quantum observables to points or subsets of spacetime (operator-valued distributions).
They serve as the basis of what is known as constructive quantum field theory which seeks to provide a mathematically sound framework for quantum theory over the Minkowski space background of special relativity. Arthur Wightman first formulated them in the 1950s but they were not published until 1964 after advances in scattering theory confirmed their applicability.
The Wightman axioms served to establish rigorously several basic structural properties of quantum field theories on Minkowski spacetime, such as the spin-statistics theorem or the Osterwalder–Schrader theorem relating Lorenzian and Euclidean quantum field theories (“Wick rotation”).
They were later further abstracted to the Haag-Kastler axioms that characterize local nets of operator algebras and serve as the basis for algebraic quantum field theory. See there for further details.

Wikipedia on the Wightman axioms

The Wightman Reconstruction Theorem
The vacuum expectation values (n-point functions) of the theory are all (tempered, by the axioms) distributions of the form
⟨0|ϕ i 1(f 1)…ϕ i n(f n)|0⟩ 
\langle0| \phi_{i_1}(f_{1})\ldots\phi_{i_n}(f_{n})|0\rangle 


The term “distribution” is used interchangably with “function” and “value” in the physics literature. The Wightman reconstruction theorem states properties that a set of tempered distributions {𝒲 n|n∈N}\{\mathcal{W}^n | n \in \N \} need to have to be the set of vacuum expectation values of a Wightman theory, and all such Wightman theories are then unitarily equivalent. …to be continued…
Equivalence to Euclidean Field Theory
See Osterwalder–Schrader theorem
Equivalence to the Haag–Kastler Axioms
See Haag–Kastler axioms. Since both the Wightman and the Haag-Kastler approach try to formulate an axiomatic approach to quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime, the natural question to ask is what is their relationship? Three possible answers come to mind:


They are equivalent.


One contains the other, i.e. one set of axioms implies the other.


At least one is wrong (from the physical viewpoint).


Unfortunatly the situation does not seem to be as clear as this list suggests. The current state of the affair seems to be that

“the Haag-Kastler approach is more convenient, because it deals with algebras of bounded operators, while Wightman fields are allowed to generate unbounded operators”

and

“a Wightman field theory is equivalent to a Haag-Kastler theory, if some mild additional assumptions are made”.

Reference:

Hans-Jürgen Borchers, Jakob Yngvason, From quantum fields to local von Neumann algebras, Rev. Math. Phys. 4 spec01 (1992) 15-47 [doi:10.1142/S0129055X92000145]


Tim van Beek: The two statemants above are a condensate of diverse papers I read, any input about the true state of the art would be most welcome. My educated guess is that the “mildness” of the assumptions indicates the fact that all physically realistic models are supposed to satisfy these.

Should it be bounded or unbounded operators/observables?


Pro: Some observables do not have an upper bound, e.g. you can always increase the impulse of an electron, no matter how big that already is (in theory).


Contra: A detector has an upper bound for every observable it can detect, and that is what is actually measured in an experiment. The situation of the pro-bullet won’t arise because we measure observables in bounded regions of spacetime, and the energy contained in a bounded region is always finite (we are excluding artifacts like black holes from our consideration, of course).


Contra to even asking the question: Theories of bounded and unbounded operators/observables are physically equivalent modulo mathematical subtleties, meaning they produce the same numbers that can be compared to experiments.


One simple situation where the construction of a Haag-Kastler net out of Wightman fields is straight forward is this: Suppose that all smeared field operators of the Wightman theory are essentially self adjoint for real test functions and commute strongly (their spectral projections commute) if the test functions have space-like separated support. Then we can define local algebras by ℳ(𝒪):={F(Ψ(f))|f\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{O}) := \{F(\Psi(f)) | f is a real test function with support contained in 𝒪\mathcal{O} and F is a bounded Borel measurable function on R}\R \}.
(Our assumptions allow us to use the Borel functional calculus).
The Haag–Kastler axioms (Haag-Kastler 64) (sometimes also called Araki–Haag–Kastler axioms) try to capture in a mathematically precise way the notion of quantum field theory (QFT), by axiomatizing how its algebras of quantum observables should depend on spacetime regions, namely as local nets of observables.
The main point of these axioms is to say that


to every causally closed subset 𝒪⊂X\mathcal{O} \subset X of spacetime XX there is associated a C*-algebra 𝒜(𝒪)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O});


for every inclusion 𝒪 1↪𝒪 2\mathcal{O}_1 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{O}_2 of such spacetime regions there is a corresponding inclusion 𝒜(𝒪 1)↪𝒜(𝒪 2)\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_1) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_2)


such that this respects composition of inclusions (hence such that 𝒜\mathcal{A} is a functor from the poset of causally closed subsets to C*-algebras)


(causal locality) and such that whenever 𝒪 1,𝒪 2⊂𝒪⊂X\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2 \subset \mathcal{O} \subset X are spacelike separated, then the elements of the corresponding algebras of observables (graded-)commute with each other:
[𝒜(𝒪 1),𝒜(𝒪 2)]=t0AAAA∈𝒜(𝒪).
  [\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_1), \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O}_2)]
  = t
  0
  \phantom{AAAA}
  \in \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{O})
  \,.



Moreover one wants these assignments to behave well with spacetime symmetry.
The formulation of quantum field theory via these axioms has come to be known as algebraic quantum field theory or AQFT, for short. There are various further axioms in the list such as the time slice axiom. The precise details of the list of axioms is in flux as the theory develops.
The Haag-Kastler axioms in their original form aim for the description of non-perturbative quantum field theory on Minkowski spacetime. They could be used to give rigorous proof of structural statements of QFT such as the spin-statistics theorem or the PCT theorem, but examples of interacting field theories in dimensions ≥4\geq 4 are missing.
There are however variants:

In perturbative AQFT one drops the requirement of C*-algebras and instead considers just formal power series algebras (in Planck's constant ℏ\hbar) in order to describe perturbative quantum field theory and connect to the traditional construction of pQFTs via the Feynman perturbation series.

The observation that causal perturbation theory yields quantum observables that satisfy the Haag-Kastler axioms, except that C*-algebras are replaced by formal power series algebras, is due to (Il’in-Slavnov 78, Brunetti-Fredenhagen 00, Brunetti-Dütsch-Fredenhagen 09).

In locally covariant perturbative AQFT one generalizes from Minkowski spacetime to more general globally hyperbolic spacetimes in order to describe QFT on curved spacetimes.


In homotopical AQFT one consider homotopical algebras and commutativity only up to coherent homotopy in order to discuss gauge theory with non-trivial topological (instanton) sectors.


Terminology
The approch to quantum field theory based on these axioms is often called AQFT : either for axiomatic quantum field theory (since it was among the first attempts to put the edifice of QFT on solid axiomatic grounds) or algebraic quantum field theory (since it amplifies the algebras of local observables over the spaces of states). Neither of these terms is very descriptive. First there is another, dual, axiomatization which does axiomatize the propagation of states – see FQFT – which, second, is also “algebraic” in some sense, even though algebras of observables to not appear directly.
Another common term for these axioms is local quantum field theory (see the title of the standard textbook (Haag)) since, as becomes clear below, they are focused on encoding the locality properties of QFT in terms of the algebras of observables. However, also the core aspect of extended FQFT is all about the notion of locality of QFT.
Therefore neither of the traditional terms for QFT as axiomatized by Haag-Kastler is truly descriptive in that it genuinely distinguishes from the other, the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization by FQFT. What does distinguish the two approaches may be characterized in traditional terminology of quantum theory as follows (Schreiber, SatiSchreiber):


FQFT axiomatizes the Schrödinger picture of QFT, which encodes the propagation of states through spacetimes;


AQFT axiomatizes the Heisenberg picture of QFT, which encodes the way that observables depend on spacetime.


Motivation
A central difference between the Haag-Kastler axioms and traditionally more widespread formulations of QFT (usually far from being formalized in any way) is the emphasis of the algebra of observables of a QFT (Heisenberg picture) and the de-emphasis of the (Hilbert) spaces of states (Schrödinger picture). This emphasis receives motivation from the the fact that many technical problems of QFT simply disappear when one is not trying to form its spaces of states, while at the same time no real information about the theory is lost.
Examples of technical problems that formulation in terms of spaces of states bring with them are the following:


In quantum field theory as opposed to quantum mechanics, the Stone-von Neumann theorem fails, making the unitary representation of the Heisenberg group on the spaces of states non-unique, hence requiring an explicit choice of representation. There is no generally good theory available for how to make this choice.


More seriously, Haag's theorem says that at a crucial step in perturbation theory where one wants to pass from the representation “free fields” to that of “interacting fields”, the two representations are necessarily inequivalent, contrary to what is (silently or explicitly) assumed in much traditional QFT literature (see EarmanFraser).


In the renormalization or perturbation theory the formulation in terms of states brings with it infrared problems that are simply absent when formulating renormalization just in terms of observables (DuetschFredenhagen).


Structural theorems
It is possible to prove both a spin-statistics theorem and a PCT theorem in the Haag-Kastler approach. The mathematically precise, model independent statements and their proofs are considered to be a major breakthrough of the theory.
Relation to Wightman axioms
Unlike the Wightman axioms, the Haag–Kastler axioms do not need the notion of “field”: the fields in the Wightman axioms are – from the Haag–Kastler point of view – only necessary to describe how the algebras of observables are constructed; any way to consistently construct the net of algebras would suffice.
A Bohr topos is a topos associated with any quantum mechanical system, which is such that

the quantum observables and quantum states of the quantum mechanical system, hence its quantum probability theory,

are equivalently


the classical observables and classical states, hence its classical probability theory,
internal to the Bohr topos, hence in the internal logic of the Bohr topos.


A detailed motivation/derivation of this from classical theorems on the foundations of standard quantum mechanics is at order-theoretic structure in quantum mechanics.
One might think of a Bohr topos as (part of) a formalization of the “coordination” of the physical theory of quantum mechanics, providing a formalized prescription of how to map the theory to propositions about (experimental) observables of the system. The internal logic of Bohr toposes has been argued (e.g. Heunen-Landsman-Spitters 09) to be a better formal context for such considerations than the old quantum logic going back to von Neumann.
The idea of Bohr toposes goes back to Butterfield-Hamilton-Isham, Isham-Döring 07) and Heunen-Landsman-Spitters 09. The concept is named after Niels Bohr, whose informal ideas about the nature of quantum mechanics (e.g. Scheibe 73) it is supposed to formalize, see at interpretation of quantum mechanics – Bohr’s standpoint.
Sometimes in the literature the discussion of Bohr toposes is referred to as “the topos-theoretic formulation of physics”. But actually Bohr toposes currently formalize but one aspect of quantum mechanics, namely “the quantum mechanical phase space” in the form of the quantum observables and the quantum states. The plain Bohr topos does not even encode any dynamics, though in the spirit of AQFT a certain presheaf of Bohr toposes on spacetime does encode dynamics (Nuiten 11). For other and more comprehensive usages of topos theory in the formalization of physics see at geometry of physics and at higher category theory and physics.
Brief
To every quantum mechanical system is associated its Bohr topos: a ringed topos which plays the role of the quantum phase space. The idea of this construction – Bohrification – is that it naturally captures the geometric and logical aspects of quantum physics in terms of higher geometry/topos theory.
One way to understand Bohrification is as a generalization of the construction of the Gelfand spectrum of commutative C-star algebras to a context of noncommutative C *C^*-algebras. It assigns to a noncommutative C *C^*-algebra AA essentially a system of Gelfand dual spaces to each of its commutative subalgebras. Together, this system yields a generalized Gelfand spectrum in the form of a locale Σ̲ A\underline{\Sigma}_A internal to the sheaf topos 𝒯 A\mathcal{T}_A over the poset of commutative subalgebras of AA, or equivalently its externalization Σ A→𝒞(A)\Sigma_A \to \mathcal{C}(A) regarded as a locale over the locale of open subalgebras.
As a topos, the Bohr topos is just a presheaf topos, the topos of presheaves on this poset of commutative subalgebras of AA, but the point is that it is naturally a ringed topos with the original non-commutative algebra AA appearing as a commutative C *C^\ast-algebra internal to the Bohr topos. This allows to talk about quantum states on AA much like classical states, but internal to the Bohr topos.
In fact, under mild assumptions on AA, its poset of commutative subalgebras, and hence the Bohr topos over it, encodes precisely the Jordan algebra underlying AA. As discussed at Jordan algebra, this is precisely that part of AA which knows about the quantum observables themselves. In order to have the Bohr topos remember the full non-commutative algebra structure of AA, it needs to be equipped with the information about Hamiltonian flows induced on AA by automorphisms of the form exp(i[H,−])\exp(i [H,-]), where [−,−][-,-] is the commutator (that gets discarded as one passes to the Jordan algebra). According to Andreas Döring (private communication at MPI Bonn, April 2013), this can be formulated nicely in topos theory.
More detailed
The formalization of the notion quantum mechanical system (see there for details) with its states and observables is the following.


The system as such is encoded by a C-star algebra AA;


a self-adjoint operator a∈Aa \in A is thought of as being an observable of the system: a kind of observation that one can make about it;


a ℂ\mathbb{C}-linear map ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} (which is “positive” and “normalized”) is thought of as being a state that the system can be in – a physical configuration (or rather: a probability distribution of such);


the pairing (a,ρ)↦ρ(a)∈ℂ(a, \rho) \mapsto \rho(a) \in \mathbb{C} is thought of as being the value of the observable aa made on the system in state ρ\rho: for instance the total energy of the system as measured in some chosen unit;


a one-parameter group of automorphisms ℝ→Aut(A)\mathbb{R} \to Aut(A) (inner automorphisms for “localized” systems, see below) is thought of as being an evolution of the system, for instance in time or more general in spacetime.


(Often in the literature quantum mechanical systems are instead dually conceived of in terms of Hilbert spaces of pure states. The relation between these two descriptions is established by the GNS-construction which allows to pass from one to the other.)
Notice that these axioms are naturally thought of as exhibiting the C *C^\ast-algebra AA as a formal dual of the would-be quantum phase space of the physical system – not quite an ordinary topological space (which by Gelfand duality it would be if AA were commutative) but still a kind of generalized space. Traditionally it is common to regard this as a space in noncommutative geometry. Notice that if we do so – hence if we regard the object SpecA∈C *Alg opSpec A \in C^\ast Alg^{op} that is the incarnation of A∈C *AlgA \in C^\ast Alg in the opposite category – then the definition of observable above reduces to the evident notion of real-valued functions on quantum phase space: such a function is a morphism SpecA→ℝSpec A \to \mathbb{R} in C *Alg opC^\ast Alg^{op}, which dually is a C *C^\ast-algebra homomorphism C(ℝ) 0→AC(\mathbb{R})_0 \to A (where on the left we have the unitization of functions with compact support). That such correspond to self-adjoint operators of AA is the statement of functional calculus for C *C^\ast-algebras.
More subtle is the interpretation of the axiom for states. Historically this had been been subject to some discussion: by the spectral theorem two different observables a 1,a 2∈Aa_1, a_2 \in A have a compatible set of observable values if and only if these elements commute with each other in AA. Generally, a set {a i} i\{a_i\}_i of observables has a jointly consistent set of observable values if and only if the sub-C *C^\ast-algebra ⟨{a i} i⟩⊂A\langle \{a_i\}_i\rangle \subset A generated by them is commutative. Therefore for the phenomenological interpretation of the axioms it seems to make no sense to demand that a state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} be linear on non-commuting observables: if a 1a_1 and a 2a_2 do not commute, it is not a-priori clear that it makes sense to require that ρ(a 1+a 2)=ρ(a 1)+ρ(a 2)\rho(a_1 + a_2) = \rho(a_1) + \rho(a_2). This might experimentally fail, and hold only for commuting a 1,a 2a_1, a_2.
Therefore the notion of quasi-state was introduced: a quasi-state on AA is defined to be a (positive and normalized) function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is required to be ℂ\mathbb{C}-linear only on all commutative subalgebras of AA. Operationally, quasi-states should be the genuine states!
One would therefore tend to think that the terminology has been chosen in an unfortunate way. While maybe true, it turns out – non-trivially – that in a major class of cases of interest the distinction does not matter: namely Gleason's theorem states that for HH a separable complex Hilbert space with dimH>2dim H \gt 2 and A=B(H)A = B(H) the C *C^\ast-algebra of bounded operators on H\H, all quasi-states on AA are automatically states: a function that is linear on all commutative subalgebras is automatically also linear on all of AA.
While this means that the distinction between states and quasi-states disappears in a major case of interest, it does not disappear in all cases of interest. In particular, other foundational theorems about quantum mechanics concern the collection of commutative subalgebras, too.
Notably, one may wonder about the evident strengthening of the notion of quasi-states to that of a map ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is not just linear but also an algebra homomorphism on each commuting subalgebra. Notice that by Gelfand duality every commutative C *C^\ast-algebra CC is the algebra of continuous functions on some topological space sp(C)sp(C). Under this duality a state on CC is a probability distribution on sp(C)sp(C), while an algebra homomorphism C→ℂC \to \mathbb{C} is a point of X CX_C. Therefore a quasi-state which is commutative-subalgebra-wise an algebra homomorphism may be thought of as encoding a collection of precise numerical values (as opposed to just expectation values) of all possible observables. Such a hypothetical quasi-state is sometimes called a collection of hidden variables of the quantum mechanical system: its existence would mean that despite the apparent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, there are “hidden” non-probabilistic states. But there are not. This is the statement of the Kochen-Specker theorem: under precisely the assumptions that make Gleason's theorem work, there is no quasi-state which is commutative-subalgebra-wise an algebra homomorphism.
In summary, this means:

The foundational characteristics of quantum physics are encoded in notions of functions on the algebra of observables AA which are linear and positive only commutative-subalgebra-wise .

Since the notion of commutative-subalgebra-wise homomorphism is at the heart of quantum physics, it seems worthwhile to consider natural formalizations of this notion. There is indeed a very natural and general abstract one: whenever any notion of function is defined only locally it is natural to consider the sheaf of such functions over all possible local patches.
The historically motivating example, and possibly still the most widely familiar one, is that of holomorphic functions on a complex manifold: there are in general very few holomorphic functions defined over all of a complex manifold, but plenty of them defined over any small enough subset. And it is of fundamental interest to consider the collections of holomorphic functions over each such subset, and how these restrict to each other under restriction of subsets. This collection of local data is a sheaf of functions on the complex manifold.
There is an evident analog setup of this situation that applies in the present case of interest, that of functions defined on commutative subalgebras:
For AA any C-star algebra, write 𝒞(A)\mathcal{C}(A) for the set of all its commutative C *C^\ast-subalgebras. This is naturally a poset under inclusion of subalgebras. A (co)presheaf of this set is a functor 𝒞(A)→Set\mathcal{C}(A) \to Set. Any such functor we may think of as a collection of commutative-subalgebra-wise data on AA, consistent with restriction of subalgebras. The collection of all such functors – which we write [𝒞(A),Set][\mathcal{C}(A), Set] – is a category called a presheaf topos.
Inside this topos, all the above discussion of foundations of quantum mechanics finds a natural simple equivalent reformulation:
First of all, the non-commutative C *C^\ast-algebra AA naturally induces a commutative C-star algebra object A̲\underline{A} internal to [𝒞(A),Set][\mathcal{C}(A), Set]: namely the copresheaf defined by the tautological assignment
A̲:(C∈𝒞(A))↦C.
  \underline{A} : (C \in \mathcal{C}(A)) \mapsto C
  \,.


In words this means nothing but that the collection of all commutative subalgebras of AA may naturally be regarded as a single commutative C *C^\ast-algebra internal to the topos [𝒞(A),Set][\mathcal{C}(A), Set].
Below we shall discuss (here) that in a precise sense this commutative internal A̲\underline{A} captures precisely all the kinematical information encoded in the quantum mechanical system of AA – everything related to states and observables but not information about (time) evolution. So everything we have discussed so far.
The pair of these two ingredients
Bohr(A):=([𝒞(A),Set],A̲)
  Bohr(A) := ([\mathcal{C}(A), Set], \underline{A})


constitutes what is called a ringed topos – a special case of the notion of a locally ringed topos. This notion is a fundamental notion for generalized spaces in higher geometry. The most advanced general theory of higher geometry (Lurie09) is based on modelling spaces as ringed toposes.
We shall call this ringed topos the Bohr topos of AA.
This terminology is meant to indicate that one may think of this construction as formalizing faithfully and usefully a heuristic that has been emphasized by Nils Bohr – one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics – and is known as the doctrine of classical concepts (Scheibe) in quantum mechanics. This states that nonclassical/noncommutative as the logic/geometry of quantum mechanics may be, it is to be probed and detected by classical/commutative logic/geometry.
Namely in terms of the Bohr topos we have the following equivalent reformulations of the foundational facts about quantum physics discussed above, now internally in Bohr(A)Bohr(A).

Consistent quantum mechanical states. A quasi-state on AA is precisely an ordinary classical state on A̲\underline{A}, internal to Bohr(A)Bohr(A).
In particular (Gleason's theorem): if A=B(H)A = B(H) for dimH>2dim H \gt 2 then a quantum state on the external AA is precisely a classical state on the internal A̲\underline{A}.

and

Non-existence of hidden quantum variables. The Gelfand spectrum sp(A̲)sp(\underline{A}) of A̲\underline{A} internal to the Bohr topos has no global point. (Kochen-Specker).

These two statements might be taken as suggesting that a quantum mechanical system AA is naturally regarded in terms of its Bohr topos Bohr(A)Bohr(A) – somewhat more naturally than as a C *C^\ast-algebra AA. (The second, in a slightly different setup, was emphasized in IshamHamiltonButterfield, which inspired all of the following discussion, the first in Spitters). In fact, thinking of ringed toposes as generalized spaces in higher geometry, it suggests that the Bohr topos Bohr(A)Bohr(A) itself is the quantum phase space of the quantum mechanical system in question.
To which extent this perspective is genuinely useful is maybe still to be established. For pointers to the literature see the references below. Discussion along the above lines may suggest that this perspective is indeed useful, but what is probably still missing is a statement about quantum physics that can be formulated and proven in terms of Bohr toposes, while being hardly conceivable or at least more unnatural without. It is probably currently not clear if such statements have been found.
One potential such statement has been suggested in (Nuiten 11) after discussion with Spitters:
In the formalization of quantum field theory by the Haag-Kastler axioms – called AQFT – every quantum field theory is entirely encoded in terms of its local net of observables over spacetime XX. This is a copresheaf of C-star algebras
A:Op(X)→C *Alg
  A : Op(X) \to C^\ast Alg


which assigns to every open subset U⊂XU \subset X of spacetime the quantum subsystem A UA_U of quantum fields supported in that region. By the above, we may consider for each of these quantum systems their associated quantum phase spaces given by the correspondong Bohr toposes Bohr(A U)Bohr(A_U). This yields a presheaf
Bohr(A):Op(X) op→C com *TopSpace↪C com *Topos
  Bohr(A) : Op(X)^{op} \to C^\ast_{com} TopSpace \hookrightarrow C^\ast_{com}Topos


of ringed toposes whose internal ring object has the structure of a commutative C *C^\ast-algebra. With the copresheaf thus turned into a presheaf it is natural to ask under which conditions this is a sheaf: under which conditions this presheaf satisfies descent.
In (Nuiten 11) the following is observed: if AA satisfies what is called the split property (a strong form of the time slice axiom) then the Bohr-presheaf of quantum phase spaces satisfies spatial descent by local geometric morphisms precisely if the original copresheaf of observables A:Op(X)→C *AlgA : Op(X) \to C^\ast Alg is indeed local – spatially and causally. So this means that a natural property of quantum physics – spatial and causal locality – corresponds from the perspective of Bohr toposes to a natural property of presheaves of quantum phase spaces: descent.
One can probably view this as further suggestive evidence that indeed quantum physics is naturally regarded from the point of view of the Bohr topos. But for seeing where this perspective is headed, it seems that more insights along these lines would be useful.
A factorization algebra is an algebra over an operad where the operad in question is like the little disk operad, but with each disk embedded into a given manifold XX.
This way a factorization algebra is an assignment of a chain complex V DV_D to each ball D⊂XD \subset X embedded in XX, and for each collection of non-intersecting embedded balls D 1,⋯,D n⊂D⊂XD_1 , \cdots, D_n \subset D \subset X sitting inside a bigger embedded ball DD in XX a morphism
V D 1⊗V D 2⊗⋯⊗V D n→V D
  V_{D_1} \otimes V_{D_2} \otimes \cdots \otimes V_{D_n} \to V_{D}


such that composition of such operations is suitably respected.
In Euclidean (Wick rotated) field theory factorization algebras serve to axiomatize the operator product expansion.
Prefactorization algebra

Definition
For XX a topological space write Fact XFact_X be the colored operad in Set whose


objects are the connected open subsets of XX;


the hom-set Fact X({U i} i,V)Fact_X(\{U_i\}_i, V) is the singleton precisely if the U iU_i are all in VV and are pairwise disjoint and is the empty set otherwise.


This specifies composition uniquely.


Definition
For (C,⊗)(C, \otimes) a symmetric monoidal abelian category let End(C)End(C) be its endomorphism operad. A prefactorization algebra on XX with values in CC is an algebra over an operad over Fact XFact_X in CC, hence a morphism of operads
ℱ:Fact X→End(C).
  \mathcal{F} : Fact_X \to End(C)
  \,.

Factorization algebras

Definition
For XX a topological space and U⊂XU \subset X an open subset, a open cover {U i↪U} i∈I\{U_i \hookrightarrow U\}_{i \in I} is called a factorizing cover if for every finite set of points {x 1,⋯,x k}⊂U\{x_1, \cdots, x_k\} \subset U there is a finite subset {U i j} j∈J⊂I\{U_{i_j}\}_{j \in J \subset I}  of pairwise disjoint open subsets such that each point is contained in their union.


Remark
Every Hausdorff space admits a factorizing cover.


Notation
For a factorizing cover {U i→U} i∈I\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I} write PIP I for the set of finite subsets α⊂I\alpha \subset I such that for j,j′∈αj,j' \in \alpha we have U j∩U j′=∅U_j \cap U_{j'} = \emptyset.
Given a prefactorization algebra ℱ\mathcal{F} and α∈PI\alpha \in P I write
ℱ(α):=⊗ j∈αF(U j)
  \mathcal{F}(\alpha) := \otimes_{j \in \alpha} F(U_j)


and for α 1,⋯,α k∈PI\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_k \in P I write
ℱ(α 1,⋯,α k)=⨂ (j 1,⋯,j k)∈α 1×⋯×α kℱ(U j 1∩⋯∩U j k).
  \mathcal{F}(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_k) = 
    \bigotimes_{(j_1, \cdots, j_k) \in \alpha_1 \times \cdots \times \alpha_k}
    \mathcal{F}(U_{j_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{j_k})
  \,.


For each 1≤i≤k1 \leq i \leq k there is a canonical morphism
p i:ℱ(α 1,⋯,α k)→ℱ(α 1,⋯,α i−1,α i+1,⋯,α k).  
  p_i : \mathcal{F}(\alpha_1,\cdots, \alpha_k)
  \to 
   \mathcal{F}(\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_{i-1}, \alpha_{i+1}, \cdots, \alpha_k)
  \,.



Definition
A prefactorization algebra ℱ:Fact X→End(C)\mathcal{F} : Fact_X \to End(C) is called a factorization algebra if for every open subset U⊂XU \subset X and every factorizing cover {U i→U} i∈I\{U_i \to U\}_{i \in I} the sequence
⨁ α 1,α 2∈PIℱ(α 1,α 2)→p 1−p 2⨁ β∈PIℱ(β)→ℱ(U)→0

is an exact sequence.

Homotopy factorization algebras
Let now (C,⊗)(C,\otimes) specifically be a category of chain complexes.

Definition
A [prefactorization algebra] ℱ:Fact X→End(X)\mathcal{F} : Fact_X \to End(X) is a homotopy factorization algebra if for all factorizing covers {U i→U⊂X} i∈I\{U_i \to U \subset X\}_{i \in I} the canonical morpshim

is a quasi-isomorphism, where the differential on the left is defined by (…).


Remark
This is the analogue of a descent condition for simplicial presheaves.

Factorization homology is a notion of homology theory for framed nn-dimensional manifolds with coefficients in En-algebras, due to (Francis). It is similar in spirit to factorization algebras, blob homology and topological chiral homology. In fact the definition of factorization homology turns out to be equivalent to that of topological chiral topology (Francis b).
Write Mfd n ∐Mfd_n^{\coprod} for the category of manifolds with embeddings as morphisms. This is naturally a topological category, hence regard it as an (infinity,1)-category. Regard it furthermore as a symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category with tensor product given by disjoint union.
For kk a field, write Mod kMod_k for the symmetric monoidal (∞,1)-category of kk-chain complexes.
Let H(Mfd n ∐,Mod k)H(Mfd_n^{\coprod}, Mod_k) be the sub-(∞,1)-category of those monoidal (∞,1)-functors F:Mfd n op→Mod kF : Mfd_n^{op} \to Mod_k which are “cosheaves” in that for any decomposition of a manifold XX into submanifolds X′X' and X″X'' with overlap OO, we have an equivalence
F(X)≃F(X′)⊗ F(O)F(X″).
  F(X) \simeq F(X') \otimes_{F(O)}F(X'')
  \,.


Next, let Disk n⊂Mfd nDisk_n \subset Mfd_n be the full sub-(∞,1)-category on those manifolds which are finite disjoint unions of the Cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n.
Restriction along this inclusion gives an (∞,1)-functor
H(Mfd n,Mod k)→Disk n−Alg(Mod k)
  H(Mfd_n, Mod_k)
  \to
  Disk_n-Alg (Mod_k)


This turns out to be an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories. The inverse is defined to be factorization homology
FactorizationHomology:Disk n−Alg(Mod k)→H(Mfd n,Mod k).
  FactorizationHomology
   :
  Disk_n-Alg (Mod_k)
  \to
  H(Mfd_n, Mod_k)
  \,.


which sends an nn-disk algebra A:Disk n→Mod kA : Disk_n \to Mod_k to the functor that sends a manifold XX to the derived coend
∫ XA=𝔼 X⊗ Disk nA
  \int^X A = \mathbb{E}_X \otimes_{Disk_n} A


of AA with
𝔼 X:Disk n→Emb(−,X)Top→C •(−)Mod k.
  \mathbb{E}_X 
    : 
  Disk_n \stackrel{Emb(-,X)}{\to} Top \stackrel{C_\bullet(-)}{\to} Mod_k
  \,.


This is equivalent to topological chiral homology, to be thought of as a topological version of chiral algebras. A version with values in homotopy types instead of chain complexes was given by Salvatore and Graeme Segal.
Relation to cobordism hypothsis
From a functor F∈H(Mfd n,Mod k)F \in H(Mfd_n, Mod_k) we get an extended TQFT with values in kk-linear (∞,n)(\infty,n)-categories
Z F:Bord n→Cat n(k)Z_F : Bord_n \to Cat_n(k) which sends a kk-manifold XX to F(X×ℝ n−k)F(X \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}), regarded as a bimodule between the analogous boundary restriction, and hence as a k-morphism in Cat n(k)Cat_n(k).
From a Disk nDisk_n-algebra AA we obtain the corresponding delooping BA∈(Cat n(k) dualizable) O(n)\mathbf{B}A \in (Cat_n(k)_{dualizable})^{O(n)} which is a kk-linear (infinity,n)-category that is a fully dualizable object. The cobordism hypothesis identifies this with cobordism representations, and the claim is that this identification is compatible factorization homology.
Topological chiral homology is a generalization of Hochschild homology. Where Hochschild homology is given by (∞,1)-colimits of functors constant on an ∞\infty-algebra over a diagram that is an ∞-groupoid, topological chiral homology is given by colimits of constant functors over (∞,1)-categories of open subsets of a manifold.
This generalizes the concept of chiral homology by Beilinson-Drinfeld.
For the moment see the section Topological chiral homology at the entry on Hochschild homology.
Quantum field theory is the general framework for the description of the fundamental processes in physics as understood today. These are carried by configurations of fields under the generalized rules of quantum mechanics, therefore the name. Notably the standard model of particle physics is a quantum field theory and has been the main motivation for the development of the concept in general.
Historically quantum field theory grew out of attempts to combine classical field theory in the context of special relativity with quantum mechanics. While some aspects of it are understood in exceeding detail, the overall picture of what quantum field theory actually is used to be quite mysterious. There are two main approaches for axiomatizing and formalizing the notion:


algebraic quantum field theory: AQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of operator algebras “of observables” to patches of spacetime;


functorial quantum field theory: FQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of spaces of quantum states to patches of codimension 1, and of maps between spaces of states – the time evolution operator – to cobordisms between such patches.


Both these approaches try to capture the notion of a full quantum field theory. On the other hand, much activity in physics is concerned with perturbative quantum field theory. This is a priori to be thought of as an approximation to a full quantum field theory akin to the approximation of a function by its Taylor series, but not the least because it is often the only available technique, the tools of perturbative quantum field theory are to some extent also taken as a definition of quantum field theory.
The gap for instance between the formal study of the AQFT axioms and physics as done in practice by physicists had to a large extent been due to the fact that AQFT had little to say about perturbative quantum field theory. But recently this has been changing. See perturbative quantum field theory for more.
Recent times have seen major progress in understanding these axiomatizations and connecting them to the structures studied in physics (see the references below), but still the number of interesting phenomena in quantum field theory that physicists handle semi-rigorously and that are waiting for a fully formal understanding is large.
By quantization is meant some process that


reads in a system of classical mechanics, or rather of prequantum data in the form of an Lagrangian/action functional and or a phase space equipped with symplectic structure


and returns a corresponding system of quantum mechanics.


Motivation from classical mechanics and Lie theory
We indicate here a systematic motivation of quantization by looking at classical mechanics formalized as symplectic geometry from the point of view of Lie theory (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13, Nuiten 13).
\,
Quantization of course was and is motivated by experiment, hence by observation of the observable universe: it just so happens that quantum mechanics and quantum field theory correctly account for experimental observations where classical mechanics and classical field theory gives no answer or incorrect answers. A historically important example is the phenomenon called the “ultraviolet catastrophe”, a paradox predicted by classical statistical mechanics which is not observed in nature, and which is corrected by quantum mechanics.
But one may also ask, independently of experimental input, if there are good formal mathematical reasons and motivations to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. Could one have been led to quantum mechanics by just pondering the mathematical formalism of classical mechanics? (Hence more precisely: is there a natural Synthetic Quantum Field Theory?)
The following spells out an argument to this effect. It will work for readers with a background in modern mathematics, notably in Lie theory, and with an understanding of the formalization of classical/prequantum mechanics in terms of symplectic geometry.
So to briefly recall, a system of classical mechanics/prequantum mechanics is a phase space, formalized as a symplectic manifold (X,ω)(X, \omega). A symplectic manifold is in particular a Poisson manifold, which means that the algebra of functions on phase space XX, hence the algebra of classical observables, is canonically equipped with a compatible Lie bracket: the Poisson bracket. This Lie bracket is what controls dynamics in classical mechanics. For instance if H∈C ∞(X)H \in C^\infty(X) is the function on phase space which is interpreted as assigning to each configuration of the system its energy – the Hamiltonian function – then the Poisson bracket with HH yields the infinitesimal time evolution of the system: the differential equation famous as Hamilton's equations.
Something to take notice of here is the infinitesimal nature of the Poisson bracket. Generally, whenever one has a Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, then it is to be regarded as the infinitesimal approximation to a globally defined object, the corresponding Lie group (or generally smooth group) GG. One also says that GG is a Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} and that 𝔤\mathfrak{g} is the Lie differentiation of GG.
Therefore a natural question to ask is: Since the observables in classical mechanics form a Lie algebra under Poisson bracket, what then is the corresponding Lie group?
The answer to this is of course “well known” in the literature, in the sense that there are relevant monographs which state the answer. But, maybe surprisingly, the answer to this question is not (at time of this writing) a widely advertized fact that has found its way into the basic educational textbooks. The answer is that this Lie group which integrates the Poisson bracket is the “quantomorphism group”, an object that seamlessly leads to the quantum mechanics of the system.
Before we spell this out in more detail, we need a brief technical aside: of course Lie integration is not quite unique. There may be different global Lie group objects with the same Lie algebra.
The simplest example of this is already one of central importance for the issue of quantization, namely, the Lie integration of the abelian line Lie algebra ℝ\mathbb{R}. This has essentially two different Lie groups associated with it: the simply connected translation group, which is just ℝ\mathbb{R} itself again, equipped with its canonical additive abelian group structure, and the discrete quotient of this by the group of integers, which is the circle group
U(1)=ℝ/ℤ.
  U(1) = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


Notice that it is the discrete and hence “quantized” nature of the integers that makes the real line become a circle here. This is not entirely a coincidence of terminology, but can be traced back to the heart of what is “quantized” about quantum mechanics.
Namely, one finds that the Poisson bracket Lie algebra 𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)\mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) of the classical observables on phase space is (for XX a connected manifold) a Lie algebra extension of the Lie algebra 𝔥𝔞𝔪(X)\mathfrak{ham}(X) of Hamiltonian vector fields on XX by the line Lie algebra:
ℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X).
  \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X)
  \,.


This means that under Lie integration the Poisson bracket turns into an central extension of the group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms of (X,ω)(X,\omega). And either it is the fairly trivial non-compact extension by ℝ\mathbb{R}, or it is the interesting central extension by the circle group U(1)U(1). For this non-trivial Lie integration to exist, (X,ω)(X,\omega) needs to satisfy a quantization condition which says that it admits a prequantum line bundle. If so, then this U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group Ham(X,ω)Ham(X,\omega) of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms exists and is called… the quantomorphism group QuantMorph(X,ω)QuantMorph(X,\omega):
U(1)⟶QuantMorph(X,ω)⟶Ham(X,ω).
  U(1) \longrightarrow QuantMorph(X,\omega) \longrightarrow Ham(X,\omega)
  \,.


While important, for some reason this group is not very well known, which is striking because it contains a small subgroup which is famous in quantum mechanics: the Heisenberg group.
More precisely, whenever (X,ω)(X,\omega) itself has a compatible group structure, notably if (X,ω)(X,\omega) is just a symplectic vector space (regarded as a group under addition of vectors), then we may ask for the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which covers the (left) action of phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega) on itself. This is the corresponding Heisenberg group Heis(X,ω)Heis(X,\omega), which in turn is a U(1)U(1)-central extension of the group XX itself:
U(1)⟶Heis(X,ω)⟶X.
  U(1) \longrightarrow Heis(X,\omega) \longrightarrow X
  \,.


At this point it is worth pausing for a second to note how the hallmark of quantum mechanics has appeared as if out of nowhere simply by applying Lie integration to the Lie algebraic structures in classical mechanics:
if we think of Lie integrating ℝ\mathbb{R} to the interesting circle group U(1)U(1) instead of to the uninteresting translation group ℝ\mathbb{R}, then the name of its canonical basis element 1∈ℝ1 \in \mathbb{R} is canonically “ii”, the imaginary unit. Therefore one often writes the above central extension instead as follows:
iℝ⟶𝔭𝔬𝔦𝔰𝔰(X,ω)⟶𝔥𝔞𝔪(X,ω)
  i \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{poiss}(X,\omega) \longrightarrow \mathfrak{ham}(X,\omega)


in order to amplify this. But now consider the simple special case where (X,ω)=(ℝ 2,dp∧dq)(X,\omega) = (\mathbb{R}^2, d p \wedge d q) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space which is for instance the phase space of the particle propagating on the line. Then a canonical set of generators for the corresponding Poisson bracket Lie algebra consists of the linear functions pp and qq of classical mechanics textbook fame, together with the constant function. Under the above Lie theoretic identification, this constant function is the canonical basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R}, hence purely Lie theoretically it is to be called “ii”.
With this notation then the Poisson bracket, written in the form that makes its Lie integration manifest, indeed reads
[q,p]=i.
  [q,p] = i
  \,.


Since the choice of basis element of iℝi \mathbb{R} is arbitrary, we may rescale here the ii by any non-vanishing real number without changing this statement. If we write “ℏ\hbar” for this element, then the Poisson bracket instead reads
[q,p]=iℏ.
  [q,p] = i \hbar
  \,.


This is of course the hallmark equation for quantum physics, if we interpret ℏ\hbar here indeed as Planck's constant. We see it arises here merely by considering the non-trivial (the interesting, the non-simply connected) Lie integration of the Poisson bracket.
This is only the beginning of the story of quantization, naturally understood and indeed “derived” from applying Lie theory to classical mechanics. From here the story continues. It is called the story of geometric quantization. We close this motivation section here by some brief outlook.
The quantomorphism group which is the non-trivial Lie integration of the Poisson bracket is naturally constructed as follows: given the symplectic form ω\omega, it is natural to ask if it is the curvature 2-form of a U(1)U(1)-principal connection ∇\nabla on complex line bundle LL over XX (this is directly analogous to Dirac charge quantization when instead of a symplectic form on phase space we consider the the field strength 2-form of electromagnetism on spacetime). If so, such a connection (L,∇)(L, \nabla) is called a prequantum line bundle of the phase space (X,ω)(X,\omega). The quantomorphism group is simply the automorphism group of the prequantum line bundle, covering diffeomorphisms of the phase space (the Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms mentioned above).
As such, the quantomorphism group naturally acts on the space of sections of LL. Such a section is like a wavefunction, except that it depends on all of phase space, instead of just on the “canonical coordinates”. For purely abstract mathematical reasons (which we won’t discuss here, but see at motivic quantization for more) it is indeed natural to choose a “polarization” of phase space into canonical coordinates and canonical momenta and consider only those sections of the prequantum line bundle which depend only on the former. These are the actual wavefunctions of quantum mechanics, hence the quantum states. And the subgroup of the quantomorphism group which preserves these polarized sections is the group of exponentiated quantum observables. For instance in the simple case mentioned before where (X,ω)(X,\omega) is the 2-dimensional symplectic vector space, this is the Heisenberg group with its famous action by multiplication and differentiation operators on the space of complex-valued functions on the real line.
Quantization of field theory
An interesting subclass of quantum field theories, especially of perturbative quantum field theories, is thought to arise from prequantum field theory via a process of quantization. This process reads in certain – usually differential geometric – data (Lagrangian field theory), interprets this data as specifying the dynamics of some physical system, and spits out the perturbative quantum field theory that encodes the time evolution of this system.
For more on this see at Wick algebra and causal perturbation theory.
Historically, it was an approximation to the true time evolution that was originally found and studied, by Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and others. This is now known as “classical physics”. The true dynamics in turn is “quantum physics”.
In view of this, quantization is often understood as a right inverse to the procedure that sends the full quantum dynamics to its classical limit. As such it is not well defined, i.e. unique, when it exists. Additional structures sometimes make it unique.

There have been found some formalizations of at least some aspects of quantization, notably there is algebraic deformation quantization and geometric quantization.

These traditional formulations are geared towards mechanics (as opposed to field theory). Even in that restricted application, it seems that a more comprehensive understanding is still missing

The goal is to get closer to a systematic theory of quantization.
(Gukov-Witten 08, p.4)

In the context of field theory the conceptual issues become even more severe. For example the class of field theories called Yang-Mills theory is a core ingredient in the standard model of particle physics but the quantization of Yang-Mills theory (see there for more) poses famous open problems – of which of course that there isn’t yet a comprehensive theory of what this even means is not the least.
In quantum field theory what has come to be known as the holographic principle is the fact that the correlators/partition functions of some quantum field theories of dimension nn may be identified with states of a TQFT of dimension n+1n + 1.

Some details
Notice that for Σ\Sigma an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional manifold with nn-dimensional boundary ∂Σ\partial \Sigma, regarded as a cobordism Σ:∅→∂Σ\Sigma : \emptyset \to \partial \Sigma, an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional TQFT assigns a morphism
Z(Σ):1→Z(∂Σ),
  Z(\Sigma) : 1 \to Z(\partial \Sigma)
  \,,


hence an element of the space Z(∂Σ)Z(\partial \Sigma). Under holography, this element is identified with the partition function of an nn-dimensional QFT evaluated on the manifold (without boundary) ∂Σ\partial \Sigma.
The idea that some systems in physics are governed by other systems “localized at a boundary” in this kind of way was originally suggested by the behaviour of black holes in general relativity: their black hole entropy is proportional to their “surface”, as reflected by the generalized second law of thermodynamics. This made Gerard 't Hooft suggest a general principle, called the holographic principle, which however remained somewhat vague (t’Hooft 93, Susskind 94).
Later, two more precise classes of correspondences were identified, that are regarded now as precise examples of the general idea of the holographic principle:


Systems of Chern-Simons theory and higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory can be shown explicitly to have spaces of states that are canonically identified with correlator spaces of CFTs (conformal blocks) and self-dual higher gauge theory on their boundary.
(The relation of traditional 3d Chern-Simons theory to the 2d WZW model originates in (Witten 89) and hence precedes the proposal of (t’Hooft 93, Susskind 94), but this relation was not recognized from this perspective earlier.)


Systems of quantum gravity in various dimensions as given by string theory on asymptotically anti de Sitter spacetimes have been checked not in total but in a multitude of special aspects in special cases to be dual to supersymmetric CFTs on their asymptotic boundary – this is called AdS/CFT correspondence.



Remark
In view of these two classes of examples it is maybe noteworthy that one can see that also closed string field theory, which is supposed to be one side of the AdS/CFT correspondence, has the form of an infinity-Chern-Simons theory, as discussed there, for the L-infinity algebra of closed string correlators. So maybe the above two different realizations of the holographic principle are really aspects of one single mechanism for ∞\infty-Chern-Simons theory.
Evidence for this also comes from the details of the AdS/CFT mechanism. In (Witten98) it is discussed how the SYM/IIB duality is carried by the Chern-Simons term ∫B NS∧dB RR\int B_{NS} \wedge d B_{RR} in the type II string theory action, the 6d(2,0)/AdS7 duality - is induced by the Chern-Simons term ∫C 3∧dC 3∧dC 3\int C_3 \wedge d C_3 \wedge d C_3 of the 11-dimensional supergravity action.

Below at Examples we list some systems for which something along these lines is known.
More details
We discuss in a bit more detail the central idea of holography, roughly for the case of Chern-Simons type theories and making some simplifications, but giving a precise statement.
The general idea is that fields ϕ\phi in the bulk theory are identified with source fields in the correlation functions of the boundary theory.
The archetypical example is the relation between the correlators of the WZW model on a Lie group GG with the space of quantum states of 3d GG-Chern-Simons theory, as reviewed for instance on page 30 of (Gawędzki 99):
a correlator for the WZW model with source field AA has to satisfy a conformal transformation property called a Ward identity. The space of all suitable functionals satisfying these identities is the space of conformal blocks. That space is equivalently identified with the space of wave functions of Chern-Simons theory depending on the fields AA, hence the quantum states of the CS theory.
More generally, consider some nn-dimensional FQFT Z BZ_B and assume that the spaces of states that it assigns to any (n−1)(n-1)-dimensional manifold XX are of finite dimension (over some ground field ℂ\mathbb{C}):
dimZ B(X)<∞.
  dim Z_B(X) \lt \infty
  \,.


Then for Σ:∂ inΣ→∂ outΣ\Sigma : \partial_{in}{\Sigma} \to \partial_{out}{\Sigma} any cobordism of dimension nn, the correlator
Z B(Σ):Z B(∂ inΣ)→Z B(∂ outΣ)
  Z_B(\Sigma) : Z_B(\partial_{in} \Sigma) \to Z_B(\partial_{out} \Sigma)


that Z BZ_B assigns may naturally be identified, under the closed monoidal structure of Vect, as an element
Z B(Σ)¯ ∈Z B(∂ inΣ) *⊗Z B(∂ outΣ)  ≃Z B(∂Σ).
  \begin{aligned}
  \overline{Z_B(\Sigma)} 
  & \in 
  Z_B(\partial_{in} \Sigma)^{*} \otimes Z_B(\partial_{out} \Sigma)
   \\
   & \simeq
   Z_B(\partial \Sigma)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Stated differently: the vector space Z B(∂Σ)Z_B(\partial \Sigma) is the space of all “potential correlators” of Z BZ_B and Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)} is the particular one chosen by the given model.
If Z BZ_B is really a CFT one calls a subspace Bl B(Σ)⊂Z(∂Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) \subset Z(\partial\Sigma) of elements that respect conformal invariance in a certain way the space of conformal blocks and calls the assignment Σ↦Bl B(Σ)\Sigma \mapsto Bl_B(\Sigma) the modular functor of the model.
Notice that by looking at all “potential correlators” this way we are suddenly assigning vector spaces in codimension 0 (on Σ\Sigma), even though the axioms of an FQFT a priori only mention vector spaces (of states) assigned in codimension 1. Given all these spaces of “conformal blocks”, the (re)construction of Z BZ_B consists of choosing inside each Bl B(Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) the actual correlator Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)} (this way of looking at TQFTs BB is actually the way in which Atiyah originally formuated the axioms of FQFT).
But since we are dealing now with vector spaces assigned to nn-dimensional Σ\Sigma, we can ask the following question:
is there an (n+1)(n+1)-dimensional extended TQFT AA such that


there is an isomorphism
Z A(Σ)≃Z B(∂Σ)=Bl B(Σ)
  Z_A(\Sigma) \simeq Z_B(\partial \Sigma) = Bl_B(\Sigma)



such that whenever Σ^\hat \Sigma cobounds Σ\Sigma the linear map


Z A:ℂ=Z A(Σ^)→Z A(Σ^)Z A(∂Σ^)≃Bl B(Σ)
  Z_A : \mathbb{C} = Z_A(\hat \Sigma)
 \stackrel{Z_A(\hat \Sigma)}{\to}
  Z_A(\partial \hat \Sigma)
  \simeq
  Bl_B(\Sigma)


sends 1∈ℂ1 \in \mathbb{C} to Z B(Σ)¯\overline{Z_B(\Sigma)}.
If so, we say that AA is a holographic dual to BB.
Notice that Z A(Σ)Z_A(\Sigma) is the space of states of AA over Σ\Sigma, while Bl B(Σ)Bl_B(\Sigma) is the space of possible correlators of BB over Σ\Sigma. Under holography, the states of AA are identified with the correlators of BB.
Poisson holography
One of the key statements of the holographic principle is that fields of a bulk field theory correspond to sources in its boundary field theory.
One set-up where this can be made a formal theorem is for 2d Chern-Simons theory which is a non-perturbative Poisson sigma-model. This theorem is discussed at


off-shell Poisson bracket – boundary field theory interpretation.


motivic quantization – Poisson holography.


Holography of higher Chern-Simons/CFT-type
See also AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence.
RT-3d TQFT / rational 2d CFT
The class of examples of “Chern-Simons-type holography” we mention now has fairly completely and rigorously been understood. It is in turn a special and comparatively simple (but far from trivial) case of the historically earliest class of examples: ordinary Chern-Simons theory dual to a 2d WZW model below.
For more see at AdS3-CFT2 and CS-WZW correspondence.
Given any modular tensor category CC the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction produces a 3-dimensional TQFT Z CZ_C. Its space of states over a 2-dimensional surface can be identified (after some work) with a space of conformal blocks for a WZW-model-liked 2d2d CFT. The FRS formalism provides a way to show that the states of Z CZ_C provides correlators that solve the sewing constraints.
Ordinary Chern-Simons theory / WZW-model
For a given Lie group GG, ordinary 3-dimensional GG-Chern-Simons theory for a group GG is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional WZW-model describing the string propagating on GG.
Here is a list with aspects of this correspondence:


At the level of action functionals the relation is directly seen by observing that on a 3-d manifold with boundary the Chern-Simons theory action is not gauge invariant, but has a boundary term depending on the gauge transformation. Since the gauge transformation is a function on the 2d boundary with values in GG, this boundary term is like an action functional for a sigma-model with target space GG, and indeed it is that (subject to some fine-tuning) of the GG-WZW model.
A random source reviewing this is for instance (Arcioni-Blau-Loughlin, p. 6).


More abstractly, at least for simply connected compact GG, the action functionals are also related by transgression of moduli stacks as discussed at infinity-Chern-Simons theory. The action functional of GG-Chern-Simons theory is induced by the morphism
c conn:BG conn→B 3U(1) conn
  \mathbf{c}_{conn} : \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}


from the smooth moduli stack of GG-bundles with connection to the smooth moduli 3-stack of circle 3-bundles with connection (discussed in detail at differential string structure ) in that for Σ 3\Sigma_3 a compact 3d-dimensional surface the Chern-Simons action is the composite
exp(iS CS(−)):[Σ 3,BG conn]→[Σ 3,c conn][Σ 3,B 3U(1) conn]→exp(2πi∫ Σ 3(−))U(1),
  \exp(i S_{CS}(-)) : [\Sigma_3, \mathbf{B} G_{conn}] \stackrel{[\Sigma_3, \mathbf{c}_{conn}]}{\to} [\Sigma_3, \mathbf{B}^3 U(1)_{conn}] \stackrel{\exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_3}(-))}{\to} U(1)
  \,,


where the last morphism is given by fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology.
Topological term in the WZW-model (the B-field background gauge field) is similarly the term appearing in codimension 2. This is discussed at Chern-Simons theory – Geometric quantization – In higher codimension.


At the level of matching space of states of CS-theory with the partition function of the WZW model this is a computation obtained from the geometric quantization of the CS-action, originally due to (Witten). A review is in (Gawedzki, section 5).


If one accepts that the quantization of the GG-Chern-Simons action functional yields the TQFT given by the Reshetikhin-Turaev construction applied to the modular tensor category of GG-loop group representations, then a detailed construction of the correspondence CS-TQFT/WZW-CFT is what the FFRS-formalism achieves. See there for more details.
More comments on the holographic interpretation of this formalism are in (Kapustin-Saulina, Fuchs-Schweigert-Valentino).


Poisson σ\sigma-model / quantum mechanics
Ordinary quantum mechanics induced by quantization of a Poisson manifold – which may be regarded as a 1-dimensional QFT – is holographically dual to the 2-dimensional Poisson sigma-model (implicitly observed by (Kontsevich) made explicit by (CattaneoFelder).
(Notice the Poisson sigma-model is the (n=2)(n = 2)-case of the AKSZ sigma-model which is indeed an example of a infinity-Chern-Simons theory, as discussed there.)
A-model / quantum mechanics
Similarly the A-model on certain D-branes gives a holographic description of ordinary quantum mechanics. (Witten).

quantization via the A-model

Notice that the A-model arises from the Poisson sigma-model, as discussed there.
Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory / Self-dual higher gauge theory
Idea and examples
Generally, higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34k+3 (for k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N}) is holographically related to self-dual higher gauge theory in dimension 4k+24k+2 (at least in the abelian case).


(k=0)(k=0): ordinary 3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a string sigma-model on its boundary;


(k=1)(k=1): 7-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a fivebrane model on its boundary;


(k=2)(k=2): 11-dimensional Chern-Simons theory is related to a parts of a type II string theory on its boundary (or that of the space-filling 9-brane, if one wishes) (BelovMoore).


Some details
We indicate why higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory is – if holographically related to anything – holographically related to self-dual higher gauge theory.
The phase space of higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34k+3 on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} can be identified with the space of flat 2k+12k+1-forms on Σ\Sigma. The presymplectic form on this space is given by the pairing
(δB 1,δB 2)↦∫ ΣδB 1∧δB 2.
  (\delta B_1, \delta B_2) \mapsto
  \int_\Sigma \delta B_1 \wedge \delta B_2
  \,.


The geometric quantization of the theory requires that we choose a polarization of the complexification of this space (split the space of forms into “coordinates” and their “canonical momenta”).
One way to achieve this is to choose a conformal structure on Σ\Sigma. The corresponding Hodge star operator
⋆:Ω 2k+1(Σ)→Ω 2k+1(Σ)
  \star : \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \to \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma)


provides the polarization by splitting into self-dual and anti-self-dual forms:
notice that (by the formulas at Hodge star operator) we have on mid-dimensional forms
⋆⋆B=(−1) (2k+1)(4k+3)B=−B.
  \star \star B = (-1)^{(2k+1)(4k+3)} B
  = - B
  \,.


Therefore it provides a complex structure on Ω 2k+1(Σ)⊗ℂ\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) \otimes \mathbb{C}.
We see that the symplectic structure on the space of forms can equivalently be rewritten as
∫ XB 1∧B 2 =−∫ XB 1∧⋆⋆B 2.
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_X B_1 \wedge B_2
    & = - \int_X B_1 \wedge \star \star B_2 
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


Here on the right now the Hodge inner product of B 1B_1 with ⋆B 2\star B_2 appears, which is invariant under applying the Hodge star to both arguments.
We then decompose Ω 2k+1(Σ)\Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) into the ±i\pm i-eigenspaces of ⋆\star: say B∈Ω 2k+1(Σ)B \in \Omega^{2k+1}(\Sigma) is imaginary self-dual if
⋆B=iB
  \star B = i B


and imaginary anti-self-dual if
⋆B=−iB.
  \star B = - i B
  \,.


Then for imaginary self-dual B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 we find that the symplectic pairing is
(B 1,B 2) =−i∫ XB 1∧⋆B 2  =−i∫ X(⋆B 1)∧⋆(⋆B 2)  =+i∫ XB 1∧⋆B 2.
  \begin{aligned}
    (B_1, B_2)
    &=
    -i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
    \\
    & =
    -i \int_X (\star B_1) \wedge \star (\star B_2)
    \\
    & =    
    +i \int_X B_1 \wedge \star B_2
  \end{aligned} 
  \,.


Therefore indeed the symplectic pairing vanishes on the self-dual and on the anti-selfdual forms. Evidently these provide a decomposition into Lagrangian subspaces.
Therefore a state of higher Chern-Simons theory on Σ\Sigma may locally be thought of as a function of the self-dual forms on Σ\Sigma. Under holography this is (therefore) identified with the correlator of a self-dual higher gauge theory on Σ\Sigma.

In the real numbers
Epsilon-delta definition
Let ℝ\mathbb{R} be the real numbers. A function f:ℝ→ℝf:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is smooth if it comes with a sequence of functions D (−)f:ℕ→(ℝ→ℝ)D^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}) and a sequence of functions M (−)f:ℕ→(ℚ +→ℚ +)M^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{Q}_+ \to \mathbb{Q}_+) in the positive rational numbers, such that


for every real number x∈ℝx \in \mathbb{R}, (D 0f)(x)=f(x)(D^{0}f)(x) = f(x)


for every natural number n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, for every positive rational number ϵ∈ℚ +\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_+, for every real number h∈ℝh \in \mathbb{R} such that 0<|h|<M nf(ϵ)0 \lt | h | \lt M^{n}f(\epsilon), and for every real number x∈ℝx \in \mathbb{R},
|(D nf)(x+h)−(D nf)(x)−h(D n+1f)(x)|<ϵ|h||(D^{n}f)(x + h) - (D^{n}f)(x) - h (D^{n + 1}f)(x)| \lt \epsilon |h|

Unwrapping the recursive definition above, a function f:ℝ→ℝf:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is smooth if it comes with a sequence of functions D (−)f:ℕ→(ℝ→ℝ)D^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}) and a sequence of functions M (−)f:ℕ→(ℚ +→ℚ +)M^{(-)}f:\mathbb{N} \to (\mathbb{Q}_+ \to \mathbb{Q}_+) in the positive rational numbers, such that


for every real number x∈ℝx \in \mathbb{R}, (D 0f)(x)=f(x)(D^{0}f)(x) = f(x)


for every natural number n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, for every positive rational number ϵ∈ℚ +\epsilon \in \mathbb{Q}_+, for every real number h∈ℝh \in \mathbb{R} such that 0<|h|<M nf(ϵ)0 \lt | h | \lt M^{n}f(\epsilon), and for every real number x∈ℝx \in \mathbb{R},
|f(x+h)−∑ i=0 nh i(D if)(x)i!|<ϵ|h n|\left|f(x + h) - \sum_{i=0}^n \frac{h^i (D^{i}f)(x)}{i!}\right| \lt \epsilon |h^n|

 Infintesimal definition
Given a predicate PP on the real numbers ℝ\mathbb{R}, let II denote the set of all elements in ℝ\mathbb{R} for which PP holds. A partial function f:ℝ→ℝf:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is equivalently a function f:I→ℝf:I \to \mathbb{R} for any such predicate PP and set II.
A function f:I→ℝf:I \to \mathbb{R} is smooth at a subset S⊆IS \subseteq I with injection j:S↪ℝj:S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} if it has a function d −fdx −:ℕ×S→ℝ\frac{d^{-} f}{d x^{-}}:\mathbb{N} \times S \to \mathbb{R} with d 0fdx 0(a)=a\frac{d^0 f}{d x^0}\left(a\right) = a for all a∈Sa \in S, such that for all Archimedean ordered Artinian local ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebras AA with ring homomorphism h A:ℝ→Ah_A:\mathbb{R} \to A and nilradical DD, natural numbers n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, and purely infinitesimal elements ϵ∈D\epsilon \in D such that ϵ n+1=0\epsilon^{n + 1} = 0
f A(h A(j(a))+ϵ)=∑ i=0 n1i!h A(d ifdx i(a))ϵ if_A(h_A(j(a)) + \epsilon) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \frac{1}{i!} h_A\left(\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}\left(a\right)\right) \epsilon^i
Equivalently, let ℝ[[ϵ]]\mathbb{R}[[\epsilon]] denote the ring of univariate formal power series on ℝ\mathbb{R}. ℝ[[ϵ]]\mathbb{R}[[\epsilon]] is a Artinian local ℝ\mathbb{R}-algebra with homomorphism h:ℝ→ℝ[[ϵ]]h:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}[[\epsilon]]. A function f:I→ℝf:I \to \mathbb{R} is smooth at a subset S⊆IS \subseteq I with injection j:S↪ℝj:S \hookrightarrow \mathbb{R} if it has a function d −fdx −:ℕ×S→ℝ\frac{d^{-} f}{d x^{-}}:\mathbb{N} \times S \to \mathbb{R} with d 0fdx 0(a)=a\frac{d^0 f}{d x^0}\left(a\right) = a for all a∈Sa \in S, such that for all natural numbers n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}
f A(h(j(a))+ϵ)=∑ i=0 ∞1i!h(d ifdx i(a))ϵ if_A(h(j(a)) + \epsilon) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i!} h\left(\frac{d^i f}{d x^i}\left(a\right)\right) \epsilon^i
A function f:I→ℝf:I \to \mathbb{R} is smooth at an element a∈Ia \in I if it is smooth at the singleton subset {a}\{a\}, and a function f:I→ℝf:I \to \mathbb{R} is smooth if it is smooth at the improper subset of II.
Between Cartesian spaces
A function on (some open subset of) a cartesian space ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n with values in the real line ℝ\mathbb{R} is smooth, or infinitely differentiable, if all its derivatives exist at all points. More generally, if A⊆ℝ nA \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n is any subset, a function f:A→ℝf: A \to \mathbb{R} is defined to be smooth if it has a smooth extension to an open subset containing AA.
By coinduction: A function f:ℝ→ℝf : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} is smooth if (1) its derivative exists and (2) the derivative is itself a smooth function.
For A⊆ℝ nA \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n, a smooth map ϕ:A→ℝ m\phi: A \to \mathbb{R}^m is a function such that π∘ϕ\pi \circ \phi is a smooth function for every linear functional π:ℝ m→ℝ\pi: \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}. (In the case of finite-dimensional codomains as here, it suffices to take the π\pi to range over the mm coordinate projections.)
The concept can be generalised from cartesian spaces to Banach spaces and some other infinite-dimensional spaces. There is a locale-based analogue suitable for constructive mathematics which is not described as a function of points but as a special case of a continuous map (in the localic sense).
Between smooth manifolds
A topological manifold whose transition functions are smooth maps is a smooth manifold. A smooth function between smooth manifolds is a function that (co-)restricts to a smooth function between subsets of Cartesian spaces, as above, with respect to any choice of atlases, hence which is a kk-fold differentiable function (see there for more details), for all kk The category Diff is the category whose objects are smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth maps betweeen them.
Between generalized smooth spaces
There are various categories of generalised smooth spaces whose morphisms are generalized smooth functions.
For details see for example at smooth set.
Basic facts about smooth functions are


the Hadamard lemma


Borel's theorem


the Tietze extension theorem


the Steenrod-Wockel approximation theorem


embedding of smooth manifolds into formal duals of R-algebras


derivations of smooth functions are vector fields


Often a (smooth) function on an infinite-dimensional manifold (or on a more general smooth space) is called a functional, especially when scalar-valued. A central example are the action functionals in physics. The calculus of variations is largely about such functionals.
To distinguish from the specifically linear functionals in functional analysis, one might speak here of nonlinear functionals. However, in practice the context is usually understood and the adjective “nonlinear” is rarely used explicitly. There are also nonlinear functionals in functional analysis, such as quadratic forms.
The reason for the name is that (like the infinite-dimensional vector spaces of functional analysis), these infinite-dimensional manifolds were originally spaces of functions (typically between finite-dimensional manifolds), and functions of functions are the original meaning of functional.
In physics the dynamics of a physical system may be encoded by a nonlinear functional – called the action functional – on its configuration space:


in classical mechanics and classical field theory – by the action principle or principle of least action – the extrema of the action functional – obtained by variational calculus and given by Euler-Lagrange equations – encode the physically observable configurations ;


in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the evolution of the quantum states is encoded by the integral – the path integral – of the exponentiated action functional over the space of field configurations.


For emphasis the description of dynamics by action functionals is called the Lagrangean approach. Another formulation of dynamics in physics that does not involve an action functional explicitly is Hamiltonian mechanics on phase space. At least in certain classes of cases the relation and equivalence of both approaches is understood. Generally the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of action functionals suffers from a lack of precise understanding of what the path integral over the action functional really means.



Taken from A Zee, Fearful Symmetry


Let H\mathbf{H} be the ambient (∞,1)-topos with a natural numbers object and equipped with an additive continuum line object 𝔸 1\mathbb{A}^1 (see there). Let C∈HC \in \mathbf{H} be the configuration space of a physical system. Then an action functional is a morphism
exp(iℏS(−)):C→𝔸 1/ℤ
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 / \mathbb{Z}
  \,


(here ℏ\hbar refers to Planck's constant).
If H\mathbf{H} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then there is an intrinsic differential of the action functional to a morphism
dexp(iℏS(−)):C→♭ dR𝔸 1/ℤ.
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


The equation
dexp(iℏS(−))=0  
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) = 0


is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the system. It characterizes the critical locus of SS is the covariant phase space inside the configuration space: the space of classically realized trajectories/histories of the system. If H\mathbf{H} models derived geometry then this critical locus is presented by a BRST-BV complex.
Local action functionals (traditional theory)
An action functional is called local if it arises from integration of a Lagrangian.
In traditional theory this is interpreted as follows: an action functional S:C→𝔸 1S : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 is called local if


the configuration space CC is the space C=Γ X(E)C = \Gamma_X(E) of sections of a fiber bundle E→XE \to X over some parameter space (spacetime XX);


there is a Lagrangian density J ∞(E)→Ω dimX(X)J_\infty(E) \to \Omega^{\dim X}(X) on the jet bundle of EE;


on a section/field configuration ϕ:X→E\phi : X \to E the action SS takes the value
S(ϕ)=∫ XL(j ∞(ϕ)),
  S(\phi) = \int_X L(j_\infty(\phi))
  \,,


where j ∞(ϕ)=(ϕ,∂ iϕ,⋯)j_\infty(\phi) = (\phi, \partial_i \phi, \cdots) is the jet-prolongation of ϕ\phi (the collection of all its higher partial derivatives).


Consider action functional for on a configuration space of smooth functions from the line to a smooth manifold XX.
We can consider

S(q)=∫ a bL(q,q˙)dt S(q) = \int_a^b L(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}t , where qq is a path through configuration space, on the time interval [a,b][a,b], with derivative q˙=dq/dt\dot{q} = \mathrm{d}q/\mathrm{d}t. When minimising the action, we fix the values of q(a)q(a) and q(b)q(b).
L(q,q˙)=∫ Sℒ(q,q˙)dxdydz L(q,\dot{q}) = \int_{S} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z , where now qq is a configuration of fields on SS, which is a region of space. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of SS (typically that qq and q˙\dot{q} go to zero if SS is all of space).
S(q)=∫ Rℒ(q,q˙)dxdydzdt S(q) = \int_{R} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t , where now qq is a configuration of fields on RR, which a region of spacetime, with time derivative q˙=∂q/∂t\dot{q} = \partial{q}/\partial{t}. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of RR.

The formulation of (3) above is still not manifestly coordinate independent. However, dxdydzdt\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t is simply the volume form on spacetime and q˙\dot{q} is merely one choice of coordinate on state space and could just as easily be replaced by a derivative with respect to any timelike coordinate on spacetime (or drop coordinates altogether).
Extended local action functionals in (higher) gauge theory
For gauge theories and higher gauge theories the configuration spaces of the physical system are in general not plain manifolds or similar, but are orbifolds or more generally smooth groupoids, smooth ∞-groupoids. (An exposition of and introduction to much of the following is at geometry of physics.)
For instance for GG a Lie group and BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} the smooth moduli stack of GG-principal connections (see at connection on a bundle), then the smooth groupoid of GG-gauge field configurations is the internal hom/mapping stack [Σ,BG conn]∈[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \in Smooth∞Grpd (or some concretification thereof, see at geometric of physics – differential moduli: this is the smooth groupoid whose objects are GG-gauge field-configurations on Σ\Sigma (connections on GG-principal bundles over Σ\Sigma), and whose morphisms are gauge transformations between these. The infinitesimal approximation to this smooth ∞-groupoid, its ∞-Lie algebroid is the (off-shell) BRST complex of the theory. The tangent to the nn-fold higher gauge transformations becomes the nn-fold ghosts in the BRST complex.
More generally GG here can by any smooth ∞-group, such as the circle n-group B n−1U(1)\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1) or the String 2-group or the Fivebrane 6-group, and so on, in which case [Σ,BG conn][\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] is the smooth ∞-groupoid of higher gauge field, gauge transformations between these, higher gauge transformations between those, and so on.
Notice that this means in particular that in higher geometry a gauge theory is a sigma-model quantum field theory: one whose target space is not just a plain manifold but is a moduli stack of gauge field configurations.
A gauge invariant action functional is then a morphism of smooth ∞-groupoids
exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]→U(1).
  \exp( i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to U(1)
  \,.


This is of particular interest, again, if it is local. In fact, in this context now we can also ask that it is “extended” in the sense of extended topological quantum field theory: that we have an action functional not only in top dimension, being a function, but also in codimension 1, being a prequantum bundle, and in higher codimension, being a prequantum n-bundle.
This is notably the case for all (higher) gauge theories of infinity-Chern-Simons theory type, such as ordinary Chern-Simons theory and such as ordinary Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, as well as its higher generalizations. In these cases the action functional exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]\exp(i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] arises itself from transgression of an extended Lagrangian that is defined on the universal moduli stack of gauge field configurations BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} itself, namely from a universal characteristic class in higher nonabelian differential cohomology of the form
L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn.
  \mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


Here B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} is the universal smooth moduli infinity-stack for circle n-bundles with connection. Such a morphism of moduli stacks locally takes a connection differential form AA to a Chern-Simons form CS(A)CS(A), but globally it sends the underlying principal bundle to a circle (n-1)-group principal ∞-bundle and accordingly acts globally on the connection. This is hence a fully local Lagrangian: an extended Lagrangian. Alternatively, one may think of this whole morphism as modulating a prequantum circle n-bundle on the universal moduli stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of gauge fields itself.
For instance for ordinary Chern-Simons theory here n=3n = 3 GG is a semisimple Lie group and L\mathbf{L} is a smooth and differential refinement of the first Pontryagin class/second Chern class, or of an integral multiple of that (the “level” of the theory). In this case L\mathbf{L} may also be thought of as modulating the universal Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. If instead GG is a discrete group then L\mathbf{L} is a cocycle in the U(1)U(1)-group cohomology and this is the extended Lagrangian of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
This extended Lagrangian becomes an extended action functional after transgression: the operation of fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology refines to a morphism of moduli stacks of the form
exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−)):[Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→B n−kU(1) conn,
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k} (-))
  \colon
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{\mathrm{conn}} ]
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n-k}U(1)_{conn}
 \,,


where Σ\Sigma is an oriented closed manifold of dimension kk. This morphism locally simply takes a differential n-form to its ordinary integration of differential forms over Σ k\Sigma_k, but globally it takes the correct higher holonomy of circle n-bundles with connection.
Combining this with an extended ∞-Chern-Simons theory Lagrangian L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn\mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} as above yields for each dimension kk a prequantum circle n-bundle on the space of gauge field configurations over Σ k\Sigma_k, by forming the transgression composite
exp(iS(−))≔exp(2πi∫ Σ k[Σ k,L]):[Σ k,BG conn]→[Σ k,L][Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−))B n−kU(1) conn.
  \exp(i S(-))
  \coloneqq
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k} [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{L}])
   \;\; \colon \;\;
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}]
  \stackrel{[\Sigma_k, \mathbf{L}]}{\to}
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}]
  \stackrel{\exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k}(-))}{\to}
  \mathbf{B}^{n-k}U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


This morphism locally takes the local differential form incarnation AA of a connection on an ∞-bundle to the exponentiation of the integration of differential forms ∫ ΣCS(A)\int_\Sigma CS(A) of some higher Chern-Simons form, but globally it computes the correct higher holonomy of the higher circle n-bundle with connection over the universal moduli stack of fields, as modulated by the extended Lagrangian L\mathbf{L}.
A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.

Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.

Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).

This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.

where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.

Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
A fibre bundle or fiber bundle is a bundle in which every fibre is isomorphic, in some coherent way, to a standard fibre or typical fiber. Usually one also requires that it be locally trivial, hence locally of the form of a Cartesian product with that typical fiber.
Relation to fibrations


Proposition

Every locally trivial topological fiber bundle projection is a Serre fibration, and a Hurewicz fibration if it is also a numerable bundle.





Proof
It is clear that the projection out of a Cartesian product is a Serre fibration. With this, the statement follows from local triviality and the local recognition of Serre fibrations (this Prop) and of Hurewicz fibrations (this Prop.), respectively.




Remark
Beware that the converse statement is far from being true.


A connection on a bundle P→XP \to X – a principal bundle or an associated bundle like a vector bundle – is a rule that identifies fibers of the bundle along paths in the base space XX.
There are several different but equivalent formalizations of this idea:


as a parallel transport functor,


as a rule for a covariant derivative,


as a distribution (field) of horizontal subspaces – an Ehresmann connection – and via a connection 11-form which annihilates the distribution of horizontal subspaces. The connection in that sense induces a smooth version of Hurewicz connection.


The usual textbook convention is to say just connection for the distribution of horizontal subspaces, and the objects of the other three approaches one calls more specifically covariant derivative, connection 11-form and parallel transport.
In the remainder of this Idea-section we discuss a bit more how to understand connections in terms of parallel transport.
Given a smooth bundle P→XP \to X, for instance a GG-principal bundle or a vector bundle, a connection on PP is a prescription to associate with each path
γ:x→y
  \gamma : x \to y


in XX (which is a morphism in the path groupoid P 1(X)\mathbf{P}_1(X)) a morphism tra(γ)tra(\gamma) between the fibers of PP over these points
P x →tra(γ) P y x →γ y
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma)}{\to}& P_y
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& y
  }


such that


this assignment respects the structure on the fibers P xP_x (for instance is GG-equivariant in the case that PP is a GG-bundle or that is linear in the case that PP is a vector bundle);


this assignment is smooth in a suitable sense;


this assignment is functorial in that for all pairs x→γyx \stackrel{\gamma}{\to} y, y→γ′zy \stackrel{\gamma'}{\to} z of composable paths in XX we have
P x →tra(γ) P y →tra(γ′) P z x →γ y →γ′ z=P x →tra(γ′∘γ) P z x →γ′∘γ z
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma)}{\to}& P_y &\stackrel{tra(\gamma')}{\to}& P_z
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma}{\to}& y &\stackrel{\gamma'}{\to}& z
  }
  \;\;\;
  =
  \;\;\;
  \array{
     P_x &\stackrel{tra(\gamma' \circ \gamma)}{\to}& P_z
     \\
     x &\stackrel{\gamma'\circ \gamma}{\to}& z
  }



In other words, a connection on PP is a functor
tra:P 1(X)→At″(P)
  tra : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to At''(P)


from the path groupoid of XX to the Atiyah Lie groupoid of PP that is smooth in a suitable sense and splits the Atiyah sequence in that P 1(X)→traAt″(X)→P 1(X)\mathbf{P}_1(X) \stackrel{tra}{\to} At''(X) \to \mathbf{P}_1(X) (see the notation at Atiyah Lie groupoid).
Terminology
The functor tratra is called the parallel transport of the connection. This terminology comes from looking at the orbits of all points in PP under tratra (i.e. from looking at the category of elements of tratra): these trace out paths in PP sitting over paths in XX and one thinks of the image of a point p∈P xp \in P_x under tra(γ)tra(\gamma) as the result of propagating pp parallel to these curves in PP.
Flat connections
It may happen that the assignment tra:γ↦tra(γ)tra : \gamma \mapsto tra(\gamma) only depends on the homotopy class of the path γ\gamma relative to its endpoints x,yx, y. In other words: that tratra factors through the functor P 1(X)→Π 1(X)P_1(X) \to \Pi_1(X) from the path groupoid to the fundamental groupoid of XX. In that case the connection is called a flat connection.
More concrete picture
By Lie differentiation the functor tratra, i.e. by looking at what it does to very short pieces of paths, one obtains from it a splitting of the Atiyah Lie algebroid sequence, which is a morphism
∇:TX→at(P)
  \nabla : T X \to at(P)


of vector bundles. Locally on XX – meaning: when everything is pulled back to a cover Y→XY \to X of XX – this is a Lie(G)Lie(G)-valued 1-form A∈Ω 1(Y,Lie(G))A \in \Omega^1(Y, Lie(G)) with certain special properties.
In particular, since every GG-principal bundle canonically trivializes when pulled back to its own total space PP, a connection in this case gives rise to a 1-form A∈Ω 1(P)A \in \Omega^1(P) satisfying two conditions. This data is called an Ehresmann connection.
If instead P=EP = E is a vector bundle, then the two conditions satisfies by AA imply that it defines a linear map
∇:Γ(E)→Ω 1(X,E):=Γ(X,T X *⊗E)
  \nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Omega^1(X,E):=\Gamma(X,T_X^*\otimes E)


from the space Γ(E)\Gamma(E) of section of EE that satisfies the properties of a covariant derivative.
If again the connection is flat, then this is manifestly the datum of a Lie infinity-algebroid representation of the tangent Lie algebroid TXT X of XX on EE: it defines the action Lie algebroid which is the Lie version of the Lie groupoid classified by the parallel transport functor.
…
More abstract picture
Recall from the discussion at GG-principal bundle that the GG-bundle P→XP \to X is encoded in a a suitable morphism
X→BG
  X \to \mathbf{B}G


(namely a morphism in the right (infinity,1)-category which may be represented by an anafunctor).
It turns out that similarly suitable morphisms
P 1(X)→BG
  \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


encode in one step the GG-bundle together with its parallel transport functor.
This is described in great detail in the reference by Schreiber–Waldorf below.
(…am running out of time… )
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Physical bodies interact. The effects of binary interactions between point particles are known to be summarizable in vector quantities called forces applied to any body in an interaction; namely the forces on one body from each of several other bodies add up as vectors and such vector sum of forces on the body is proportional to the acceleration of the body (hence Newton's second law F=maF = m a is not a definition of force but a real law).
Thus force is a vector-like quantity which is a manifestation of the interaction between bodies. If body AA acts with force FF on body BB then BB acts on AA with the force −F-F of the opposite vector value. These two forces do not cancel as they act on different bodies and at different points in space, though they are along the same line.
Sometimes one abstracts the forces on a system of bodies from the background by “potential energy” of the particles. Then the background acts on each particle with a force equal to the negative gradient of the potential energy.
In quantum field theory the forces appear mediated by particles which get exchanged between the bodies in interaction. For example, the strong nuclear force is mediated by gluons. There are 4 known fundamental forces in nature and all others are derived from them: the electromagnetic, weak, strong and gravitational force; and the first three are unified in the standard model of particle physics.
In nuclei there are also effective forces which are not of vector but of tensorial nature, and effective forces involving more than two bodies. But such quantum systems are far from classical mechanical systems.
Explicitly
A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.


See at dependent product – In terms of spaces of sections for more on this.
Traditional
Given a right principal GG-bundle π:P→X\pi: P\to X and a left GG-action on some FF, all in a sufficiently strong category CC (such as Top), one can form the quotient object P× GF=(P×F)/∼P \times_G F = (P\times F)/{\sim}, where P×FP \times F is a product and ∼\sim is the smallest congruence such that (using generalized elements) (pg,f)∼(p,gf)(p g,f)\sim (p,g f); there is a canonical projection P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X where the class of (p,f)(p,f) is mapped to π(p)∈X\pi(p)\in X, hence making P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X into a fibre bundle with typical fiber FF, and the transition functions belonging to the action of GG on FF. We say that P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X is the associated bundle to P→XP\to X with fiber FF.
In geometric homotopy theory
In the context of higher topos theory there is an elegant and powerful definition and construction of associated bundles. We discuss here some basics and how this recovers the traditional definition. For more see at associated infinity-bundle and at geometry of physics – representations and associated bundles.
At geometry of physics – principal bundles in the section Smooth principal bundles via smooth groupoids is discussed how smooth principal bundles for a Lie group GG over a smooth manifold XX are equivalently the homotopy fibers of morphisms of smooth groupoids (smooth stacks) of the form
X⟶BG.
  X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \mathbf{B}G
  \,.


Now given an action ρ\rho of GG on some smooth manifold VV, and regarding this action via its action groupoid projection p ρ:V//G→BGp_\rho \colon V//G \to \mathbf{B}G as discussed above, then we may consider these two morphisms into BG\mathbf{B}G jointly
  V//G   ↓ p ρ X ⟶g BG
  \array{
    && V//G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_\rho}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}G
  }


and so it is natural to construct their homotopy fiber product.
We now discuss that this is equivalently the associated bundle which is associated to the principal bundle P→XP \to X via the action ρ\rho.

Proposition
For GG a smooth group (e.g. a Lie group), XX a smooth manifold, P→XP \to X a smooth GG-principal bundle over XX and ρ\rho a smooth action of GG on some smooth manifold VV, then the associated VV-fiber bundle P× GV→XP \times_G V\to X is equivalently (regarded as a smooth groupoid) the homotopy pullback of the action groupoid-projection p ρ:V//G→BGp_\rho \colon V//G \to \mathbf{B}G along a morphism g:X→BGg \colon X\to\mathbf{B}G which modulates PP
P× GV ⟶ V//G ↓  ↓ p ρ X ⟶g BG.
  \array{
    P\times_G V &\longrightarrow& V//G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_\rho}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.



Proof
By the discussion at geometry of physics – principal bundles in the section Smooth principal bundles via smooth groupoids, the morphism gg of smooth groupoids is presented by a morphism of pre-smooth groupoids after choosing an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} over wich PP trivialize and choosing a trivialization, by the zig-zag
C({U i}) • ⟶g • (BG) • ↓ ≃ lwe X
  \array{
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet &\stackrel{g_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{lwe}}}
    \\
    X
  }


where the top morphism is the Cech cocycle of the given local trivialization regarded as a morphism out of the Cech groupoid of the given cover.
Moreover, by this proposition the morphism (p ρ) •(p_\rho)_\bullet is a global fibration of pre-smooth groupoids, hence, by the discussion at geometry of physics – smooth homotopy types, the homotopy pullback in question is equivalently computed as the ordinary pullback of pre-smooth groupoids of (p ρ) •(p_\rho)_\bullet along this g •g_\bullet
C({U i}) •×(BG) •(V//G) • ⟶ (V//G) • ↓  ↓ (p ρ) • C({U i}) • ⟶g • (BG) • ↓ ≃ lwe X.
  \array{
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet \underset{(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet}{\times} (V//G)_\bullet &\longrightarrow& (V//G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_\rho)_\bullet}}
    \\
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet &\stackrel{g_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}&
    (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{lwe}}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.


This pullback is computed componentwise. Hence it is the pre-smooth groupoid whose morphisms are pairs consisting of a morphism (x,i)→(x,j)(x,i)\to (x,j) in the Cech groupoid as well as a morphism s→gρ(s)(g)s \stackrel{g}{\to} \rho(s)(g) in the action groupoid, such that the group label gg of the latter equals the cocycle g ij(x)g_{i j}(x) of the cocycle on the former. Schematically:
C({U i}) •×(BG) •(V//G) •={((x,i),s)⟶g ij(x)((x,j),ρ(s)(g))}.
  C(\{U_i\})_\bullet \underset{(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet}{\times} (V//G)_\bullet
  =
  \left\{
     ((x,i),s) \stackrel{g_{i j}(x)}{\longrightarrow} ((x,j),\rho(s)(g))
  \right\}
  \,.


This means that the pullback groupoid has at most one morphism between every ordered pair of objects. Accordingly this groupoid is equivalence of groupoids equivalent to the quotient of its space of objects by the equivalence relation induced by its morphisms:
⋯≃(∐iU i×V)/ ∼.
  \cdots \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{i}{\coprod} U_i \times V
  \right)/_\sim
  \,.


This is a traditional description of the associated bundle in question.

In particle physics, matter is a bound state of fermionic particles.
This is in contrast to force fields, whose quanta are bosonic particles.
In the standard model of particle physics, all matter fields are sections of a spinor bundle on spacetime which is associated of a U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)-principal bundle.
In the standard model of cosmology matter is characterized as part of the energy-momentum density with specific parameter of state w=p/ρw = p/\rho, see at FRW model.
Geometric quantization is one formalization of the notion of quantization of a classical mechanical system/classical field theory to a quantum mechanical system/quantum field theory. In comparison to deformation quantization it focuses on spaces of states, hence on the Schrödinger picture of quantum mechanics.
Ingredients
With a symplectic manifold regarded as a classical mechanical system, geometric quantization produces quantization of this to a quantum mechanical system by


realize the symplectic form as the curvature of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection (which requires the form to have integral periods): called the prequantum circle bundle;


choose a polarization – a splitting of the abstract phase space into “coordinates” and “momenta”;


and then form


a Hilbert space of states as the space of sections of the associated line bundle which depend only on the “coordinates” (not on the “momenta”);


associate with every function on the symplectic manifold – every Hamiltonian – a linear operator on this Hilbert space.


History and variants
The approach is due to Alexandre Kirillov (“orbit method”), Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau. See the References below. It is closely related to Berezin quantization? and the subject of coherent states.

(Souriau 74, fig 1)
In a long term project Alan Weinstein and many of his students have followed the idea that the true story behind geometric quantization crucially involves symplectic Lie groupoids: higher symplectic geometry. See geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids for more on this.
More generally, there is higher geometric quantization.
Overview

This overview is taken from (Baez).

Geometric quantization is a tool for understanding the relation between classical physics and quantum physics. Here’s a brief sketch of how it goes.


We start with a classical phase space: mathematically, this is a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega.


Then we do prequantization: this gives us a Hermitian line bundle LL over XX, equipped with a U(1)U(1) connection DD whose curvature equals iωi \omega. LL is called the prequantum line bundle.
Warning: we can only do this step if ω\omega satisfies the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition, which says that ω/2π\omega/2\pi defines an integral cohomology class. If this condition holds, LL and DD are determined up to isomorphism, but not canonically.


The Hilbert space H 0H_0 of square-integrable sections of LL is called the prequantum Hilbert space. This is not yet the Hilbert space of our quantized theory – it’s too big. But it’s a good step in the right direction. In particular, we can prequantize classical observables: there’s a map sending any smooth function on XX to an operator on H 0H_0. This map takes Poisson brackets to commutators, just as one would hope. The formula for this map involves the connection DD.


To cut down the prequantum Hilbert space, we need to choose a polarization, say PP. What’s this? Well, for each point x∈Xx \in X, a polarization picks out a certain subspace P xP_x of the complexified tangent space at xx. We define the quantum Hilbert space, HH, to be the space of all square-integrable sections of LL that give zero when we take their covariant derivative at any point xx in the direction of any vector in P xP_x. The quantum Hilbert space is a subspace of the prequantum Hilbert space.
Warning: for PP to be a polarization, there are some crucial technical conditions we impose on the subspaces P xP_x. First, they must be isotropic: the complexified symplectic form ω\omega must vanish on them. Second, they must be Lagrangian: they must be maximal isotropic subspaces. Third, they must vary smoothly with xx. And fourth, they must be integrable.


The easiest sort of polarization to understand is a real polarization. This is where the subspaces P xP_x come from subspaces of the tangent space by complexification. It boils down to this: a real polarization is an integrable distribution PP on the classical phase space where each space P xP_x is Lagrangian subspace of the tangent space T xXT_x X.


To understand this rigamarole, one must study examples! First, it’s good to understand how good old Schrödinger quantization fits into this framework. Remember, in Schrödinger quantization we take our classical phase space XX to be the cotangent bundle T *MT^* M of a manifold MM called the classical configuration space. We then let our quantum Hilbert space be the space of all square-integrable functions on MM.
Modulo some technical trickery, we get this example when we run the above machinery and use a certain god-given real polarization on X=T *MX = T^*M, namely the one given by the vertical vectors.


It’s also good to study the Bargmann–Segal representation, which we get by taking X=ℂ nX = \mathbb{C}^n with its god-given symplectic structure (the imaginary part of the inner product) and using the god-given Kähler polarization. When we do this, our quantum Hilbert space consists of analytic functions on ℂ n\mathbb{C}^n which are square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure centered at the origin.


The next step is to quantize classical observables, turning them into linear operators on the quantum Hilbert space HH. Unfortunately, we can’t quantize all such observables while still sending Poisson brackets to commutators, as we did at the prequantum level. So at this point things get trickier and my brief outline will stop. Ultimately, the reason for this problem is that quantization is not a functor from the category of symplectic manifolds to the category of Hilbert spaces – but for that one needs to learn a bit about category theory.


Basic Jargon
Here are some definitions of important terms. Unfortunately they are defined using other terms that you might not understand. If you are really mystified, you need to read some books on differential geometry and the math of classical mechanics before proceeding.


complexification: We can tensor a real vector space with the complex numbers and get a complex vector space; this process is called complexification. For example, we can complexify the tangent space at some point of a manifold, which amounts to forming the space of complex linear combinations of tangent vectors at that point.


distribution: The word “distribution” means many different things in mathematics, but here’s one: a “distribution” VV on a manifold XX is a choice of a subspace V xV_x of each tangent space T pXT_p X, where the choice depends smoothly on xx.


Hamiltonian vector field: Given a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega, any smooth function f:X→ℝf: X \to \mathbb{R} can be thought of as a “Hamiltonian”, meaning physically that we think of it as the energy function and let it give rise to a flow on XX describing the time evolution of states. Mathematically speaking, this flow is generated by a vector field v(f)v(f) called the “Hamiltonian vector field” associated to ff. It is the unique vector field such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-, v(f)) = d f


In other words, for any vector field uu on XX we have
ω(u,v(f))=df(u)=uf
  \omega(u,v(f)) = d f(u) = u f


The vector field v(f)v(f) is guaranteed to exist by the fact that ω\omega is nondegenerate.


integrable distribution: A distribution of subspaces of the tangent bundle on a smooth manifold XX is “integrable” if at least locally, there is a foliation of XX by submanifolds such that V xV_x is the tangent space of the submanifold containing the point xx.


integral cohomology class: Any closed differential p-form on a smooth manifold MM defines an element of the ppth de Rham cohomology of MM. This is a finite-dimensional vector space, and it contains a lattice called the ppth integral cohomology group of MM. We say a cohomology class is integral if it lies in this lattice. Most notably, if you take any U(1)U(1) connection on any Hermitian line bundle over MM, its curvature 22-form will define an integral cohomology class once you divide it by 2πi2 \pi i. This cohomology class is called the first Chern class, and it serves to determine the line bundle up to isomorphism.


Poisson brackets: Given a symplectic structure on a manifold MM and given two smooth functions on that manifold, say ff and gg, there’s a trick for getting a new smooth function {f,g}\{f,g\} on the manifold, called the Poisson bracket of ff and gg.
This trick works as follows: given any smooth function ff we can take its differential dfd f, which is a 11-form. Then there is a unique vector field v(f)v(f), the Hamiltonian vector field associated to ff, such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-,v(f)) = d f


Using this we define
{f,g}=ω(v(f),v(g))
   \{f,g\} = \omega(v(f),v(g))
 

It’s easy to check that we also have {f,g}=dg(v(f))=v(f)g\{f,g\} = d g(v(f)) = v(f) g. So {f,g}\{f,g\} says how much gg changes as we differentiate it in the direction of the Hamiltonian vector field generated by ff.
In the familiar case where MM is ℝ 2n\mathbb{R}^{2n} with momentum and position coordinates p ip_i, q iq_i, the Poisson brackets of ff and gg work out to be
{f,g}=∑ idfdp idgdq i−dfdq idgdp i
   \{f,g\} = \sum_i \frac{d f}{d p_i} \frac{d g}{d q_i} - \frac{d f}{d q_i}\frac{d g}{d p_i}
 


square-integrable sections: We can define an inner product on the sections of a Hermitian line bundle over a manifold XX with a symplectic structure. The symplectic structure defines a volume form which lets us do the necessary integral. A section whose inner product with itself is finite is said to be square-integrable. Such sections form a Hilbert space H 0H_0 called the “prequantum Hilbert space”. It is a kind of preliminary version of the Hilbert space we get when we quantize the classical system whose phase space is XX.


symplectic structure: A symplectic structure on a manifold MM is a closed 22-form ω\omega which is nondegenerate in the sense that for any nonzero tangent vector uu at any point of MM, there is a tangent vector uu at that point for which w(u,v)w(u,v) is nonzero.


U(1)U(1) connection: The group U(1)U(1) is the group of unit complex numbers. Given a complex line bundle LL with an inner product on each fiber L xL_x, a U(1)U(1) connection on LL is a connection such that parallel translation preserves the inner product.


vertical vectors: Given a bundle EE over a manifold MM, we say a tangent vector to some point of EE is vertical if it projects to zero down on MM.


Geometric quantization involves two steps


Geometric prequantization


Geometric quantization proper.


Geometric prequantization
Prequantum line bundle
Given the symplectic form ω\omega, a prequantum circle bundle for it is a circle bundle with connection whose curvature is ω\omega.
In other words, prequantization is a lift of ω\omega through the curvature-exact sequence of ordinary differential cohomology (see there).
The multiple of the Chern class of this line bundle is identified with the inverse Planck constant.
Prequantum states
A prequantum state is a section of the prequantum bundle.
This becomes a quantum state or wavefunction if polarized (…).
Prequantum operators
Let ∇:X→BU(1) conn\nabla : X \to \mathbf{B} U(1)_{conn} be a prequantum line bundle E→XE \to X with connection for ω\omega. Write Γ X(E)\Gamma_X(E) for its space of smooth sections, the prequantum space of states.

Definition
(prequantum operators)
For f∈C ∞(X,ℂ)f \in C^\infty(X, \mathbb{C}) a function on phase space, the corresponding quantum operator is the linear map
f^:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)
  \hat f \colon \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)


given by
(1)ψ↦−i∇ v fψ+f⋅ψ,
  
  \psi \mapsto -i \nabla_{v_f} \psi + f \cdot \psi
  \,,


where


v fv_f is the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to ff;


∇ v f:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)\nabla_{v_f} : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the covariant derivative of sections along v fv_f for the given choice of prequantum connection;


f⋅(−):Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)f \cdot (-) : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the operation of degreewise multiplication pf sections.




Remark
(origin of the formulas for prequantum operators)+
The formula (1) may look a bit mysterious on first sight. The correction term to the covariant derivative appearing in this formula is ultimately due to the fact that with vv the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to a Hamiltonian H vH_v via
ι vω=dH v
  \iota_v \omega = d H_v


then the Lie derivative of θ\theta (the symplectic potentiation, related by dθ=ωd \theta = \omega) is
ℒ vθ=dH˜ v
  \mathcal{L}_v \theta = d \tilde H_v


for
H˜ v=H v+ι vθ.
  \tilde H_v = H_v + \iota_v \theta
  \,.


Here the second term on the right is what yields the covariant derivative in (1), while the first summand is the correction term in (1).
A derivation of these formulas from first principles is given in (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13a, example 3.2.3 and remark 3.3.16).

Geometric quantization
Given a prequantum bundle as above, the actual step of genuine geometric quantization consists first of forming half its space of sections in a certain sense. Physically this means passing to the space of wavefunctions that depend only on canonical positions but not on canonical momenta. Second, subgroups of the group of (exponentiated) prequantum operators are made to descend to this space of quantum states, these are the quantum operators or quantum observables.
Quantum states
Historically, the traditional way to formalize the formation of the space of quantum states is as a 3-step process


choose a Polarization;


choose a Metaplectic correction;


form the induced space of quantum states as the space of polarized sections of the prequantum line bundle tensored a certain half-form bundle.


This we discuss at

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections

This traditional route via polarizations and metaplectic corrections has the disadvantage that mathematically it is not a very natural operation. However, under mild conditions it turns out to be equivalent to the following mathematically very natural construction


choose a KU-orientation, hence a spin^c structure of XX compatible with the given prequantum bundle;


take the space of quantum states to be the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point, hence the index of the spin^c Dirac operator twisted by the prequantum line bundle.


This general geometric quantization by push-forward is discussed below at

Quantum space of states as index of a Dirac operator.

In the special case that the prequantum line bundle admits a Kähler polarization this push-forward quantization has a direct expression in terms of the complex abelian sheaf cohomology and of the Dolbeault operator of the prequantum holomorphic line bundle. Now the choice of metaplectic correction is precisely a spin structure (a “Theta characteristic”) and the index is now that of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator which is equivalently just the Euler characteristic of the holomorphic abelian sheaf cohomology of the prequantum line bundle. This complex Dolbeault quantization case we discuss in

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology

and

Quantum state space as index of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections
For (X,ω)(X, \omega) a symplectic manifold, choose a Kähler polarization, hence an involutive Lagrangian subbundle 𝒫⊂T 𝒞X\mathcal{P} \subset T_{\mathcal{C}} X such that 𝒫∩𝒫¯=0\mathcal{P} \cap \overline{\mathcal{P}} = 0. Choose moreover a metaplectic correction of 𝒫\mathcal{P}. This defines the half-density bundle Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} along 𝒫\mathcal{P}.
Let now (L,∇)(L,\nabla) be a prequantum line bundle for (X,ω)(X,\omega).

Definition
The space of quantum states of the prequantum bundle defined by the choice of Kähler polarization 𝒫\mathcal{P} and metaplectic correction Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} is the space of sections of the tensor product L⊗Ω𝒫L \otimes \sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} which are covariant derivative covariantly constant with respect to ∇\nabla along 𝒫¯\overline{\mathcal{P}} and square integrable with respect to the induced integration over X/𝒫¯X/\overline{\mathcal{P}}:
ℋ pol:L 2({ψ∈Γ(L⊗Ω𝒫)|∇ 𝒫¯ψ=0}).
  \mathcal{H}_{pol}
  \colon
  L^2
  \left(
  \left\{
   \psi \in \Gamma(L \otimes \sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}})
   \;|\;
   \nabla_{\overline{\mathcal{P}}} \psi = 0
  \right\}
  \right)
  \,.


For instance (Bates-Weinstein, def. 7.17).

Remark
In the case of Kähler polarization it is useful to write Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0} for the canonical line bundle of the polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} for the corresponding choice of metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology
Let (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a compact topological space symplectic manifold, L ωL_\omega a prequantum line bundle, 𝒫\mathcal{P} a Kähler polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} a metaplectic correction.

Definition
The corresponding Euler quantum Hilbert space is the virtual vector space
ℋ Euler≔⨁ k=0 n(−1) kH 0,k(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0),
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \coloneqq
  \bigoplus_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k \, H^{0,k}(X,L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}})
  \,,


which is the alternating direct sum of the Dolbeault cohomology space of XX with coefficients in the tensor product L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the prequantum line bundle with the metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.


Remark
The Kodaira vanishing theorem asserts that if L ωΩ n,0 −1L_\omega \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1} is a positive line bundle then all the higher cohomology groups in the above expression vanish. Therefore in this case the definition coincides with that via polarizations in def.  above.
(L ω⊗Ω n,0 −1positive)⇒(ℋ pol≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(
    L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1}
    \;
    positive
  \right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left(
    \mathcal{H}_{pol} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


Quantum state space as index of Dolbeault-Dirac operator
Suppose again that (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is equipped with a Kähler polarization.
We need the following general fact on spin structures over Kähler manifolds.

Proposition
A choice of spin structure on the Kähler manifold XX (of real dimension 2n2n) is equivalently a choice of square root (“Theta characteristic”) Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the canonical line bundle Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0}.
Given such a choice, there is a natural isomorphism between the spinor bundle S XS_X and the (anti-)holomorphic form bundle tensored by this square root
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0.
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
 \,.


Finally, the corresponding Dirac operator is the Dolbeault-Dirac operator ∂¯+∂¯ *\overline{\partial} + \overline{\partial}^\ast.

See at spin structure – Over a Kähler manifold.

Remark
It follows that the Dirac operator on XX which is twisted by the connection ∇\nabla on the prequantum holomorphic line bundle L ωL_\omega is of the form
∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *:Ω 0,even/odd(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0)→Ω 0,odd/even(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0).
  \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}^\ast_\nabla
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^{0,even/odd}\left(X, \;L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \to 
  \Omega^{0,odd/even}\left(X, \; L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \,.


Observe how from the point of view of just the Dolbeault operator, this is twisting not just by the prequantum line bundle itself but by the metaplectically corrected prequantum line bundle L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}, while from the point of view of the Dirac operator it is just twisting by L ωL_\omega, since tensoring with the square root line bundle Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} induces the isomorphism between the antiholomorphic differential form bundle and the actual spinor bundle over the Kähler manifold.


Definition
The Dolbeault-Dirac space of quantum states of (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is the index of the L ωL_\omega-twisted Dolbeault-Dirac operator (the Todd genus)
ℋ DolbDir≔index(∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *).
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDir} 
    \coloneqq
  index( \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}_\nabla^\ast )
  \,.



Remark
This definition agrees with that by abelian sheaf cohomology in def. 
ℋ Euler≃ℋ DolbDirac.
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac}
  \,.



Remark
What before in the quantization prescription by polarization and by abelian sheaf cohomology was the “metaplectic correction” introduced “by hand” is now naturally part of the isomorphism of prop.  which identifies the Dirac operator with the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state spaces as index of the Spin cSpin^c-Dirac operator
Finally we come to the true definition of geometric quantization, the most general and at the same time most natural one which contains the above as special cases.
The actual definition is def.  below. Here we lead up to it by spelling out the ingredients.
We need the following general facts about spin^c Dirac operators.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the spin^c-Lie group Spin c(n)Spin^c(n) is equivalently


the tensor product of the ordinary spin group Spin(n)Spin(n) with the circle group over the group of order 2
Spin c≃Spin(n)×ℤ 2U(1)
  Spin^c \simeq Spin(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1)



the loop space object
Spin c≃ΩBSpin c
  Spin^c \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B} Spin^c


of the homotopy fiber product of the universal smooth second Stiefel-Whitney class and the mod-2 reduction of the universal first Chern class in smooth infinity-groupoids:
BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ ⇙ ≃ ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod \, 2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.



Here the top horizontal map is called the universal determinant line bundle map.

See at spin^c group for more details.

Remark
It follows that if we represent elements of Spin c(n)≃SO(n)×ℤ 2U(1)Spin^c(n) \simeq SO(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1) as equivalence classes of pairs (g,c)(g,c), then the determinant line bundle map of def.  is given by
det:(g,c)↦2c,
  det \;\colon \; (g,c) \mapsto 2c
  \,,


where on the right we write the group operation in the abelian group U(1)U(1) additively.
This factor of 2 on the right is crucial in all of the following.


Definition
Let XX be an oriented smooth manifold. A smooth spin^c structure on XX is a lift τ^ X\hat \tau_X of the classifying map τ X:X→BSO(n)\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B} SO(n) of its tangent bundle through the left vertical map in def. 
  BSpin c(n)   τ^ X↗ ↓ X →τ X BSO(n).
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}SO(n)
  }
  \,.



Remark
In words this says that a spin^c structure on an oriented manifold XX is a choice of circle group-principal bundle or equivalenty of hermitian complex line bundle such that its first Chern class modulo 2 equals the second Stiefel-Whitney class w 2w_2 of XX. If this second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes (as an element in H 2(X,ℤ 2)H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)) this means that XX has a genuine spin structure. So in other words whenever the determinant line bundle of a spin^c structure (in the sens of def. ) has a first Chern class that is divisible by 2, then there is an actual spin^c structure.
We can formalize this statement as follows: there is a commuting square of the form
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →((2⋅)∘p 2 BU(1) ↓  ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}( Spin(n) \times U(1) ) &\stackrel{((2 \cdot)\circ p_2}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}U(1)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod\, 2}}
     \\
     \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}^2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }


similar to the one in def.  but crucially different in that here we have just the cartesian product of Spin(n)Spin(n) with U(1)U(1) in the top left. In the standard presentation of these objects this diagram commutes on the nose (filled by a canonical homotopy) simply because both ways to go from the top left to the bottom right hit 0∈ℤ 20 \in \mathbb{Z}_2: the left-bottom one because BSpin(n)\mathbf{B}Spin(n) is essentially by definition such that the second SW class trivializes on it, and the top-right one because first multiplying by 2 and then reducing mod 2 is 0.
Since the diagram commutes, the universal property of the above homotopy pullback says that there is a canonically induced map
(p 1,p 2):Spin(n)×U(1)→Spin c(n).
  (p_1, p_2) \;\colon\; Spin(n) \times U(1) \to Spin^c(n)
  \,.


Of course this is just the evident quotient projection which on elements is simply the identity
(g,c)↦(g,c),
  (g,c) \mapsto (g,c)
  \,,


only that on the right we regard the pair (g,c)(g,c) as a placeholder for its equivalence class in the tensor product over ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2.
Moreover, the universal property of the homotopy pullback says that every spin^c structure τ^ c\hat \tau_c whose underlying determinant line bundle is such that its first Chern class is divisible by 2 actually factors through this map, hence that it is just the product of an ordinary SpinSpin-principal bundle with a circle bundle.
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →p 2 BU(1)  (p 1,p 2)↓  ↓ B(2⋅) BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ (pb) ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}(Spin(n) \times U(1)) &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(p_1,p_2)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathbf{B}(2 \cdot)}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c_1\,mod\,2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.


This is the crucial relation by which the K-theoretic quantization will harmonize with the above Euler- and Dolbeault- quantization, discussed below.


Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} an even number, write
Δ n≃ℂ 2 n/2
  \Delta_n \simeq \mathbb{C}^{2^{n/2}}


for the canonical complex spin representation, which decomposes into two chiral irreducible representations
Δ n≃Δ n +⊕Δ n −.
  \Delta_n \simeq \Delta_n^+ \oplus \Delta_n^-
  \,.


Then the canonical spin^c-representation
ρ:Spin c(n)×Δ n→Δ n
  \rho \colon Spin^c(n) \times \Delta_n \to \Delta_n


is the one given in the components of remark  by
((g,c),ψ)↦(g(ψ))⋅c
  ((g,c), \psi) \mapsto (g(\psi)) \cdot c


(first act with the spin-component in the usual way and then multiply by c∈U(1)↪ℂc \in U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}).

As discussed at representation we may think of this as a morphism of smooth groupoids (stacks) of the form
ρ:BSpin c(n)→ℂMod≃ℂVect.
  \rho \colon \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n) \to \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Mod} \simeq \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.



Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X:X→BSpin c(n)\hat \tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n), def. , the associated spinor bundle is the one modulated by
S c:X→τ^ XBSpin c(n)→ρℂVect.
  S^c
  \colon
  X \stackrel{\hat \tau_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n)
  \stackrel{\rho}{\to} \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.


Crucial for the comparison of the K-theoretic quantization to be defined in a moment and the above Euler/Dolbeault quantization is the following:

Remark
By remark  it follows that in the case that the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure is divisible by 2, hence in the case that c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2∈H 2(X,ℤ 2)c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \in H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2), then the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle of def.  is just the tensor product of the ordinary underlying spinor bundle with half the determinant line bundle:
(c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2)⇒(S c≃S⊗det(τ^ X)).
  \left( c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(S^c \simeq S \otimes \sqrt{det(\hat \tau_X)}\right)
  \,.


Let now (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a (pre-)symplectic manifold and let (L ω,∇)(L_{\omega}, \nabla) be a prequantum line bundle.

Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X\hat \tau_X on XX whose underlying determinant line bundle coincides, up to equivalence, with (L ω) ⊗ 2(L_\omega)^{\otimes^2}, then the spin^c quantization of this prequantum data is the index of the corresponding spin^c Dirac operator D cD_{\mathbf{c}}:
ℋ K≔index(D c).
  \mathcal{H}_{K} \coloneqq index(D_{\mathbf{c}})
  \,.



Remark
This is equivalently the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point.
Moreover, on cocycles this push-forward is expressed by the traditional construction of Hilbert spaces of quantum states:
let XX be a manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric, a spinor bundle and a Dirac operator D:Γ(S)→Γ(S)D \colon \Gamma(S) \to \Gamma(S). Then the corresponding K-homology cycle is:


the Hilbert space L 2(S)L^2(S) of square integrable sections of the spinor bundle;


equipped with the action by fiberwise multiplication of the C*-algebra C 0(X)C_0(X) of functions vanishing at infinity
C 0(X)→ℬ(L 2(S))
  C_0(X) \to \mathcal{B}(L^2(S))


(which is by bounded operators)


and equipped with the Dirac operator DD as the ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded Fredholm operator defining the K-homology class.


Together with is equivalent an element
[D,L 2(S)]∈KK(C 0(X),ℂ).
  [D, L^2(S)] \in KK(C_0(X), \mathbb{C})
  \,.


Postcomposition of K-theory classes [ξ]∈KK(ℂ,C 0(X))[\xi] \in KK(\mathbb{C}, C_0(X)) with this map is the push-forward/index map in K-theory.


Remark
This definition does not assume any choice of polarization, nor any choice of complex structure etc. On the other hand, every choice of almost complex structure (hence in particular of Kähler polarization) does induce a spin^c structure, as discussed there. See also (Borthwick-Uribe 96).

So then we can compare:

Proposition
If a choice of Kähler polarization exists on the compact prequantum geometry (X,L ω)(X,L_\omega), then the K-theoretic quantization of def.  coincides with the Dolbeault-Dirac quantization of def.  and hence, by remark , with the Euler-characteristic definition, def. , so that all the respectives spaces of quantum states agree:
((X,ω)Kaehler)⇒(ℋ K≃ℋ DolbDirac≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(\left(X,\omega\right) \; Kaehler\right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
  \mathcal{H}_K 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac} 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


This is to some extent discussed for instance in (Hochs 08, lemma 3.32, Paradan 09, prop. 2.2).

Proof
Let Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} be a choice of square root (Theta characteristic) of the canonical line bundle, which according to  is a choice of spin structure in the Kähler manifold. Then by that same proposition the corresponding spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}


and so the corresponding L ωL_\omega-twisted spinor bundle is
S⊗L ω ≃(Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0)⊗L ω  ≃Ω 0,•⊗(Ω n,0⊗L ω),
  \begin{aligned}
   S \otimes L_\omega & \simeq
   \left(\Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
    \otimes L_\omega
    \\
    & \simeq
   \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \left(\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
    \otimes L_\omega\right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,


where we have re-bracheted just for emphasis of how the metaplectic correction appears as part of the spinor bundle.
At the same time, by remark  we have that under this assumption that an actual spin structure exists, the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S c≃S⊗L ω.
  S^c \simeq S \otimes L_\omega
  \,.


So the two spinor bundles agree. It is now sufficient to observe that under this identification both the Dolbeault-Dirac operator as well as the spin^c Dirac operator have the same symbol to conclude that they have the same index.


Remark
The assumption in the above that we do have a spin structure is only for comparison with the Euler-/ Dolbeault-quantization. It is not necessary for the K-theoretic geometric quantization by spin^c structure.
In the general case the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure may not admit a square root. (Its failure of having a square root will be compensated precisely by the failure of there being a genuine spin structure.) Still, by the above discussion the index of the corresponding spin^c structure is like a quantization of a would-be square root of the determinant line bundle in this case.

Quantum operators / observables
Given a Hamiltonian action on the symplectic manifold by a Lie group GG, we can apply the above K-theoretic quantization by push-foward in GG-equivariant K-theory, to
K G(*)≃K(*//G)≃R(G)
  K_G(\ast) \simeq K(\ast//G) \simeq R(G)


This is the representation ring of GG and hence yields not just a Hilbert space, but a Hilbert space equipped with a GG-action. This is the action by quantum operators, quantizing the GG-actions. Generalized orientation theory give the necessary condition for this quantization to exist: XX needs to be oriented not just in K-theory (spin^c structure) but in GG-equivariant K-theory (equivariant spin^c structure).
So the geometric quantization of observables is essentially what mathematically is known as Dirac induction.

In physics the dynamics of a physical system may be encoded by a nonlinear functional – called the action functional – on its configuration space:


in classical mechanics and classical field theory – by the action principle or principle of least action – the extrema of the action functional – obtained by variational calculus and given by Euler-Lagrange equations – encode the physically observable configurations ;


in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory the evolution of the quantum states is encoded by the integral – the path integral – of the exponentiated action functional over the space of field configurations.


For emphasis the description of dynamics by action functionals is called the Lagrangean approach. Another formulation of dynamics in physics that does not involve an action functional explicitly is Hamiltonian mechanics on phase space. At least in certain classes of cases the relation and equivalence of both approaches is understood. Generally the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of action functionals suffers from a lack of precise understanding of what the path integral over the action functional really means.

Let H\mathbf{H} be the ambient (∞,1)-topos with a natural numbers object and equipped with an additive continuum line object 𝔸 1\mathbb{A}^1 (see there). Let C∈HC \in \mathbf{H} be the configuration space of a physical system. Then an action functional is a morphism
exp(iℏS(−)):C→𝔸 1/ℤ
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 / \mathbb{Z}
  \,


(here ℏ\hbar refers to Planck's constant).
If H\mathbf{H} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos then there is an intrinsic differential of the action functional to a morphism
dexp(iℏS(−)):C→♭ dR𝔸 1/ℤ.
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) : C \to \mathbf{\flat}_{dR}\mathbb{A}^1/\mathbb{Z}
  \,.


The equation
dexp(iℏS(−))=0  
  \mathbf{d} \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S(-)) = 0


is the Euler-Lagrange equation of the system. It characterizes the critical locus of SS is the covariant phase space inside the configuration space: the space of classically realized trajectories/histories of the system. If H\mathbf{H} models derived geometry then this critical locus is presented by a BRST-BV complex.
Local action functionals (traditional theory)
An action functional is called local if it arises from integration of a Lagrangian.
In traditional theory this is interpreted as follows: an action functional S:C→𝔸 1S : C \to \mathbb{A}^1 is called local if


the configuration space CC is the space C=Γ X(E)C = \Gamma_X(E) of sections of a fiber bundle E→XE \to X over some parameter space (spacetime XX);


there is a Lagrangian density J ∞(E)→Ω dimX(X)J_\infty(E) \to \Omega^{\dim X}(X) on the jet bundle of EE;


on a section/field configuration ϕ:X→E\phi : X \to E the action SS takes the value
S(ϕ)=∫ XL(j ∞(ϕ)),
  S(\phi) = \int_X L(j_\infty(\phi))
  \,,


where j ∞(ϕ)=(ϕ,∂ iϕ,⋯)j_\infty(\phi) = (\phi, \partial_i \phi, \cdots) is the jet-prolongation of ϕ\phi (the collection of all its higher partial derivatives).


Consider action functional for on a configuration space of smooth functions from the line to a smooth manifold XX.
We can consider

S(q)=∫ a bL(q,q˙)dt S(q) = \int_a^b L(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}t , where qq is a path through configuration space, on the time interval [a,b][a,b], with derivative q˙=dq/dt\dot{q} = \mathrm{d}q/\mathrm{d}t. When minimising the action, we fix the values of q(a)q(a) and q(b)q(b).
L(q,q˙)=∫ Sℒ(q,q˙)dxdydz L(q,\dot{q}) = \int_{S} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z , where now qq is a configuration of fields on SS, which is a region of space. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of SS (typically that qq and q˙\dot{q} go to zero if SS is all of space).
S(q)=∫ Rℒ(q,q˙)dxdydzdt S(q) = \int_{R} \mathcal{L}(q,\dot{q}) \,\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t , where now qq is a configuration of fields on RR, which a region of spacetime, with time derivative q˙=∂q/∂t\dot{q} = \partial{q}/\partial{t}. We fix boundary conditions on the boundary of RR.

The formulation of (3) above is still not manifestly coordinate independent. However, dxdydzdt\mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y\,\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}t is simply the volume form on spacetime and q˙\dot{q} is merely one choice of coordinate on state space and could just as easily be replaced by a derivative with respect to any timelike coordinate on spacetime (or drop coordinates altogether).
Extended local action functionals in (higher) gauge theory
For gauge theories and higher gauge theories the configuration spaces of the physical system are in general not plain manifolds or similar, but are orbifolds or more generally smooth groupoids, smooth ∞-groupoids. (An exposition of and introduction to much of the following is at geometry of physics.)
For instance for GG a Lie group and BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} the smooth moduli stack of GG-principal connections (see at connection on a bundle), then the smooth groupoid of GG-gauge field configurations is the internal hom/mapping stack [Σ,BG conn]∈[\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \in Smooth∞Grpd (or some concretification thereof, see at geometric of physics – differential moduli: this is the smooth groupoid whose objects are GG-gauge field-configurations on Σ\Sigma (connections on GG-principal bundles over Σ\Sigma), and whose morphisms are gauge transformations between these. The infinitesimal approximation to this smooth ∞-groupoid, its ∞-Lie algebroid is the (off-shell) BRST complex of the theory. The tangent to the nn-fold higher gauge transformations becomes the nn-fold ghosts in the BRST complex.
More generally GG here can by any smooth ∞-group, such as the circle n-group B n−1U(1)\mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1) or the String 2-group or the Fivebrane 6-group, and so on, in which case [Σ,BG conn][\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] is the smooth ∞-groupoid of higher gauge field, gauge transformations between these, higher gauge transformations between those, and so on.
Notice that this means in particular that in higher geometry a gauge theory is a sigma-model quantum field theory: one whose target space is not just a plain manifold but is a moduli stack of gauge field configurations.
A gauge invariant action functional is then a morphism of smooth ∞-groupoids
exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]→U(1).
  \exp( i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] \to U(1)
  \,.


This is of particular interest, again, if it is local. In fact, in this context now we can also ask that it is “extended” in the sense of extended topological quantum field theory: that we have an action functional not only in top dimension, being a function, but also in codimension 1, being a prequantum bundle, and in higher codimension, being a prequantum n-bundle.
This is notably the case for all (higher) gauge theories of infinity-Chern-Simons theory type, such as ordinary Chern-Simons theory and such as ordinary Dijkgraaf-Witten theory, as well as its higher generalizations. In these cases the action functional exp(iS(−)):[Σ,BG conn]\exp(i S(-)) \colon [\Sigma, \mathbf{B}G_{conn}] arises itself from transgression of an extended Lagrangian that is defined on the universal moduli stack of gauge field configurations BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} itself, namely from a universal characteristic class in higher nonabelian differential cohomology of the form
L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn.
  \mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn}
  \,.


Here B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} is the universal smooth moduli infinity-stack for circle n-bundles with connection. Such a morphism of moduli stacks locally takes a connection differential form AA to a Chern-Simons form CS(A)CS(A), but globally it sends the underlying principal bundle to a circle (n-1)-group principal ∞-bundle and accordingly acts globally on the connection. This is hence a fully local Lagrangian: an extended Lagrangian. Alternatively, one may think of this whole morphism as modulating a prequantum circle n-bundle on the universal moduli stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} of gauge fields itself.
For instance for ordinary Chern-Simons theory here n=3n = 3 GG is a semisimple Lie group and L\mathbf{L} is a smooth and differential refinement of the first Pontryagin class/second Chern class, or of an integral multiple of that (the “level” of the theory). In this case L\mathbf{L} may also be thought of as modulating the universal Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. If instead GG is a discrete group then L\mathbf{L} is a cocycle in the U(1)U(1)-group cohomology and this is the extended Lagrangian of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory.
This extended Lagrangian becomes an extended action functional after transgression: the operation of fiber integration in ordinary differential cohomology refines to a morphism of moduli stacks of the form
exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−)):[Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→B n−kU(1) conn,
  \exp(2 \pi i \int_{\Sigma_k} (-))
  \colon
  [\Sigma_k, \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{\mathrm{conn}} ]
  \to 
  \mathbf{B}^{n-k}U(1)_{conn}
 \,,


where Σ\Sigma is an oriented closed manifold of dimension kk. This morphism locally simply takes a differential n-form to its ordinary integration of differential forms over Σ k\Sigma_k, but globally it takes the correct higher holonomy of circle n-bundles with connection.
Combining this with an extended ∞-Chern-Simons theory Lagrangian L:BG conn→B nU(1) conn\mathbf{L} \colon \mathbf{B}G_{conn} \to \mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} as above yields for each dimension kk a prequantum circle n-bundle on the space of gauge field configurations over Σ k\Sigma_k, by forming the transgression composite
exp(iS(−))≔exp(2πi∫ Σ k[Σ k,L]):[Σ k,BG conn]→[Σ k,L][Σ k,B nU(1) conn]→exp(2πi∫ Σ k(−))B n−kU(1) conn.

This morphism locally takes the local differential form incarnation AA of a connection on an ∞-bundle to the exponentiation of the integration of differential forms ∫ ΣCS(A)\int_\Sigma CS(A) of some higher Chern-Simons form, but globally it computes the correct higher holonomy of the higher circle n-bundle with connection over the universal moduli stack of fields, as modulated by the extended Lagrangian L\mathbf{L}.
Quantum field theory is the general framework for the description of the fundamental processes in physics as understood today. These are carried by configurations of fields under the generalized rules of quantum mechanics, therefore the name. Notably the standard model of particle physics is a quantum field theory and has been the main motivation for the development of the concept in general.
Historically quantum field theory grew out of attempts to combine classical field theory in the context of special relativity with quantum mechanics. While some aspects of it are understood in exceeding detail, the overall picture of what quantum field theory actually is used to be quite mysterious. There are two main approaches for axiomatizing and formalizing the notion:


algebraic quantum field theory: AQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of operator algebras “of observables” to patches of spacetime;


functorial quantum field theory: FQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of spaces of quantum states to patches of codimension 1, and of maps between spaces of states – the time evolution operator – to cobordisms between such patches.


Both these approaches try to capture the notion of a full quantum field theory. On the other hand, much activity in physics is concerned with perturbative quantum field theory. This is a priori to be thought of as an approximation to a full quantum field theory akin to the approximation of a function by its Taylor series, but not the least because it is often the only available technique, the tools of perturbative quantum field theory are to some extent also taken as a definition of quantum field theory.
The gap for instance between the formal study of the AQFT axioms and physics as done in practice by physicists had to a large extent been due to the fact that AQFT had little to say about perturbative quantum field theory. But recently this has been changing. See perturbative quantum field theory for more.
Recent times have seen major progress in understanding these axiomatizations and connecting them to the structures studied in physics (see the references below), but still the number of interesting phenomena in quantum field theory that physicists handle semi-rigorously and that are waiting for a fully formal understanding is large.
Geometric quantization is one formalization of the notion of quantization of a classical mechanical system/classical field theory to a quantum mechanical system/quantum field theory. In comparison to deformation quantization it focuses on spaces of states, hence on the Schrödinger picture of quantum mechanics.
Ingredients
With a symplectic manifold regarded as a classical mechanical system, geometric quantization produces quantization of this to a quantum mechanical system by


realize the symplectic form as the curvature of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection (which requires the form to have integral periods): called the prequantum circle bundle;


choose a polarization – a splitting of the abstract phase space into “coordinates” and “momenta”;


and then form


a Hilbert space of states as the space of sections of the associated line bundle which depend only on the “coordinates” (not on the “momenta”);


associate with every function on the symplectic manifold – every Hamiltonian – a linear operator on this Hilbert space.


History and variants
The approach is due to Alexandre Kirillov (“orbit method”), Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau. See the References below. It is closely related to Berezin quantization? and the subject of coherent states.

(Souriau 74, fig 1)
In a long term project Alan Weinstein and many of his students have followed the idea that the true story behind geometric quantization crucially involves symplectic Lie groupoids: higher symplectic geometry. See geometric quantization of symplectic groupoids for more on this.
More generally, there is higher geometric quantization.
Overview

This overview is taken from (Baez).

Geometric quantization is a tool for understanding the relation between classical physics and quantum physics. Here’s a brief sketch of how it goes.


We start with a classical phase space: mathematically, this is a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega.


Then we do prequantization: this gives us a Hermitian line bundle LL over XX, equipped with a U(1)U(1) connection DD whose curvature equals iωi \omega. LL is called the prequantum line bundle.
Warning: we can only do this step if ω\omega satisfies the Bohr–Sommerfeld condition, which says that ω/2π\omega/2\pi defines an integral cohomology class. If this condition holds, LL and DD are determined up to isomorphism, but not canonically.


The Hilbert space H 0H_0 of square-integrable sections of LL is called the prequantum Hilbert space. This is not yet the Hilbert space of our quantized theory – it’s too big. But it’s a good step in the right direction. In particular, we can prequantize classical observables: there’s a map sending any smooth function on XX to an operator on H 0H_0. This map takes Poisson brackets to commutators, just as one would hope. The formula for this map involves the connection DD.


To cut down the prequantum Hilbert space, we need to choose a polarization, say PP. What’s this? Well, for each point x∈Xx \in X, a polarization picks out a certain subspace P xP_x of the complexified tangent space at xx. We define the quantum Hilbert space, HH, to be the space of all square-integrable sections of LL that give zero when we take their covariant derivative at any point xx in the direction of any vector in P xP_x. The quantum Hilbert space is a subspace of the prequantum Hilbert space.
Warning: for PP to be a polarization, there are some crucial technical conditions we impose on the subspaces P xP_x. First, they must be isotropic: the complexified symplectic form ω\omega must vanish on them. Second, they must be Lagrangian: they must be maximal isotropic subspaces. Third, they must vary smoothly with xx. And fourth, they must be integrable.


The easiest sort of polarization to understand is a real polarization. This is where the subspaces P xP_x come from subspaces of the tangent space by complexification. It boils down to this: a real polarization is an integrable distribution PP on the classical phase space where each space P xP_x is Lagrangian subspace of the tangent space T xXT_x X.


To understand this rigamarole, one must study examples! First, it’s good to understand how good old Schrödinger quantization fits into this framework. Remember, in Schrödinger quantization we take our classical phase space XX to be the cotangent bundle T *MT^* M of a manifold MM called the classical configuration space. We then let our quantum Hilbert space be the space of all square-integrable functions on MM.
Modulo some technical trickery, we get this example when we run the above machinery and use a certain god-given real polarization on X=T *MX = T^*M, namely the one given by the vertical vectors.


It’s also good to study the Bargmann–Segal representation, which we get by taking X=ℂ nX = \mathbb{C}^n with its god-given symplectic structure (the imaginary part of the inner product) and using the god-given Kähler polarization. When we do this, our quantum Hilbert space consists of analytic functions on ℂ n\mathbb{C}^n which are square-integrable with respect to a Gaussian measure centered at the origin.


The next step is to quantize classical observables, turning them into linear operators on the quantum Hilbert space HH. Unfortunately, we can’t quantize all such observables while still sending Poisson brackets to commutators, as we did at the prequantum level. So at this point things get trickier and my brief outline will stop. Ultimately, the reason for this problem is that quantization is not a functor from the category of symplectic manifolds to the category of Hilbert spaces – but for that one needs to learn a bit about category theory.


Basic Jargon
Here are some definitions of important terms. Unfortunately they are defined using other terms that you might not understand. If you are really mystified, you need to read some books on differential geometry and the math of classical mechanics before proceeding.


complexification: We can tensor a real vector space with the complex numbers and get a complex vector space; this process is called complexification. For example, we can complexify the tangent space at some point of a manifold, which amounts to forming the space of complex linear combinations of tangent vectors at that point.


distribution: The word “distribution” means many different things in mathematics, but here’s one: a “distribution” VV on a manifold XX is a choice of a subspace V xV_x of each tangent space T pXT_p X, where the choice depends smoothly on xx.


Hamiltonian vector field: Given a manifold XX with a symplectic structure ω\omega, any smooth function f:X→ℝf: X \to \mathbb{R} can be thought of as a “Hamiltonian”, meaning physically that we think of it as the energy function and let it give rise to a flow on XX describing the time evolution of states. Mathematically speaking, this flow is generated by a vector field v(f)v(f) called the “Hamiltonian vector field” associated to ff. It is the unique vector field such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-, v(f)) = d f


In other words, for any vector field uu on XX we have
ω(u,v(f))=df(u)=uf
  \omega(u,v(f)) = d f(u) = u f


The vector field v(f)v(f) is guaranteed to exist by the fact that ω\omega is nondegenerate.


integrable distribution: A distribution of subspaces of the tangent bundle on a smooth manifold XX is “integrable” if at least locally, there is a foliation of XX by submanifolds such that V xV_x is the tangent space of the submanifold containing the point xx.


integral cohomology class: Any closed differential p-form on a smooth manifold MM defines an element of the ppth de Rham cohomology of MM. This is a finite-dimensional vector space, and it contains a lattice called the ppth integral cohomology group of MM. We say a cohomology class is integral if it lies in this lattice. Most notably, if you take any U(1)U(1) connection on any Hermitian line bundle over MM, its curvature 22-form will define an integral cohomology class once you divide it by 2πi2 \pi i. This cohomology class is called the first Chern class, and it serves to determine the line bundle up to isomorphism.


Poisson brackets: Given a symplectic structure on a manifold MM and given two smooth functions on that manifold, say ff and gg, there’s a trick for getting a new smooth function {f,g}\{f,g\} on the manifold, called the Poisson bracket of ff and gg.
This trick works as follows: given any smooth function ff we can take its differential dfd f, which is a 11-form. Then there is a unique vector field v(f)v(f), the Hamiltonian vector field associated to ff, such that
ω(−,v(f))=df
  \omega(-,v(f)) = d f


Using this we define
{f,g}=ω(v(f),v(g))
   \{f,g\} = \omega(v(f),v(g))
 

It’s easy to check that we also have {f,g}=dg(v(f))=v(f)g\{f,g\} = d g(v(f)) = v(f) g. So {f,g}\{f,g\} says how much gg changes as we differentiate it in the direction of the Hamiltonian vector field generated by ff.
In the familiar case where MM is ℝ 2n\mathbb{R}^{2n} with momentum and position coordinates p ip_i, q iq_i, the Poisson brackets of ff and gg work out to be
{f,g}=∑ idfdp idgdq i−dfdq idgdp i
   \{f,g\} = \sum_i \frac{d f}{d p_i} \frac{d g}{d q_i} - \frac{d f}{d q_i}\frac{d g}{d p_i}
 


square-integrable sections: We can define an inner product on the sections of a Hermitian line bundle over a manifold XX with a symplectic structure. The symplectic structure defines a volume form which lets us do the necessary integral. A section whose inner product with itself is finite is said to be square-integrable. Such sections form a Hilbert space H 0H_0 called the “prequantum Hilbert space”. It is a kind of preliminary version of the Hilbert space we get when we quantize the classical system whose phase space is XX.


symplectic structure: A symplectic structure on a manifold MM is a closed 22-form ω\omega which is nondegenerate in the sense that for any nonzero tangent vector uu at any point of MM, there is a tangent vector uu at that point for which w(u,v)w(u,v) is nonzero.


U(1)U(1) connection: The group U(1)U(1) is the group of unit complex numbers. Given a complex line bundle LL with an inner product on each fiber L xL_x, a U(1)U(1) connection on LL is a connection such that parallel translation preserves the inner product.


vertical vectors: Given a bundle EE over a manifold MM, we say a tangent vector to some point of EE is vertical if it projects to zero down on MM.


Geometric quantization involves two steps


Geometric prequantization


Geometric quantization proper.


Geometric prequantization
Prequantum line bundle
Given the symplectic form ω\omega, a prequantum circle bundle for it is a circle bundle with connection whose curvature is ω\omega.
In other words, prequantization is a lift of ω\omega through the curvature-exact sequence of ordinary differential cohomology (see there).
The multiple of the Chern class of this line bundle is identified with the inverse Planck constant.
Prequantum states
A prequantum state is a section of the prequantum bundle.
This becomes a quantum state or wavefunction if polarized (…).
Prequantum operators
Let ∇:X→BU(1) conn\nabla : X \to \mathbf{B} U(1)_{conn} be a prequantum line bundle E→XE \to X with connection for ω\omega. Write Γ X(E)\Gamma_X(E) for its space of smooth sections, the prequantum space of states.

Definition
(prequantum operators)
For f∈C ∞(X,ℂ)f \in C^\infty(X, \mathbb{C}) a function on phase space, the corresponding quantum operator is the linear map
f^:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)
  \hat f \colon \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E)


given by
(1)ψ↦−i∇ v fψ+f⋅ψ,
  
  \psi \mapsto -i \nabla_{v_f} \psi + f \cdot \psi
  \,,


where


v fv_f is the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to ff;


∇ v f:Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)\nabla_{v_f} : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the covariant derivative of sections along v fv_f for the given choice of prequantum connection;


f⋅(−):Γ X(E)→Γ X(E)f \cdot (-) : \Gamma_X(E) \to \Gamma_X(E) is the operation of degreewise multiplication pf sections.




Remark
(origin of the formulas for prequantum operators)+
The formula (1) may look a bit mysterious on first sight. The correction term to the covariant derivative appearing in this formula is ultimately due to the fact that with vv the Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to a Hamiltonian H vH_v via
ι vω=dH v
  \iota_v \omega = d H_v


then the Lie derivative of θ\theta (the symplectic potentiation, related by dθ=ωd \theta = \omega) is
ℒ vθ=dH˜ v
  \mathcal{L}_v \theta = d \tilde H_v


for
H˜ v=H v+ι vθ.
  \tilde H_v = H_v + \iota_v \theta
  \,.


Here the second term on the right is what yields the covariant derivative in (1), while the first summand is the correction term in (1).
A derivation of these formulas from first principles is given in (Fiorenza-Rogers-Schreiber 13a, example 3.2.3 and remark 3.3.16).

Geometric quantization
Given a prequantum bundle as above, the actual step of genuine geometric quantization consists first of forming half its space of sections in a certain sense. Physically this means passing to the space of wavefunctions that depend only on canonical positions but not on canonical momenta. Second, subgroups of the group of (exponentiated) prequantum operators are made to descend to this space of quantum states, these are the quantum operators or quantum observables.
Quantum states
Historically, the traditional way to formalize the formation of the space of quantum states is as a 3-step process


choose a Polarization;


choose a Metaplectic correction;


form the induced space of quantum states as the space of polarized sections of the prequantum line bundle tensored a certain half-form bundle.


This we discuss at

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections

This traditional route via polarizations and metaplectic corrections has the disadvantage that mathematically it is not a very natural operation. However, under mild conditions it turns out to be equivalent to the following mathematically very natural construction


choose a KU-orientation, hence a spin^c structure of XX compatible with the given prequantum bundle;


take the space of quantum states to be the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point, hence the index of the spin^c Dirac operator twisted by the prequantum line bundle.


This general geometric quantization by push-forward is discussed below at

Quantum space of states as index of a Dirac operator.

In the special case that the prequantum line bundle admits a Kähler polarization this push-forward quantization has a direct expression in terms of the complex abelian sheaf cohomology and of the Dolbeault operator of the prequantum holomorphic line bundle. Now the choice of metaplectic correction is precisely a spin structure (a “Theta characteristic”) and the index is now that of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator which is equivalently just the Euler characteristic of the holomorphic abelian sheaf cohomology of the prequantum line bundle. This complex Dolbeault quantization case we discuss in

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology

and

Quantum state space as index of the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state space as space of polarized sections
For (X,ω)(X, \omega) a symplectic manifold, choose a Kähler polarization, hence an involutive Lagrangian subbundle 𝒫⊂T 𝒞X\mathcal{P} \subset T_{\mathcal{C}} X such that 𝒫∩𝒫¯=0\mathcal{P} \cap \overline{\mathcal{P}} = 0. Choose moreover a metaplectic correction of 𝒫\mathcal{P}. This defines the half-density bundle Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} along 𝒫\mathcal{P}.
Let now (L,∇)(L,\nabla) be a prequantum line bundle for (X,ω)(X,\omega).

Definition
The space of quantum states of the prequantum bundle defined by the choice of Kähler polarization 𝒫\mathcal{P} and metaplectic correction Ω𝒫\sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} is the space of sections of the tensor product L⊗Ω𝒫L \otimes \sqrt{\Omega \mathcal{P}} which are covariant derivative covariantly constant with respect to ∇\nabla along 𝒫¯\overline{\mathcal{P}} and square integrable with respect to the induced integration over X/𝒫¯X/\overline{\mathcal{P}}:

For instance (Bates-Weinstein, def. 7.17).

Remark
In the case of Kähler polarization it is useful to write Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0} for the canonical line bundle of the polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} for the corresponding choice of metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.

Quantum state space as Euler characteristic of prequantum sheaf cohomology
Let (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a compact topological space symplectic manifold, L ωL_\omega a prequantum line bundle, 𝒫\mathcal{P} a Kähler polarization and Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} a metaplectic correction.

Definition
The corresponding Euler quantum Hilbert space is the virtual vector space
ℋ Euler≔⨁ k=0 n(−1) kH 0,k(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0),
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \coloneqq
  \bigoplus_{k = 0}^{n} (-1)^k \, H^{0,k}(X,L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}})
  \,,


which is the alternating direct sum of the Dolbeault cohomology space of XX with coefficients in the tensor product L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the prequantum line bundle with the metaplectic correction/Theta characteristic.


Remark
The Kodaira vanishing theorem asserts that if L ωΩ n,0 −1L_\omega \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1} is a positive line bundle then all the higher cohomology groups in the above expression vanish. Therefore in this case the definition coincides with that via polarizations in def.  above.
(L ω⊗Ω n,0 −1positive)⇒(ℋ pol≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(
    L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}^{-1}
    \;
    positive
  \right)
  \Rightarrow
  \left(
    \mathcal{H}_{pol} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


Quantum state space as index of Dolbeault-Dirac operator
Suppose again that (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is equipped with a Kähler polarization.
We need the following general fact on spin structures over Kähler manifolds.

Proposition
A choice of spin structure on the Kähler manifold XX (of real dimension 2n2n) is equivalently a choice of square root (“Theta characteristic”) Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} of the canonical line bundle Ω n,0\Omega^{n,0}.
Given such a choice, there is a natural isomorphism between the spinor bundle S XS_X and the (anti-)holomorphic form bundle tensored by this square root
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0.
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
 \,.


Finally, the corresponding Dirac operator is the Dolbeault-Dirac operator ∂¯+∂¯ *\overline{\partial} + \overline{\partial}^\ast.

See at spin structure – Over a Kähler manifold.

Remark
It follows that the Dirac operator on XX which is twisted by the connection ∇\nabla on the prequantum holomorphic line bundle L ωL_\omega is of the form
∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *:Ω 0,even/odd(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0)→Ω 0,odd/even(X,L ω⊗Ω n,0).
  \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}^\ast_\nabla
  \;\colon\;
  \Omega^{0,even/odd}\left(X, \;L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \to 
  \Omega^{0,odd/even}\left(X, \; L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
  \,.


Observe how from the point of view of just the Dolbeault operator, this is twisting not just by the prequantum line bundle itself but by the metaplectically corrected prequantum line bundle L ω⊗Ω n,0L_\omega \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}, while from the point of view of the Dirac operator it is just twisting by L ωL_\omega, since tensoring with the square root line bundle Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} induces the isomorphism between the antiholomorphic differential form bundle and the actual spinor bundle over the Kähler manifold.


Definition
The Dolbeault-Dirac space of quantum states of (X,ω,L ω)(X,\omega, L_\omega) is the index of the L ωL_\omega-twisted Dolbeault-Dirac operator (the Todd genus)
ℋ DolbDir≔index(∂¯ ∇+∂¯ ∇ *).
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDir} 
    \coloneqq
  index( \overline{\partial}_\nabla + \overline{\partial}_\nabla^\ast )
  \,.



Remark
This definition agrees with that by abelian sheaf cohomology in def. 
ℋ Euler≃ℋ DolbDirac.
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac}
  \,.



Remark
What before in the quantization prescription by polarization and by abelian sheaf cohomology was the “metaplectic correction” introduced “by hand” is now naturally part of the isomorphism of prop.  which identifies the Dirac operator with the Dolbeault-Dirac operator.

Quantum state spaces as index of the Spin cSpin^c-Dirac operator
Finally we come to the true definition of geometric quantization, the most general and at the same time most natural one which contains the above as special cases.
The actual definition is def.  below. Here we lead up to it by spelling out the ingredients.
We need the following general facts about spin^c Dirac operators.

Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, the spin^c-Lie group Spin c(n)Spin^c(n) is equivalently


the tensor product of the ordinary spin group Spin(n)Spin(n) with the circle group over the group of order 2
Spin c≃Spin(n)×ℤ 2U(1)
  Spin^c \simeq Spin(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1)



the loop space object
Spin c≃ΩBSpin c
  Spin^c \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B} Spin^c


of the homotopy fiber product of the universal smooth second Stiefel-Whitney class and the mod-2 reduction of the universal first Chern class in smooth infinity-groupoids:
BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ ⇙ ≃ ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &\swArrow_\simeq& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod \, 2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.



Here the top horizontal map is called the universal determinant line bundle map.

See at spin^c group for more details.

Remark
It follows that if we represent elements of Spin c(n)≃SO(n)×ℤ 2U(1)Spin^c(n) \simeq SO(n) \underset{\mathbb{Z}_2}{\times} U(1) as equivalence classes of pairs (g,c)(g,c), then the determinant line bundle map of def.  is given by
det:(g,c)↦2c,
  det \;\colon \; (g,c) \mapsto 2c
  \,,


where on the right we write the group operation in the abelian group U(1)U(1) additively.
This factor of 2 on the right is crucial in all of the following.


Definition
Let XX be an oriented smooth manifold. A smooth spin^c structure on XX is a lift τ^ X\hat \tau_X of the classifying map τ X:X→BSO(n)\tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B} SO(n) of its tangent bundle through the left vertical map in def. 
  BSpin c(n)   τ^ X↗ ↓ X →τ X BSO(n).
  \array{
    && \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n)
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{\hat \tau_X}}\nearrow & \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{\tau_X}{\to}& \mathbf{B}SO(n)
  }
  \,.



Remark
In words this says that a spin^c structure on an oriented manifold XX is a choice of circle group-principal bundle or equivalenty of hermitian complex line bundle such that its first Chern class modulo 2 equals the second Stiefel-Whitney class w 2w_2 of XX. If this second Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes (as an element in H 2(X,ℤ 2)H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2)) this means that XX has a genuine spin structure. So in other words whenever the determinant line bundle of a spin^c structure (in the sens of def. ) has a first Chern class that is divisible by 2, then there is an actual spin^c structure.
We can formalize this statement as follows: there is a commuting square of the form
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →((2⋅)∘p 2 BU(1) ↓  ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2
  \array{
     \mathbf{B}( Spin(n) \times U(1) ) &\stackrel{((2 \cdot)\circ p_2}{\to}&
     \mathbf{B}U(1)
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\mathbf{c}_1 \, mod\, 2}}
     \\
     \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}^2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }


similar to the one in def.  but crucially different in that here we have just the cartesian product of Spin(n)Spin(n) with U(1)U(1) in the top left. In the standard presentation of these objects this diagram commutes on the nose (filled by a canonical homotopy) simply because both ways to go from the top left to the bottom right hit 0∈ℤ 20 \in \mathbb{Z}_2: the left-bottom one because BSpin(n)\mathbf{B}Spin(n) is essentially by definition such that the second SW class trivializes on it, and the top-right one because first multiplying by 2 and then reducing mod 2 is 0.
Since the diagram commutes, the universal property of the above homotopy pullback says that there is a canonically induced map
(p 1,p 2):Spin(n)×U(1)→Spin c(n).
  (p_1, p_2) \;\colon\; Spin(n) \times U(1) \to Spin^c(n)
  \,.


Of course this is just the evident quotient projection which on elements is simply the identity
(g,c)↦(g,c),
  (g,c) \mapsto (g,c)
  \,,


only that on the right we regard the pair (g,c)(g,c) as a placeholder for its equivalence class in the tensor product over ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2.
Moreover, the universal property of the homotopy pullback says that every spin^c structure τ^ c\hat \tau_c whose underlying determinant line bundle is such that its first Chern class is divisible by 2 actually factors through this map, hence that it is just the product of an ordinary SpinSpin-principal bundle with a circle bundle.
B(Spin(n)×U(1)) →p 2 BU(1)  (p 1,p 2)↓  ↓ B(2⋅) BSpin c(n) →det BU(1) ↓ (pb) ↓ c 1mod2 BSO(n) →w 2 B 2ℤ 2.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}(Spin(n) \times U(1)) &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{(p_1,p_2)}}\downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathbf{B}(2 \cdot)}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n) &\stackrel{det}{\to}& \mathbf{B}U(1)
    \\
    \downarrow &(pb)& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{c_1\,mod\,2}}
    \\
    \mathbf{B}SO(n) &\stackrel{\mathbf{w}_2}{\to}& \mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{Z}_2
  }
  \,.


This is the crucial relation by which the K-theoretic quantization will harmonize with the above Euler- and Dolbeault- quantization, discussed below.


Definition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} an even number, write
Δ n≃ℂ 2 n/2
  \Delta_n \simeq \mathbb{C}^{2^{n/2}}


for the canonical complex spin representation, which decomposes into two chiral irreducible representations
Δ n≃Δ n +⊕Δ n −.
  \Delta_n \simeq \Delta_n^+ \oplus \Delta_n^-
  \,.


Then the canonical spin^c-representation
ρ:Spin c(n)×Δ n→Δ n
  \rho \colon Spin^c(n) \times \Delta_n \to \Delta_n


is the one given in the components of remark  by
((g,c),ψ)↦(g(ψ))⋅c
  ((g,c), \psi) \mapsto (g(\psi)) \cdot c


(first act with the spin-component in the usual way and then multiply by c∈U(1)↪ℂc \in U(1) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}).

As discussed at representation we may think of this as a morphism of smooth groupoids (stacks) of the form
ρ:BSpin c(n)→ℂMod≃ℂVect.
  \rho \colon \mathbf{B} Spin^c(n) \to \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Mod} \simeq \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.



Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X:X→BSpin c(n)\hat \tau_X \colon X \to \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n), def. , the associated spinor bundle is the one modulated by
S c:X→τ^ XBSpin c(n)→ρℂVect.
  S^c
  \colon
  X \stackrel{\hat \tau_X}{\to} \mathbf{B}Spin^c(n)
  \stackrel{\rho}{\to} \mathbb{C}\mathbf{Vect}
  \,.


Crucial for the comparison of the K-theoretic quantization to be defined in a moment and the above Euler/Dolbeault quantization is the following:

Remark
By remark  it follows that in the case that the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure is divisible by 2, hence in the case that c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2∈H 2(X,ℤ 2)c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \in H^2(X,\mathbb{Z}_2), then the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle of def.  is just the tensor product of the ordinary underlying spinor bundle with half the determinant line bundle:
(c 1(det(τ^ X))=0mod2)⇒(S c≃S⊗det(τ^ X)).
  \left( c_1(det(\hat \tau_X)) = 0 \,mod\, 2 \right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(S^c \simeq S \otimes \sqrt{det(\hat \tau_X)}\right)
  \,.


Let now (X,ω)(X,\omega) be a (pre-)symplectic manifold and let (L ω,∇)(L_{\omega}, \nabla) be a prequantum line bundle.

Definition
Given a spin^c structure τ^ X\hat \tau_X on XX whose underlying determinant line bundle coincides, up to equivalence, with (L ω) ⊗ 2(L_\omega)^{\otimes^2}, then the spin^c quantization of this prequantum data is the index of the corresponding spin^c Dirac operator D cD_{\mathbf{c}}:
ℋ K≔index(D c).
  \mathcal{H}_{K} \coloneqq index(D_{\mathbf{c}})
  \,.



Remark
This is equivalently the push-forward in complex K-theory of the prequantum line bundle to the point.
Moreover, on cocycles this push-forward is expressed by the traditional construction of Hilbert spaces of quantum states:
let XX be a manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric, a spinor bundle and a Dirac operator D:Γ(S)→Γ(S)D \colon \Gamma(S) \to \Gamma(S). Then the corresponding K-homology cycle is:


the Hilbert space L 2(S)L^2(S) of square integrable sections of the spinor bundle;


equipped with the action by fiberwise multiplication of the C*-algebra C 0(X)C_0(X) of functions vanishing at infinity
C 0(X)→ℬ(L 2(S))
  C_0(X) \to \mathcal{B}(L^2(S))


(which is by bounded operators)


and equipped with the Dirac operator DD as the ℤ 2\mathbb{Z}_2-graded Fredholm operator defining the K-homology class.


Together with is equivalent an element
[D,L 2(S)]∈KK(C 0(X),ℂ).
  [D, L^2(S)] \in KK(C_0(X), \mathbb{C})
  \,.


Postcomposition of K-theory classes [ξ]∈KK(ℂ,C 0(X))[\xi] \in KK(\mathbb{C}, C_0(X)) with this map is the push-forward/index map in K-theory.


Remark
This definition does not assume any choice of polarization, nor any choice of complex structure etc. On the other hand, every choice of almost complex structure (hence in particular of Kähler polarization) does induce a spin^c structure, as discussed there. See also (Borthwick-Uribe 96).

So then we can compare:

Proposition
If a choice of Kähler polarization exists on the compact prequantum geometry (X,L ω)(X,L_\omega), then the K-theoretic quantization of def.  coincides with the Dolbeault-Dirac quantization of def.  and hence, by remark , with the Euler-characteristic definition, def. , so that all the respectives spaces of quantum states agree:
((X,ω)Kaehler)⇒(ℋ K≃ℋ DolbDirac≃ℋ Euler).
  \left(\left(X,\omega\right) \; Kaehler\right)
  \;\Rightarrow\;
  \left(
  \mathcal{H}_K 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{DolbDirac} 
   \simeq 
  \mathcal{H}_{Euler}
  \right)
  \,.


This is to some extent discussed for instance in (Hochs 08, lemma 3.32, Paradan 09, prop. 2.2).

Proof
Let Ω n,0\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}} be a choice of square root (Theta characteristic) of the canonical line bundle, which according to  is a choice of spin structure in the Kähler manifold. Then by that same proposition the corresponding spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S≃Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0
  S \simeq \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}


and so the corresponding L ωL_\omega-twisted spinor bundle is
S⊗L ω ≃(Ω 0,•⊗Ω n,0)⊗L ω  ≃Ω 0,•⊗(Ω n,0⊗L ω),
  \begin{aligned}
   S \otimes L_\omega & \simeq
   \left(\Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}\right)
    \otimes L_\omega
    \\
    & \simeq
   \Omega^{0,\bullet} \otimes \left(\sqrt{\Omega^{n,0}}
    \otimes L_\omega\right)
  \end{aligned}
  \,,


where we have re-bracheted just for emphasis of how the metaplectic correction appears as part of the spinor bundle.
At the same time, by remark  we have that under this assumption that an actual spin structure exists, the Spin cSpin^c-spinor bundle is isomorphic to
S c≃S⊗L ω.
  S^c \simeq S \otimes L_\omega
  \,.


So the two spinor bundles agree. It is now sufficient to observe that under this identification both the Dolbeault-Dirac operator as well as the spin^c Dirac operator have the same symbol to conclude that they have the same index.


Remark
The assumption in the above that we do have a spin structure is only for comparison with the Euler-/ Dolbeault-quantization. It is not necessary for the K-theoretic geometric quantization by spin^c structure.
In the general case the determinant line bundle of the spin^c structure may not admit a square root. (Its failure of having a square root will be compensated precisely by the failure of there being a genuine spin structure.) Still, by the above discussion the index of the corresponding spin^c structure is like a quantization of a would-be square root of the determinant line bundle in this case.

Quantum operators / observables
Given a Hamiltonian action on the symplectic manifold by a Lie group GG, we can apply the above K-theoretic quantization by push-foward in GG-equivariant K-theory, to
K G(*)≃K(*//G)≃R(G)
  K_G(\ast) \simeq K(\ast//G) \simeq R(G)


This is the representation ring of GG and hence yields not just a Hilbert space, but a Hilbert space equipped with a GG-action. This is the action by quantum operators, quantizing the GG-actions. Generalized orientation theory give the necessary condition for this quantization to exist: XX needs to be oriented not just in K-theory (spin^c structure) but in GG-equivariant K-theory (equivariant spin^c structure).
So the geometric quantization of observables is essentially what mathematically is known as Dirac induction.

Quantum field theory is the general framework for the description of the fundamental processes in physics as understood today. These are carried by configurations of fields under the generalized rules of quantum mechanics, therefore the name. Notably the standard model of particle physics is a quantum field theory and has been the main motivation for the development of the concept in general.
Historically quantum field theory grew out of attempts to combine classical field theory in the context of special relativity with quantum mechanics. While some aspects of it are understood in exceeding detail, the overall picture of what quantum field theory actually is used to be quite mysterious. There are two main approaches for axiomatizing and formalizing the notion:


algebraic quantum field theory: AQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of operator algebras “of observables” to patches of spacetime;


functorial quantum field theory: FQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of spaces of quantum states to patches of codimension 1, and of maps between spaces of states – the time evolution operator – to cobordisms between such patches.


Both these approaches try to capture the notion of a full quantum field theory. On the other hand, much activity in physics is concerned with perturbative quantum field theory. This is a priori to be thought of as an approximation to a full quantum field theory akin to the approximation of a function by its Taylor series, but not the least because it is often the only available technique, the tools of perturbative quantum field theory are to some extent also taken as a definition of quantum field theory.
The gap for instance between the formal study of the AQFT axioms and physics as done in practice by physicists had to a large extent been due to the fact that AQFT had little to say about perturbative quantum field theory. But recently this has been changing. See perturbative quantum field theory for more.
Recent times have seen major progress in understanding these axiomatizations and connecting them to the structures studied in physics (see the references below), but still the number of interesting phenomena in quantum field theory that physicists handle semi-rigorously and that are waiting for a fully formal understanding is large.
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.

Decidability

In the context of foundations of mathematics the term practical foundations (following a term introduced in (Taylor)) refers to emphasis on conceptually natural formalizations.

In my own education I was fortunate to have two teachers who used the term “foundations” in a common-sense way (rather than in the speculative way of the Bolzano-Frege-Peano-Russell tradition). This way is exemplified by their work in Foundations of Algebraic Topology, published in 1952 by Eilenberg (with Steenrod), and The Mechanical Foundations of Elasticity and Fluid Mechanics, published in the same year by Truesdell. The orientation of these works seemed to be “concentrate the essence of practice and in turn use the result to guide practice”. (Lawvere 2003: 213)

Formal systems of interest here are natural deduction in type theories, which allow natural expressions for central concepts in mathematics, notably via their categorical semantics and the conceptual strength of category theory (see Harper).
In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)
Physics studies the constituting mechanisms of the observable universe.
Starting with suggestions by Galileo around 1600 and then clearly so since Newton in 1687 laid the foundations of physics proper with what is since called Newton's laws of physics, distinguishing it from the earlier natural philosophy, physics is specifically concerned with modelling experimentally observed phenomenology by “physical laws” formulated in the language of mathematics.

Philosophy[[i.e. physics ]] is written in this grand book — I mean the universe — which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth. (Galileo Galilei in Galilei, Il Saggiatore, 1623).

The relation to mathematics is typically the stronger the more one turns to fundamental physics (e.g. fundamental particles) and away from complex systems or else the more one coarse-grains irregular complex behaviour and studies statistical aspects in statistical physics.
The present most fundamental understanding of the physics of the observable universe is summarized in models (in theoretical physics) called


the standard model of particle physics


the standard model of cosmology;


which are formulated in the two fundamental theories called


Yang-Mills-gauge theory


Einstein-gravity


which in turn are both instances of the general framework of classical/quantum field theory.
Theoretical physics also studies lots of approximate, hypothetical “toy”- and test-case models (in theoretical physics), exploring the “space of physical theories”, and parts of mathematical physics overlaps with pure mathematics, the relation to physics only serving as a motivation that may or may not eventually lead back to statements about phenomenology.
In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
The standard model of particle physics is a model (in particle physics): a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles currently experimentally known, containing

matter: electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other fermions,

as well as three of the four fundamental forces as currently known, which, somewhat roughly, are

force: the electroweak force (including electromagnetism) and the strong nuclear force.

It is defined as a local Lagrangian field theory which is an Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory.
The main ingredient missing from the standard model is the quantum version of the field of gravity. For decades, a large part of theoretical physics has been absorbed with attempts to understand how this last of the known fundamental forces might fit into the picture.
As a quantum field theory, the standard model is in particular a Yang–Mills gauge theory with spinors in Yang–Mills theory.
Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a quantum field theory is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model.
Gauge group
The exact gauge group of the standard model is not quite the product group
U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)


of the circle group with special unitary groups, but is the quotient group
(1)G SM=(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6
  
  G_{SM} 
  \;=\;
  \big(
    U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \big)
  / \mathbb{Z}_6


of that by a cyclic group ℤ 6⊂U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)\mathbb{Z}_6 \subset U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) which is the subgroup generated from an element of the form
(q 6,q 21 2,q 31 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3),
  (q_6, q_2 \mathbf{1}_2, q_3 \mathbf{1}_3) \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,,


where q n∈U(1)q_n \in U(1) denotes an nnth primitive root of unity, i.e.
(e 2πi16,e 2πi121 2,e 2πi131 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3).
  \left(
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{6}}
    \;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{2}} \mathbf{1}_2\;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{3}} \mathbf{1}_3
  \right) 
  \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,.


(See Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36 for a fairly comprehensive discussion. See also e.g. HMY 13, p. 2.)
Strikingly, this exact gauge group (1) of the standard model of particle physics happens to coincide with…


…the group
G SM≃S(U(2)×U(3))⊂SU(5)
   G_{SM} 
    \;\simeq\; 
   S\big(U(2) \times U(3)\big) 
    \;\subset\; 
   SU(5)


of determinant-1 elements in the direct product group U(2)×U(3)U(2) \times U(3), which makes manifest that the standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the simple Lie group SU(5).
This is the basis of “grand unified theories” (GUT), speculative extensions of the standard model trying to understand its gauge group as being a spontaneously broken simple Lie group-symmetry.


…the subgroup of the Jordan algebra automorphism group of the octonionic Albert algebra that “stabilizes a 4d sub-Minkowski spacetime” (see there for details).
More concretely, it is identified with the subgroup of Spin(9) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19, see also at SO(10)-GUT)


This is part of ongoing speculation that octonionic exceptional structures might be behind the standard model.

General
A spacetime is a manifold that models space and time in physics.
This is formalized by saying that a spacetime is a smooth Lorentzian space (X,μ)(X,\mu) equipped with a time orientation (see there).
Hence a point in a spacetime is called an event.
In the context of classical general relativity a spacetime is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional. A connected Lorentzian manifold is either time orientable or it has a two-sheeted covering which is time orientable.
In classical physics, notably in special relativity and general relativity points in XX model coordinates where events can take place from the viewpoint of an observer (“points in space and time”) while the metric μ\mu models the field of gravity in general relativity.
Intermingling of space and time
The noun “spacetime” is used in both special relativity and general relativity, but is best motivated from the viewpoint of general relativity. Special relativity deals with the Minkowski spacetime only. The Minkowski spacetime allows a canonical choice of global coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.
Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined canonical time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the physical interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates changes over the domain of definition.

Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.
(…)
Decidability
(…)
Deductive reasoning is the process of passing from premises to conclusions in such a way that the truth of the former necessitates the truth of the latter. In other words, deductive logic studies what it is for an argument to be valid.
In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
In SU(n)SU(n)-Yang-Mills theory an instanton is a field configuration with non-vanishing second Chern class that minimizes the Yang-Mills energy.
Let (X,g)(X,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 4. Let GG be a compact Lie group.
A field configuration of GG-Yang-Mills theory on (X,g)(X,g) is a GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X with connection ∇\nabla.
For G=SU(n)G = SU(n) the special unitary group, there is canonically an associated complex vector bundle E=P× Gℂ nE = P \times_G \mathbb{C}^n.
Write F ∇∈Ω 2(X,End(E))F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(E)) for the curvature 2-form of ∇\nabla.
One says that ∇\nabla is an instanton configuration if F ∇F_\nabla is Hodge-self dual
⋆F ∇=F ∇,
  \star F_\nabla =  F_\nabla
  \,,


where ⋆:Ω k(X)→Ω 4−k(X)\star : \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^{4-k}(X) is the Hodge star operator induced by the Riemannian metric gg.
The second Chern class of PP, which by the Chern-Weil homomorphism is given by
c 2(E)=∫ XTr(F ∇∧F ∇)=k∈H 4(X,ℤ)
 c_2(E) = \int_X Tr(F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla)
  =
  k
  \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})


is called the instanton number or the instanton sector of ∇\nabla.
Notice that therefore any connection, even if not self-dual, is in some instanton sector, as its underlying bundle has some second Chern class, meaning that it can be obtained from shifting a self-dual connection. The self-dual connections are a convenient choice of “base point” in each instanton sector.
As gradient flows between flat connections.
We discuss how Yang-Mills instantons may be understood as trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons theory action functional.
Let (Σ,g Σ)(\Sigma,g_\Sigma) be a compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold .
Let the cartesian product
X=Σ×ℝ
  X = \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}


of Σ\Sigma with the real line be equipped with the product metric of gg with the canonical metric on ℝ\mathbb{R}.
Consider field configurations ∇\nabla of Yang-Mills theory over Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} with finite Yang-Mills action
S YM(∇)=∫ Σ×ℝF ∇∧⋆F ∇<∞.
  S_{YM}(\nabla) = \int_{\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}} F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla
  \,\,\lt  \infty
  \,.


These must be such that there is t 1<t 2∈ℝt_1 \lt t_2 \in \mathbb{R} such that F ∇(t<t 1)=0F_\nabla(t \lt t_1) = 0 and F ∇(T>t 2)=0F_\nabla(T \gt t_2) = 0, hence these must be solutions interpolating between two flat connections ∇ t 1\nabla_{t_1} and ∇ t 2\nabla_{t_2}.
For A∈Ω 1(U×ℝ,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(U\times \mathbb{R}, \mathfrak{g}) the Lie algebra valued 1-form corresponding to ∇\nabla, we can always find a gauge transformation such that A ∂ t=0A_{\partial_t} = 0 (“temporal gauge”). In this gauge we may hence equivalently think of AA as a 1-parameter family
t↦A(t)∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)
  t \mapsto A(t) \in \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})


of connections on Σ\Sigma. Then the self-duality condition on a Yang-Mills instanton
F ∇=−⋆F ∇
  F_\nabla = - \star F_\nabla


reads equivalently
ddtA=−⋆ gF A∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤).
  \frac{d}{d t} A = -\star_{g} F_A
  \,\,\,
  \in 
  \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})
  \,.



Definition
On the linear configuration space Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) of Lie algebra valued forms on Σ\Sigma define the Hodge inner product metric
G(α,β):=∫ Σ⟨α∧⋆ gβ⟩,
  G(\alpha, \beta) := \int_{\Sigma} \langle \alpha \wedge \star_g \beta \rangle
  \,,


where ⟨−,−⟩:𝔤⊗𝔤→ℝ\langle-,-\rangle : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R} is the Killing form invariant polynomial on the Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.


Proposition
The instanton equation
ddtA=−⋆ gF A
  \frac{d}{d t} A = 
  -\star_{g} F_A


is the equation characterizing trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons action functional
S CS:Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)→ℝ
  S_{CS} : \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}

A↦∫ ΣCS(A)
  A \mapsto \int_\Sigma CS(A)


with respect to the Hodge inner product metric on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}).


Proof
The variation of the Chern-Simons action is
δS CS(A)=∫ Σ⟨δA∧F A⟩
  \delta S_{CS}(A) = \int_\Sigma \langle \delta A \wedge F_A\rangle


(see Chern-Simons theory for details).
In other words, we have the 1-form on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}):
δS CS(−) A=∫ Σ⟨−∧F A⟩.
  \delta S_{CS}(-)_A
  = 
  \int_\Sigma \langle - \wedge F_A \rangle
  \,.


The corresponding gradient vector field
∇S CS:=G −1δS CS
  \nabla S_{CS}
   :=
  G^{-1} \delta S_{CS}


is uniquely defined by the equation
δS CS(−) =G(−,∇S CS) ∫ Σ⟨−,⋆∇S CS⟩.
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta S_{CS}(-) 
     & = G(-,\nabla S_{CS})
    \\
    \int_\Sigma \langle - , \star \nabla S_{CS}\rangle
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


With the formula (see Hodge star operator)
⋆⋆A=(−1) 1(3+1)A=A
  \star \star A = (-1)^{1(3+1)} A = A


we find therefore
∇S CS=⋆ gF A.
  \nabla S_{CS} = \star_g F_A
  \,.


Hence the gradient flow equation
ddtA+∇S CSA=0
  \frac{d}{d t} A + \nabla S_{CS}_A = 0


is indeed
ddtA=−⋆ gF A.
  \frac{d}{d t} A =  - \star_g F_A
  \,.


Since flat connections are the critical loci of S CSS_{CS} this says that a finite-action Yang-Mills instanton on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} is a gradient flow trajectory between two Chern-Simons theory vacua .
Often this is interpreted as saying that “a Yang-Mills instanton describes the tunneling between two Chern-Simons theory vacua”.
As Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states
Due to the higher WZW term ∝∫ D p+4C p+1∧⟨F∧F⟩\propto \int_{D_{p+4}} C_{p+1} \wedge \langle F \wedge F \rangle in the Green-Schwarz sigma model for D(p+4)-branes, Yang-Mills instantons in the Chan-Paton gauge field on D(p+4)D (p+4)-branes are equivalently Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states (see e.g. Polchinski 96, 5.4, Tong 05, 1.4).

The solutions to linear equations and linear differential equations may be linearly combined to produce further solutions. Such linear combinations, in particular the sums of two solutions, is also called superposition of solutions, in particular if it concerns solutions to wave equations.
In SU(n)SU(n)-Yang-Mills theory an instanton is a field configuration with non-vanishing second Chern class that minimizes the Yang-Mills energy.
Let (X,g)(X,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 4. Let GG be a compact Lie group.
A field configuration of GG-Yang-Mills theory on (X,g)(X,g) is a GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X with connection ∇\nabla.
For G=SU(n)G = SU(n) the special unitary group, there is canonically an associated complex vector bundle E=P× Gℂ nE = P \times_G \mathbb{C}^n.
Write F ∇∈Ω 2(X,End(E))F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(E)) for the curvature 2-form of ∇\nabla.
One says that ∇\nabla is an instanton configuration if F ∇F_\nabla is Hodge-self dual
⋆F ∇=F ∇,
  \star F_\nabla =  F_\nabla
  \,,


where ⋆:Ω k(X)→Ω 4−k(X)\star : \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^{4-k}(X) is the Hodge star operator induced by the Riemannian metric gg.
The second Chern class of PP, which by the Chern-Weil homomorphism is given by
c 2(E)=∫ XTr(F ∇∧F ∇)=k∈H 4(X,ℤ)
 c_2(E) = \int_X Tr(F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla)
  =
  k
  \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})


is called the instanton number or the instanton sector of ∇\nabla.
Notice that therefore any connection, even if not self-dual, is in some instanton sector, as its underlying bundle has some second Chern class, meaning that it can be obtained from shifting a self-dual connection. The self-dual connections are a convenient choice of “base point” in each instanton sector.
As gradient flows between flat connections.
We discuss how Yang-Mills instantons may be understood as trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons theory action functional.
Let (Σ,g Σ)(\Sigma,g_\Sigma) be a compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold .
Let the cartesian product
X=Σ×ℝ
  X = \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}


of Σ\Sigma with the real line be equipped with the product metric of gg with the canonical metric on ℝ\mathbb{R}.
Consider field configurations ∇\nabla of Yang-Mills theory over Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} with finite Yang-Mills action
S YM(∇)=∫ Σ×ℝF ∇∧⋆F ∇<∞.
  S_{YM}(\nabla) = \int_{\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}} F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla
  \,\,\lt  \infty
  \,.


These must be such that there is t 1<t 2∈ℝt_1 \lt t_2 \in \mathbb{R} such that F ∇(t<t 1)=0F_\nabla(t \lt t_1) = 0 and F ∇(T>t 2)=0F_\nabla(T \gt t_2) = 0, hence these must be solutions interpolating between two flat connections ∇ t 1\nabla_{t_1} and ∇ t 2\nabla_{t_2}.
For A∈Ω 1(U×ℝ,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(U\times \mathbb{R}, \mathfrak{g}) the Lie algebra valued 1-form corresponding to ∇\nabla, we can always find a gauge transformation such that A ∂ t=0A_{\partial_t} = 0 (“temporal gauge”). In this gauge we may hence equivalently think of AA as a 1-parameter family
t↦A(t)∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)
  t \mapsto A(t) \in \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})


of connections on Σ\Sigma. Then the self-duality condition on a Yang-Mills instanton
F ∇=−⋆F ∇
  F_\nabla = - \star F_\nabla


reads equivalently
ddtA=−⋆ gF A∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤).
  \frac{d}{d t} A = -\star_{g} F_A
  \,\,\,
  \in 
  \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})
  \,.



Definition
On the linear configuration space Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) of Lie algebra valued forms on Σ\Sigma define the Hodge inner product metric
G(α,β):=∫ Σ⟨α∧⋆ gβ⟩,
  G(\alpha, \beta) := \int_{\Sigma} \langle \alpha \wedge \star_g \beta \rangle
  \,,


where ⟨−,−⟩:𝔤⊗𝔤→ℝ\langle-,-\rangle : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R} is the Killing form invariant polynomial on the Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.


Proposition
The instanton equation
ddtA=−⋆ gF A
  \frac{d}{d t} A = 
  -\star_{g} F_A


is the equation characterizing trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons action functional
S CS:Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)→ℝ
  S_{CS} : \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}

A↦∫ ΣCS(A)
  A \mapsto \int_\Sigma CS(A)


with respect to the Hodge inner product metric on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}).


Proof
The variation of the Chern-Simons action is
δS CS(A)=∫ Σ⟨δA∧F A⟩
  \delta S_{CS}(A) = \int_\Sigma \langle \delta A \wedge F_A\rangle


(see Chern-Simons theory for details).
In other words, we have the 1-form on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}):
δS CS(−) A=∫ Σ⟨−∧F A⟩.
  \delta S_{CS}(-)_A
  = 
  \int_\Sigma \langle - \wedge F_A \rangle
  \,.


The corresponding gradient vector field
∇S CS:=G −1δS CS
  \nabla S_{CS}
   :=
  G^{-1} \delta S_{CS}


is uniquely defined by the equation
δS CS(−) =G(−,∇S CS) ∫ Σ⟨−,⋆∇S CS⟩.
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta S_{CS}(-) 
     & = G(-,\nabla S_{CS})
    \\
    \int_\Sigma \langle - , \star \nabla S_{CS}\rangle
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


With the formula (see Hodge star operator)
⋆⋆A=(−1) 1(3+1)A=A
  \star \star A = (-1)^{1(3+1)} A = A


we find therefore
∇S CS=⋆ gF A.
  \nabla S_{CS} = \star_g F_A
  \,.


Hence the gradient flow equation
ddtA+∇S CSA=0
  \frac{d}{d t} A + \nabla S_{CS}_A = 0


is indeed
ddtA=−⋆ gF A.
  \frac{d}{d t} A =  - \star_g F_A
  \,.


Since flat connections are the critical loci of S CSS_{CS} this says that a finite-action Yang-Mills instanton on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} is a gradient flow trajectory between two Chern-Simons theory vacua .
Often this is interpreted as saying that “a Yang-Mills instanton describes the tunneling between two Chern-Simons theory vacua”.
As Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states
Due to the higher WZW term ∝∫ D p+4C p+1∧⟨F∧F⟩\propto \int_{D_{p+4}} C_{p+1} \wedge \langle F \wedge F \rangle in the Green-Schwarz sigma model for D(p+4)-branes, Yang-Mills instantons in the Chan-Paton gauge field on D(p+4)D (p+4)-branes are equivalently Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states (see e.g. Polchinski 96, 5.4, Tong 05, 1.4).

In quantum field theory
In quantum field theory a vacuum state is supposed to be a quantum state that expresses the absence of any particle excitations of the fields.
On Minkowski spacetime the vacuum state for a free field theory is the standard Hadamard state. On general globally hyperbolic spacetimes there are always Hadamard states, and they do play the role of the vacuum state in the construction of AQFT on curved spacetimes, see at locally covariant perturbative AQFT. Notably the choice of such a Hadamard state fixes the Feynman propagator, hence the time-ordered product of quantum observables and thus the perturbative S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points (the extension of these distributions to coinciding interaction points is the process of renormalization).
However, since on a general globally hyperbolic spacetime there is no globally well-defined concept of particles, there is in general no concept of vacuum state. But under good conditions (such as existence of suitable timelike Killing vectors) one may identify Hadamard states which deserve to be thought of as vacuum states (Brum-Fredenhagen 13).
In string theory
As mentioned above, in perturbative quantum field theory a choice of vacuum state (more generally: Hadamard state) defines the Feynman propagator, hence the time-ordered product of quantum observables and thus the perturbative S-matrix away from coinciding interaction points and extended to coincing interaction points via a choice of renormalization.
Now perturbative string theory is not a local field theory, in which the S-matrix is derived (up to choice of vacuum state and renormalization) from a local Lagrangian density, but is defined by declaring the string perturbation series (obtained by other means, namely by 2d CFT correlators) to be the scattering matrix.
Hence while a vacuum in perturbative string theory cannot be a quantum state as in local field theory (since there is a priori just no free field Wick algebra that it could be a quantum state on), it makes sense to define a vacuum of perturvative string theory to be whatever data it takes to define the stringy S-matrix, namely the string perturbation series. This datum is that of a 2d SCFT (of central charge 15).
Hence in perturbative string theory the vacua of the effective background QFT are at the same time identified with certain 2-dimensional CFTs – which for “geometric vacua” are the string sigma-models which have the given effective QFT as their second quantization.
Perturbative string theory is defined as the string perturbation series of these sigma-models about these vacua.
The moduli space of these vacua – which is hardly understood – has come to be called the landscape of string theory vacua .
On the very largest scales observable in astrophysical experiment, the cosmos is well described by an FRW model with cosmological constant Λ\Lambda (but see at inhomogeneous cosmology), with plenty of dark matter and with primordial cosmic inflation (called the Λ\Lambda-CDM “concordance model of cosmology”). A horizon in there and everything on smaller scales is the observable universe.
There has never been a reason to assume that beyond this cosmic horizon visible to us today, the cosmos would not extend further. In fact in the simple FRW models with positive cosmological constant, the spacetime manifold is not a closed manifold and extends indefinitely beyond our observable horizon. This is directly analogous to the ancient mariner who would stand on the deck of his ship and see a few miles of ocean around him. That was the world within his horizon, but there was no telling what lay beyond.
Therefore it is important to distinguish the observable universe from the universe as such. Unfortunately, intellectual laziness tended to ignore this distinction and at some point some people who said “universe” to mean just the stretch of our cosmic horizon felt the need to have a new term for whatever may lie beyond. For better or worse, that new term has become wide-spread these days and is “multiverse”.
The main scientific observation that goes with this is the observation that cosmic inflation – for which there is by now excellent and ever increasing experimental evidence that indeed it happened – does, at least by the simple method which is currently used to model it, naturally predict a large ambient space in which local regions stochastically undergo inflationary expansion. This scenario of chaotic inflation has in fact been singled out as the most likely one (within the standard model) by the bicep2-experiment in 2014.
In any case, as far as the observable universe is concerned, two facts are worth noticing:


the observable universe alone is already pretty darn large, see the various discussion of its scales below;


Giordano Bruno‘s old intuition remains plausible even at the largest scales: possibly the full xyz-verse beyond our present horizon is vastly larger still… and we may never know.

Recent measurements (c. 2001) by a number of ground-based and balloon-based experiments, including MAT/TOCO, Boomerang, Maxima, and DASI, have shown that the brightest spots are about 1 degree across. Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know that the universe is flat with only a 2% margin of error

In QCD instanton configurations of the gauge field control the experimentally observed vacuum structure of the theory.
One considers QCD on a Minkowski spacetime Wick rotated to a Euclidean ℝ 4\mathbb{R}^4 and assumes the field strength to vanish at infinity. This makes the gauge field configurations be equivalently SU(3)SU(3)-principal connections on the 4-sphere S 4S^4. The second Chern class of the underlying SU(3)SU(3)-principal bundle is called the Yang-Mills instanton-number of the gauge field configuration. The theoretical/experimentally observed vacuum of QCD is some superposition of gauge fields in various instanton number sectors.
In particular the instanton liquid model in QCD assumes that the vacuum (ground state of QCD) is populated by instanton field configurations of average radius 1/3fm1/3 fm (femtometres) with a density of 1 such instanton per fm 4fm^4. Some details of this model remain subtle, see notably (Schaefer-Shuryak) for a survey.
This instanton sea model suffers however from infrared divergencies that either require a finite-volume cutoff or appeal to other effects (e.g. Witten 98).
But lattice gauge field theory simulations demonstrate numerically that the QCD vacuum is filled with instantons (e.g. Gruber 13, esp. sections 5 and 7). Whether or not their density and distribution may be or has been theoretically derived from first principles is still being discussed (e.g. Schaefer 02)
The Witten-Veneziano formula (Witten 79, Veneziano 79) relates topological instanton charge to the mass of the η′\eta'-particle in the limiting case that the gauge group is SU(N)SU(N) for N→∞N \to \infty. Discussion of this relation for the experimentally observed finite case of N=3N = 3 includes (Creutz 11).
In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.

Decidability

In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
In formal logic such as type theory a term zz is an entity/expression of the formal language which is of some type ZZ. One writes z:Zz : Z to express this (a typing judgement). The semantics of terms in Set is: elements of a set, where one writes z∈Zz \in Z. One also says zz is an inhabitant of the type ZZ and that ZZ is an inhabited type if it has a term.
A term z:Zz : Z may depend on free variables xx that are themselves terms x:Xx : X of some other type XX. For instance z≔x+3z \coloneqq x + 3 may be a term of type Z≔ℤZ \coloneqq \mathbb{Z} (the integers) which depends on a variable term xx also of type X≔ℤX \coloneqq \mathbb{Z} the integers. The notation for this in the metalanguage is
x:X⊢z:Z.
  x : X \vdash z : Z
  \,.


Generally here also the type ZZ itself may depend on the variable xx (hence the term zz may be of different type depending on its free variables) in which case one says that zz is a term of XX-dependent type.
In the metalanguage of type theory called natural deduction, terms are what the term introduction rules produce.
In modern logic, we understand that every variable should have a type, or domain of discourse or be of some sort. For instance we say that if a variable nn is constrained to be an integer then “nn is of integer type” or “of type ℤ\mathbb{Z}”. The usual formal expression from set theory for this – n∈ℤn \in \mathbb{Z} – is then often written n:ℤn \colon \mathbb{Z}
We speak of typed logic if this typing of variables is enforced by the metalanguage. In formulations of a theory the types are often called sorts. More generally, type theory formalizes reasoning with such typed variables. See there for more
(Untyped logic may be seen as simply a special case, in which there is only a single unique type. Thus, untyped logic has one type, not no type.)
Reasoning with types is formalized in natural deduction (which in turn is formalized in a logical framework such as Elf).
Behaviour of types is specified by a 4-step set of rules


type formation


term introduction


term elimination


computation rules


Deep relations between type theory, category theory and computer science relate types to other notions, such as objects in a category. See at computational trinitarianism for more on this.
Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
Dependent type theory is the flavor of type theory that admits dependent types.
Its categorical semantics is in locally cartesian closed categories CC, where a dependent type
x:X⊢E(x)type
  x : X \vdash E(x) \; \mathrm{type}


is interpreted as a morphism E→XE \to X, hence an object in the slice category C /XC_{/X}.
Then change of context corresponds to base change in CC. See also dependent sum and dependent product.
Dependent type systems are heavily used for software certification.
They also seem to support a foundations of mathematics in terms of homotopy type theory.

This (Seely, theorem 6.3). It is somewhat more complicated than this, because we need to strictify the category theory to match the category theory; see categorical model of dependent types. For a more detailed discussion see at relation between type theory and category theory.

Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Semantics is the interpretation of the syntax of a theory in a model.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.

Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

Working in the 1-category Set of 0-categories amounts to doing set theory. The point of sheaf toposes is to pass to parameterized 0-categories, namely presheaf categories. Although these topoi behave much like the 1-topos Set, their objects are generalized spaces that may carry more structure. For instance, a (pre)sheaf on Diff is a generalized smooth space.

The idea of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes is to generalize the above situation from 11 to (∞,1)(\infty,1) (recall the notion of (n,r)-category and see the general discussion at ∞-topos):

Working in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd of (∞,0)-categories amounts to doing homotopy theory. The point of (∞,1)-sheaves is to pass to parameterized (∞,0)-categories, namely (∞,1)-presheaf categories. Although these (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi behave much like the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd, their objects are generalized spaces with higher homotopies that may carry more structure. More generally we have topoi of sheaves, and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi of (∞,1)-sheaves. For instance, an ∞-Lie groupoid is an (∞,1)-sheaf on CartSp.

Global sections geometric morphism
Every ∞-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism to the terminal ∞\infty-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd: the direct image is the global sections (∞,1)-functor Γ\Gamma, the inverse image is the constant ∞-stack functor
(LConst⊣Γ):H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConst∞Grpd.
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


In fact, this is unique, up to equivalence: Since every ∞\infty-groupoid is an 


(
∞
,
1
)

(\infty,1)

-colimit (namely over itself, by this Prop.) of the point (hence of the terminal object), and since the inverse image ∞\infty-functor LConstLConst needs to preserve these ∞\infty-colimits (being a left adjoint) as well as the point (being a lex functor).
Closed monoidal structure

Proposition
Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.


Proof
By the fact that every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits it follows that for every object XX the (∞,1)-functor
X×(−):H→H
  X \times (-) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}


preserves all (∞,1)-colimits. Since every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a locally presentable (∞,1)-category it follows with the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem that there is a right adjoint (∞,1)-functor
(X×(−)⊣[X,−]):H→[X,−]←X×(−)H.
  (X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{X \times (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} \mathbf{H}
  \,.



Proposition
For CC an (∞,1)-site for H\mathbf{H} we have that the internal hom (mapping stack) [X,−][X,-] is given on A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} by the (∞,1)-sheaf
[X,A]:U↦H(X×Ly(U),A),
  [X,A] \,\colon\, U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U), A)
  \,,


where y:C→Hy : C \to \mathbf{H} is the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding and L:PSh C→HL : PSh_C \to \mathbf{H} denotes ∞-stackification.


Proof
The argument is entirely analogous to that of the closed monoidal structure on sheaves.
We use the full and faithful geometric embedding (L⊣i):H↪PSh C(L \dashv i) : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow PSh_C and the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma to find for all U∈CU \in C the value
[X,A](U)≃PSh C(yU,[X,A])
  [X,A](U) \simeq PSh_C(y U, [X,A])


and then the fact that ∞-stackification LL is left adjoint to inclusion to get
⋯≃H(Ly(U),[X,A]).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(L y(U), [X,A])
  \,.


Then the defining adjunction (X×(−)⊣[X,−])(X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) gives
⋯≃H(X×Ly(U),A).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U) , A)
  \,.



Powering of ∞\infty-toposes over ∞\infty-groupoids
We discuss how the powering of 


∞

\infty

-toposes over 


Grpd ∞

Grpd_\infty

 is given by forming mapping stacks out of locally constant 


∞

\infty

-stacks. All of the following formulas and their proogfs hold verbatim also for Grothendieck toposes, as they just use general abstract properties.

Let H\mathbf{H} be an

-topos


with terminal geometric morphism denoted
(1)H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConstGrp ∞,
  
  \mathbf{H}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\;\;\bot\;\;\;\;}
  Grp_\infty
  \,,


where the inverse image constructs locally constant 


∞

\infty

-stacks,


and with its internal hom (mapping stack) adjunction denoted
(2)H⊥⟶Maps(X,−)⟵(−)×XH
  
  \mathbf{H}
    \underoverset
      {\underset{Maps(X,-)}{\longrightarrow}}  
      { \overset{ (-) \times X }{\longleftarrow} }
      {\;\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;\;}
  \mathbf{H}


for X∈HX \,\in\, \mathbf{H}.
Notice that this construction is also 


∞

\infty

-functorial in the first argument: Maps(X→fY,A)Maps\big( X \xrightarrow{f} Y ,\, A \big) is the morphism which under the 


∞

\infty

-Yoneda lemma over H\mathbf{H} (which is large but locally small, so that the lemma does apply) corresponds to


H((−),Maps(X,A))≃H((−)×X,A)→H((−)×f,A)H((−)×Y,A)≃H((−),Maps(X,A)).
  \mathbf{H}
  \big(
    (-)
    ,\,
    Maps(X,A)
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbf{H}

  \xrightarrow{

    \big)   
  }
  \mathbf{H}

    A
  \big)
  \;\simeq\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \big(
    (-)
    ,\,
    Maps(X,A)
  \big)
  \,.


By definition, for any S∈Grpd ∞S \in Grpd_\infty and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the powering] is the (∞,1)-limit over the diagram constant on XX
X K=lim ← KX
  X^K \,=\, {\lim_\leftarrow}_K X


while the tensoring is the (∞,1)-colimit over the diagram constant on XX
K⋅X=lim → KX.
  K \cdot X \,=\, {\lim_{\to}}_K X
  \,.




Remark
Under Isbell duality, the powering operations on homotopy types XX corresponds to higher order Hochschild cohomology of suitable algebras of functions on XX, as discussed there.




Proposition
The powering of H\mathbf{H} over 


Grpd ∞

Grpd_\infty

 is given by the mapping stack out of the locally constant 


∞

\infty

-stacks:
Grpd ∞ op×H ⟶LConst op×id H op×H ⟶Maps(−,−) H
  \array{
    Grpd_\infty^{op}
    \times
    \mathbf{H}
    &
    \overset{ LConst^{op} \times \mathrm{id} }{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathbf{H}^{op}
    \times 
    \mathbf{H}
    &
    \overset{Maps(-,-)}{\longrightarrow}
    &
    \mathbf{H}
  }


in that this operation has the following properties:


For all X,A∈HX,\,A \,\in\, \mathbf{H} and S∈Grpd ∞S \,\in\, Grpd_\infty we have a natural equivalence
H(X,Maps(LConst(S),A))≃Grpd ∞(S,H(X,A))
  \mathbf{H}
  \Big(
    X
    ,\,
    Maps
    \big(

    \mathbf{H}
    \big(
      X
      ,\,

    \big)
  \Big)



In its first argument the operation


sends the terminal object (the point) to the identity:

The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} could be called the gros topos of XX. A geometric morphism K→H\mathbf{K} \to \mathbf{H} that factors as K→≃H /X→πH\mathbf{K} \xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathbf{H}_{/X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} \mathbf{H} is called an etale geometric morphism.
Syntax in univalent homotopy type theory
(∞,1)(\infty,1)-Toposes provide categorical semantics for homotopy type theory with a univalent Tarskian type of types (which inteprets as the object classifier).

relation between type theory and category theory – Univalent homotopy type theory and infinity-toposes


There are various different perspectives on the notion of topos. One is that a topos is a category that looks like a category of spaces that sit by local homeomorphisms over a given base space: all spaces that are locally modeled on a given base space.
The archetypical class of examples are sheaf toposes Sh(X)=Et(X)Sh(X) = Et(X) over a topological space XX: these are the categories of étale spaces over XX, topological spaces YY that are equipped with a local homeomorphisms Y→XY \to X.
When X=*X = * is the point, this is just the category Set of all sets: spaces that are modeled on the point. This is the archetypical topos itself.
What makes the notion of topos powerful is the following fact: even though the general topos contains objects that are considerably different from and possibly considerably richer than plain sets and even richer than étale spaces over a topological space, the general abstract category theoretic properties of every topos are essentially the same as those of Set. For instance in every topos all small limits and colimits exist and it is cartesian closed (even locally). This means that a large number of constructions in Set have immediate analogs internal to every topos, and the analogs of the statements about these constructions that are true in SetSet are true in every topos.
On the one hand this may be thought of as saying that toposes are very nice categories of spaces in that whatever construction on spaces one thinks of – for instance formation of quotients or of fiber products or of mapping spaces – the resulting space with the expected general abstract properties will exist in the topos. In this sense toposes are convenient categories for geometry – as in: convenient category of topological spaces, but even more convenient than that.
On the other hand, by de-emphasizing the geometric interpretation of their objects and just using their good abstract properties, this means that toposes are contexts with a powerful internal logic. The internal logic of toposes is intuitionistic higher order logic. This means that, while the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice may fail, apart from that, every logical statement not depending on these does hold internal to every topos.
For this reason toposes are often studied as abstract contexts “in which one can do mathematics”, independently of their interpretation as categories of spaces. These two points of views on toposes, as being about geometry and about logic at the same time, is part of the richness of topos theory.
On a third hand, however, we can de-emphasize the role of the objects of the topos and instead treat the topos itself as a “generalized space” (and in particular, a categorified space). We then consider the topos Sh(X)Sh(X) as a representative of XX itself, while toposes not of this form are “honestly generalized” spaces. This point of view is supported by the fact that the assignment X↦Sh(X)X\mapsto Sh(X) is a full embedding of (sufficiently nice) topological spaces into toposes, and that many topological properties of a space XX can be detected at the level of Sh(X)Sh(X). (This is even more true once we pass to (∞,1)-toposes.)
From this point of view, the objects of a topos (regarded as a category) should be thought of instead as sheaves on that topos (regarded as a generalized space). And just as sheaves on a topological space can be identified with local homeomorphisms over it, such “sheaves on a topos” (i.e. objects of the topos qua category) can be identified with other toposes that sit over the given topos via a local homeomorphism of toposes.
Finally, mixing this point of view with the second one, we can regard toposes over a given topos EE instead as “toposes in the EE-world of mathematics.” For this reason, the theory of toposes over a given base is formally quite similar to that of arbitrary toposes. And coming full circle, this fact allows the use of “base change arguments” as a very useful technical tool, even if our interest is only in one or two particular toposes qua categories.
‘What a topos is like:’
(i) ‘A topos is a category of sheaves on a site’
(ii) ‘A topos is a category with finite limits and power-objects’
(iii) ‘A topos is (the embodiment of) an intuitionistic higher-order theory’
(iv) ‘A topos is (the extensional essence of) a first-order (infinitary) geometric theory’
(v) ‘A topos is a totally cocomplete object in the meta-2-category CART of cartesian (i.e. , finitely complete) categories’
(vi) ‘A topos is a generalized space’
(vii) ‘A topos is a semantics for intuitionistic formal systems’
(viii) ‘A topos is a Morita equivalence class of continuous groupoids’
(ix) ‘A topos is the category of maps of a power allegory’
(x) ‘A topos is a category whose canonical indexing over itself is complete and well-powered’
(xi) ‘A topos is the spatial manifestation of a giraud frame’
(xii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic differential geometry’
(xiii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic domain theory’,
And so on. But the important thing about the elephant is that ‘however you approach it, it is still the same animal’. Elephant
Extensivity
Every topos is an extensive category. For Grothendieck toposes, infinitary extensivity is part of the characterizing Giraud's theorem. For elementary toposes, see toposes are extensive.
Adhesiveness
Every topos is an adhesive category. For Grothendieck toposes this follows immediately from the adhesion of Set, for elementary toposes it is due to (Lack-Sobocinski).
Epimorphisms
In a topos epimorphisms are stable under pullback and hence the (epi, mono) factorization system in a topos is a stable factorization system.
Relation to abelian categories
While crucially different from abelian categories, there is some intimate relation between toposes and abelian categories. For more on that see AT category.
Reasoning in a topos
Any result in ordinary mathematics whose proof is finitist and constructive automatically holds in any topos. If you remove the restriction that the proof be finitist, then the result holds in any topos with a natural numbers object; if you remove the restrictions that the proof be constructive, then the result holds in any boolean topos. On the other hand, if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in the weaker sense used by constructivists, then the result may fail in some toposes but holds in any Π\Pi-pretopos; if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in a stronger sense, then the result holds in any Heyting pretopos.
Therefore, one can prove results in toposes and similar categories by reasoning, not about the objects and morphisms in the topos themselves, but instead about sets and functions in the normal language of structural set theory, which is more familiar to most mathematicians. One merely has to be careful about what axioms one uses to get results of sufficient generality.
The internal language of a topos is called Mitchell-Bénabou language.
Specific examples and key results


The archetypical topos is Set. Notice that this happens to be a Grothendieck topos: it is the category of sheaves on the point.
The full subcategory FinSet is also an elementary topos, and the inclusion functor FinSet↪SetFinSet \hookrightarrow Set is a logical morphism. This is not a Grothendieck topos.
More generally, for κ\kappa a strong limit cardinal the full subcategory Set κSet_\kappa of sets or cardinality less than κ\kappa is a topos.


For CC any (small) site, the category of sheaves Sh(C)Sh(C) is a Grothendieck topos. Either by definition or by Giraud's theorem, every Grothendieck topos arises in this way. Important examples include:


The case where the Grothendieck topology is the trivial one, so that also all categories of presheaves (on small categories) are (Grothendieck) toposes.


The case of sheaves on (the site given by the category of open subsets of) a topological space, or more generally a locale.


The category GSetG Set of sets equipped with the action of a group GG: this is the topos of presheaves on the category BG\mathbf{B}G which is the delooping groupoid of GG.




Continuing the last example above, if GG is a topological group, the category GSetG Set of sets with a continuous action of G (that is, the action map G×X→XG\times X\to X is continuous, where XX has the discrete topology) is a topos, and in fact a Grothendieck topos (though this may not be obvious).


More generally, GG may be a topological groupoid, or even a localic groupoid. In fact, it is a theorem that every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the topos of “continuous sheaves” on a localic groupoid.


Again if GG is a topological group, the category Unif(G)Unif(G) of uniformly continuous GG-sets is also a topos, but not (in general) one of Grothendieck’s. For example, if GG is the profinite completion of ℤ\mathbb{Z}, then a continuous GG-set is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set all of whose orbits are finite, while a uniformly continuous one is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set with a finite upper bound on the size of all its orbits.


For EE a topos and X∈EX \in E any object, also the overcategory or slice category E/XE/X is again a topos. (Elephant, A.2.3.2). See also over-topos.


If EE is a topos and j:E→Ej \colon E \to E is a lex idempotent monad, the category of jj-algebras is a topos. Each such jj corresponds to a Lawvere-Tierney topology in EE, and the category of jj-algebras is equivalent to the category of sheaves for this topology. An example is the double-negation topology.


An obvious example of an elementary topos that is not a Grothendieck topos is the category FinSet of finite sets. More generally, for any strong limit cardinal κ\kappa, the category of sets of cardinality <κ\lt\kappa is an elementary topos, and as long as κ>ω\kappa \gt\omega it has a NNO. Set <κSet_{\lt \kappa} doesn’t even admit a geometric morphism to SetSet.


Since the definition of elementary topos is “algebraic,” there exist free toposes generated by various kinds of data. The category of toposes (and logical functors) is 2-monadic over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms. It has an initial object which is sometimes called the free topos. More generally, any higher-order type theory (of the sort which can be interpreted in the internal logic of a topos) generates a free topos containing a model of that theory. Such toposes (for a consistent theory) are never Grothendieck’s.


If GG is a large groupoid with a small set of objects, then the category [G,Set][G,Set] (which makes sense if we define “large” and “small” relative to a Grothendieck universe) is a topos, but not in general a Grothendieck topos. Note that this topos is in fact complete and cocomplete, but it does not have a small generating set, and so is an unbounded topos.


If ℱ\mathcal{F} is a filter of subterminal objects in any topos EE, then there is a filterquotient? topos E//ℱE//\mathcal{F}. Grothendieck-ness (and completeness and cocompleteness) are not in general preserved by this construction.


If CC and DD are toposes and F:C→DF\colon C\to D is a lex functor, then there is a topos Gl(F)Gl(F) called the Artin gluing of CC and DD along FF, and defined to be the comma category (D/F)(D/F). If CC and DD are Grothendieck toposes then Gl(F)Gl(F) is a SetSet-topos. If FF is accessible, then Gl(F)Gl(F) is again Grothendieck (hence bounded), but in general it may not be. (Note, though, that it is not clear whether it can be proven in ZFC that there exist any inaccessible lex functors between Grothendieck toposes, although from a proper class of measurable cardinals one can construct an inaccessible lex endofunctor of SetSet.)


The category of coalgebras for any lex comonad on a topos is again a topos: a topos of coalgebras, and if the comonad is accessible, this construction preserves Grothendieck-ness. If the comonad is not accessible, then this topos is unbounded.
For instance the Artin gluing Gl(F)Gl(F) is equivalent to the category of coalgebras for the comonad on the topos C×DC\times D defined by (c,d)↦(c,d×F(c))(c,d) \mapsto (c, d\times F(c)).


More generally, the category of coalgebras for any pullback-preserving comonad on a topos is again a topos. This covers both the preceding result and also the overcategory (slice category) result above, since E/XE/X is the category of coalgebras for the pullback-preserving comonad given by X×−:E→EX \times - \colon E \to E. It also covers Artin gluing along a pullback-preserving functor.


More generally still, Todd Trimble has a notion called a “modal operator” on a topos, from which one can construct a new topos of “GG-structures”: see Three topos theorems in one. Special cases include the pullback-preserving comonad result just mentioned, and the result that the category of algebras for a lex idempotent monad is a topos. A related idea is Toby Kenney’s notion of lex distributive diad?, from which one can also construct a topos.


From any partial combinatory algebra one can construct a realizability topos, whose internal logic is “computable” or “effective” mathematics relative to that PCA. In particular, for Kleene's first algebra, one obtains the effective topos, the most-studied of realizability toposes. Realizability toposes are generally not Grothendieck toposes.


A topos can also be constructed from any tripos. This includes realizability toposes as well as toposes of sheaves on locales.


Classes of examples
For various applications one uses toposes that have extra structure or properties.


In the foundations of mathematics, one often studies well-pointed toposes, especially models of ETCS as potential replacements for the category Set.


In synthetic differential geometry one studies smooth toposes as a context for axiomatic differential geometry.


An (∞,1)-category CC has finite (∞,1)-limits if it has a terminal object and for every object x∈Cx \in C, the over-(∞,1)-category C /xC_{/x} has finite products.
We say that such a CC is locally cartesian closed if moreover C /xC_{/x} is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category for every object xx. This is equivalent to asking that the pullback functor f *:C y→C xf^*\colon C_{\y} \to C_{\x}, for any f:x→yf\colon x\to y in CC, has a right adjoint Π f\Pi_f.
A locally cartesian closed category is a category CC whose slice categories C/xC/x are all cartesian closed.
If a locally cartesian closed category CC has a terminal object, then CC is itself cartesian closed and in fact has all finite limits (because, cartesian products in C/xC/x are pullbacks in CC); often this requirement is included in the definition.
Equivalently, a locally cartesian closed category CC is a category with pullbacks (and a terminal object, if required) such that each base change functor f *:C/y→C/xf^*: C/y \to C/x has a right adjoint Π f\Pi_f, called the dependent product. (This equivalence is discussed in detail below.)
In particular, such pullbacks preserve all colimits. Therefore, if a locally cartesian closed category has finite colimits, it is automatically a coherent category and in fact a Heyting category.
Cartesian closure in terms of base change and dependent product
We show how the dependent product and the internal hom in the slice categories may be used to express each other.
In category theory

Proposition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a category with pullbacks that has all dependent products ∏ •\prod_\bullet, equivalently that every morphism f:E→Xf : E \to X in 𝒞\mathcal{C} induces an adjoint triple
𝒞 /E⟶∏ f⟵f *⟶∑ f𝒞 /X.
  \mathcal{C}_{/E}
    \stackrel{\overset{\sum_f}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_f}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
  \,.


Then the internal hom in a slice 𝒞 /X\mathcal{C}_{/X} exists and is given by
[⟨E⟶fX⟩,−] 𝒞 /X≃∏ f∘f *.
  [\langle E \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} X\rangle \; ,\;  -]_{\mathcal{C}_{/X}}
  \simeq
  \prod_f \circ f^* 
  \,.



Proof
By the discussion at overcategory-Limits and colimits the product in the slice 𝒞 /X\mathcal{C}_{/X} of two objects ⟨E 1⟶f 1X⟩\langle E_1 \stackrel{f_1}{\longrightarrow} X\rangle and ⟨E 2⟶f 2X⟩\langle E_2 \stackrel{f_2}{\longrightarrow} X\rangle is given by the pullback f 1 *E 2=f 2 *E 1f_1^* E_2 = f_2^* E_1 in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regarded again as a morphism over XX. More formally this means that the product with ⟨E→fX⟩\langle E \stackrel{f}{\to} X\rangle  is given by the composite
(−)× 𝒞 /X⟨E→fX⟩:𝒞 /X→f *𝒞 /E→∑ f𝒞 /X 
  (-) \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/X}} \langle E \stackrel{f}{\to} X\rangle
  \;\;\;:\;\;\; 
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
    \stackrel{f^*}{\to}
  \mathcal{C}_{/E}
    \stackrel{\sum_f}{\to}
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}


of the pullback along ff with the dependent sum along ff. By the above adjoint triple both these morphisms have right adjoints and so the composite of the right adjoints is the right adjoint of the composite, hence is the internal hom:
𝒞 /X←∏ f𝒞 /E←f *𝒞 /X:[⟨E→fX⟩,−] 𝒞 /X.
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
    \stackrel{\prod_f}{\leftarrow}
  \mathcal{C}_{/E} 
    \stackrel{f^* }{\leftarrow} \mathcal{C}_{/X}
  \;\;\;:\;\;\;
  [\langle E\stackrel{f}{\to} X \rangle, -]_{\mathcal{C}_{/X}}
  \,.



Example
In the slice category Set/XSet/X, the inner hom is explicitly given by
[⟨E→fX⟩,⟨F→gX⟩] Set/X={(x,h)|x∈X,h:f −1(x)→g −1(x)}. [\langle E \stackrel{f}{\to} X \rangle, \langle F \stackrel{g}{\to} X \rangle]_{Set/X} = \{ (x,h) | x \in X, h : f^{-1}(x) \to g^{-1}(x) \}. 

Proposition
If for a category 𝒞\mathcal{C} every slice category is a cartesian closed category, then for every morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y in 𝒞\mathcal{C} the dependent product ∏ f\prod_f exists and is given on an object E→pXE \stackrel{p}{\to} X by the pullback
∏ f⟨E→pX⟩ → [⟨X→fY⟩,⟨E→pX→fY⟩] 𝒞 /Y ↓  ↓ Y →id¯ [⟨X→fY⟩,⟨X→fY⟩] 𝒞 /Y
  \array{
    \prod_f \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle &\to& [\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y\rangle, \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to}X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\rangle]_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    Y &\stackrel{\bar id}{\to}& [\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle,\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle]_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}}
  }


in 𝒞 /Y\mathcal{C}_{/Y}, where the bottom morphism is the adjunct of
Y× 𝒞 /Y⟨X→fY⟩≃⟨X→fY⟩→id⟨X→fY⟩.
  Y \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}} \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\rangle \simeq \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y\rangle \stackrel{id}{\to} \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y\rangle
  \,.



Proof
It is sufficient to check the (f *⊣∏ f)(f^* \dashv \prod_f)-adjunction hom set-natural isomorphism
𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,∏ f⟨E→pX⟩)≃𝒞 /X(f *⟨F→Y⟩,⟨E→pX⟩),
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}( \langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle , \prod_f \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle)
  \simeq
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}(f^* \langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle, \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle)
  \,,


natural in ⟨F→Y⟩\langle F \stackrel{}{\to}Y \rangle.
Since the hom functor 𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,−)\mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle, -) preserves limits and hence pullbacks, the expression on the left is exhibited as the pullback
𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,∏ f⟨E→pX⟩) → 𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,[⟨X→fY⟩,⟨E→pX→fY⟩] 𝒞 /Y) ↓  ↓ * → 𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,[⟨X→fY⟩,⟨X→fY⟩] 𝒞 /Y)
  \array{
    \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle, \prod_f \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle) &\to& 
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle, [\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle,\langle E \stackrel{p}{\to}X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\rangle]_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}})
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle,[\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle,\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle]_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}})
  }


in Set. Using the ((−)× 𝒞 /Y⟨X→fY⟩⊣[⟨X→fY⟩,−] 𝒞 /Y)((-) \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}} \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y\rangle \dashv [\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y\rangle, -]_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}})-adjunction this is equivalently
𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩,∏ f⟨E→pX⟩) → 𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩× 𝒞 /Y⟨X→fY⟩,⟨E→pX→fY⟩) ↓  ↓ * → 𝒞 /Y(⟨F→Y⟩× 𝒞 /Y⟨X→fY⟩,⟨X→fY⟩).
  \array{
    \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle, \prod_f \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle) 
    &\to& 
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y}} \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle, \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to}X \stackrel{f}{\to} Y\rangle)
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    * &\stackrel{}{\to}& 
    \mathcal{C}_{/Y}(\langle F \stackrel{}{\to} Y\rangle \times_{\mathcal{C}_{/Y} }\langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle ,
   \langle X \stackrel{f}{\to}Y \rangle)
  }
  \,.


This pullback now manifestly computes 𝒞 /X(f *⟨F→Y⟩,⟨E→pX⟩)\mathcal{C}_{/X}(f^* \langle F \to Y\rangle, \langle E \stackrel{p}{\to} X\rangle).


Proposition
If CC is locally cartesian closed (i.e., if every slice C/XC/X is cartesian closed), then every slice C/XC/X is also locally cartesian closed.


Proof
The slice of a slice is a slice, i.e., for every f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y there is an equivalence
(C/Y)/(f:X→Y)≃C/X(C/Y)/(f \colon X \to Y) \simeq C/X
whence the statement immediately follows.


Proposition
If CC is locally cartesian closed (and has a terminal object), then the pullback functor X×−:C→C/XX \times - \colon C \to C/X preserves both finite products and exponentials up to isomorphism.


Proof
Clearly X×−:C→C/xX \times - \colon C \to C/x, being right adjoint to the forgetful functor ∑ X:C/X→C\sum_X \colon C/X \to C, preserves limits, hence it preserves finite products in particular.
Let ϕ:A→X\phi \colon A \to X be any morphism. From the pullback diagram
A×Z →ϕ×1 X×Z π A↓  ↓ π X A →ϕ X\array{
A \times Z & \stackrel{\phi \times 1}{\to} & X \times Z \\
 _\mathllap{\pi_A} \downarrow & & \downarrow _\mathrlap{\pi_X} \\
A & \underset{\phi}{\to} & X
}

we conclude A× X(X×Z)≅A×ZA \times_X (X \times Z) \cong A \times Z, seen as an object over XX via ϕ∘π A:A×Z→X\phi \circ \pi_A \colon A \times Z \to X. Thus arrows in the slice C/XC/X of the form
A× X(X×Z)→X×YA \times_X (X \times Z) \to X \times Y
are in natural bijection with arrows in CC of the form
A×Z→⟨ϕ∘π A,g⟩X×YA \times Z \stackrel{\langle \phi \circ \pi_A, g\rangle}{\to} X \times Y
which in turn are in natural bijection with arrows in the slice C/XC/X of the form
A→⟨ϕ,g˜⟩X×Y ZA \stackrel{\langle \phi, \tilde{g} \rangle}{\to} X \times Y^Z
(where g˜:A→Y Z\tilde{g} \colon A \to Y^Z is obtained by currying g:A×Z→Yg \colon A \times Z \to Y in CC). This proves that X×−:C→C/xX \times - \colon C \to C/x preserves exponentials.


Corollary
For any f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y in CC, the base change f *:C/Y→C/Xf^\ast \colon C/Y \to C/X preserves exponentials. In other words, the dependent sum functor ∑ f\sum_f and the dependent product functor ∏ f\prod_f satisfy Frobenius reciprocity.


Proof
This is by combining proposition  and proposition , and recalling that the pullback functor
C/Y→(C/Y)/(f:X→Y)≃C/XC/Y \to (C/Y)/(f \colon X \to Y) \simeq C/X
is identified with the pullback functor f *:C/Y→C/Xf^\ast \colon C/Y \to C/X.

This state of affairs may be summarized in terms of the notion of hyperdoctrine:

Proposition
If CC is a category with finite limits, then it is locally cartesian closed precisely if regarded as an CC-indexed category (by forming slice categories) it is a hyperdoctrine.

For a proof of the statement in this form, see for instance (Freyd).
In type theory
We formulate some of the above considerations in the syntax of dependent type theory.

Proposition
Let
X    A   ϕ↘  ↙ c   B
  \array{
     X &&&& A
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\phi}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{c}}
     \\
     && 
     B
  }


be two display maps. Then the category theoretic identification
[X,A] B=∏ ϕϕ *⟨A→cB⟩
  [X,A]_{B} = \prod_\phi \phi^* \langle A \stackrel{c}{\to} B\rangle


from prop.  is the categorical semantics of the dependent type theory syntax
b:B⊢X(b)→A(b):Type= defb:B⊢∏ x:X(b)A(ϕ(x)).
  b : B \vdash X(b) \to A(b) : Type
  \;\;\;
  =_{def}
  \;\;\;
  b : B \vdash \prod_{x : X(b)} A(\phi(x))
  \,.



Remark
While equivalent under the relation between type theory and category theory, the latter expression almost verbatim expresses the evident idea that:
(collection of internal homs parameterized over BB) = ( collection of sections of the pullback of AA to XX )


Proof
By definition, the display map on the right is expressed as the dependent type
b:B⊢A(b):Type,
  b : B \vdash A(b) : Type
  \,,


the pullback ϕ *⟨A→B⟩\phi^* \langle A \to B\rangle is expressed by substitution
x:X⊢A(ϕ(x)):Type
   x : X \vdash A(\phi(x)) : Type


and next the dependent product ∏ ϕϕ *⟨A→B⟩\prod_\phi \phi^* \langle A \to B\rangle by
b:B⊢∏ x:X(b)A(ϕ(x)):Type.
   b : B  \vdash \prod_{x : X(b)} A(\phi(x)) : Type
  \,.


Now on the right ϕ(x)= defb\phi(x) =_{def} b, formally because ϕ\phi is equivalently the projection pr 1pr_1 out of XX expressed as the direct sum
(b,x):∑ b:BX(b)pr 1(b,x)= defb= defϕ(x):B.
  \frac{(b,x) :  \sum_{b : B} X(b)}
   { pr_1(b,x) =_{def} b =_{def} \phi(x)  : B}
  \,.


Inserting this in the above expression makes it definitionally equal to
b:B⊢∏ x:X(b)A(b):Type.
   b : B  \vdash \prod_{x : X(b)} A(b) : Type
  \,.


This is now a dependent product over a type that does not actually depend on the context BB, and hence by definition this is the dependent function type
b:B⊢X(b)→A(b):Type.
  b : B \vdash X(b) \to A(b) : Type  
  \,.


which expresses the internal hom in the slice over BB.

Internal logic
The internal logic of locally cartesian closed categories is an extensional form of dependent type theory. In particular, the dependent product Π f\Pi_f represents an extensional dependent product type in the internal logic.
Almost local cartesian closure
There are categories which are cartesian closed and not locally cartesian closed, but in which for some ff the base change functor f *:C/y→C/xf^*: C/y \to C/x has a right adjoint. This includes CatCat, GpdGpd, and the category of crossed complexes; in the latter two cases, it is necessary and sufficient for ff to be a fibration, while in CatCat it is sufficient for ff to be a fibration or an opfibration.
There are various different perspectives on the notion of topos. One is that a topos is a category that looks like a category of spaces that sit by local homeomorphisms over a given base space: all spaces that are locally modeled on a given base space.
The archetypical class of examples are sheaf toposes Sh(X)=Et(X)Sh(X) = Et(X) over a topological space XX: these are the categories of étale spaces over XX, topological spaces YY that are equipped with a local homeomorphisms Y→XY \to X.
When X=*X = * is the point, this is just the category Set of all sets: spaces that are modeled on the point. This is the archetypical topos itself.
What makes the notion of topos powerful is the following fact: even though the general topos contains objects that are considerably different from and possibly considerably richer than plain sets and even richer than étale spaces over a topological space, the general abstract category theoretic properties of every topos are essentially the same as those of Set. For instance in every topos all small limits and colimits exist and it is cartesian closed (even locally). This means that a large number of constructions in Set have immediate analogs internal to every topos, and the analogs of the statements about these constructions that are true in SetSet are true in every topos.
On the one hand this may be thought of as saying that toposes are very nice categories of spaces in that whatever construction on spaces one thinks of – for instance formation of quotients or of fiber products or of mapping spaces – the resulting space with the expected general abstract properties will exist in the topos. In this sense toposes are convenient categories for geometry – as in: convenient category of topological spaces, but even more convenient than that.
On the other hand, by de-emphasizing the geometric interpretation of their objects and just using their good abstract properties, this means that toposes are contexts with a powerful internal logic. The internal logic of toposes is intuitionistic higher order logic. This means that, while the law of excluded middle and the axiom of choice may fail, apart from that, every logical statement not depending on these does hold internal to every topos.
For this reason toposes are often studied as abstract contexts “in which one can do mathematics”, independently of their interpretation as categories of spaces. These two points of views on toposes, as being about geometry and about logic at the same time, is part of the richness of topos theory.
On a third hand, however, we can de-emphasize the role of the objects of the topos and instead treat the topos itself as a “generalized space” (and in particular, a categorified space). We then consider the topos Sh(X)Sh(X) as a representative of XX itself, while toposes not of this form are “honestly generalized” spaces. This point of view is supported by the fact that the assignment X↦Sh(X)X\mapsto Sh(X) is a full embedding of (sufficiently nice) topological spaces into toposes, and that many topological properties of a space XX can be detected at the level of Sh(X)Sh(X). (This is even more true once we pass to (∞,1)-toposes.)
From this point of view, the objects of a topos (regarded as a category) should be thought of instead as sheaves on that topos (regarded as a generalized space). And just as sheaves on a topological space can be identified with local homeomorphisms over it, such “sheaves on a topos” (i.e. objects of the topos qua category) can be identified with other toposes that sit over the given topos via a local homeomorphism of toposes.
Finally, mixing this point of view with the second one, we can regard toposes over a given topos EE instead as “toposes in the EE-world of mathematics.” For this reason, the theory of toposes over a given base is formally quite similar to that of arbitrary toposes. And coming full circle, this fact allows the use of “base change arguments” as a very useful technical tool, even if our interest is only in one or two particular toposes qua categories.
‘What a topos is like:’
(i) ‘A topos is a category of sheaves on a site’
(ii) ‘A topos is a category with finite limits and power-objects’
(iii) ‘A topos is (the embodiment of) an intuitionistic higher-order theory’
(iv) ‘A topos is (the extensional essence of) a first-order (infinitary) geometric theory’
(v) ‘A topos is a totally cocomplete object in the meta-2-category CART of cartesian (i.e. , finitely complete) categories’
(vi) ‘A topos is a generalized space’
(vii) ‘A topos is a semantics for intuitionistic formal systems’
(viii) ‘A topos is a Morita equivalence class of continuous groupoids’
(ix) ‘A topos is the category of maps of a power allegory’
(x) ‘A topos is a category whose canonical indexing over itself is complete and well-powered’
(xi) ‘A topos is the spatial manifestation of a giraud frame’
(xii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic differential geometry’
(xiii) ‘A topos is a setting for synthetic domain theory’,
And so on. But the important thing about the elephant is that ‘however you approach it, it is still the same animal’. Elephant
Extensivity
Every topos is an extensive category. For Grothendieck toposes, infinitary extensivity is part of the characterizing Giraud's theorem. For elementary toposes, see toposes are extensive.
Adhesiveness
Every topos is an adhesive category. For Grothendieck toposes this follows immediately from the adhesion of Set, for elementary toposes it is due to (Lack-Sobocinski).
Epimorphisms
In a topos epimorphisms are stable under pullback and hence the (epi, mono) factorization system in a topos is a stable factorization system.
Relation to abelian categories
While crucially different from abelian categories, there is some intimate relation between toposes and abelian categories. For more on that see AT category.
Reasoning in a topos
Any result in ordinary mathematics whose proof is finitist and constructive automatically holds in any topos. If you remove the restriction that the proof be finitist, then the result holds in any topos with a natural numbers object; if you remove the restrictions that the proof be constructive, then the result holds in any boolean topos. On the other hand, if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in the weaker sense used by constructivists, then the result may fail in some toposes but holds in any Π\Pi-pretopos; if you add the restriction that the proof be predicative in a stronger sense, then the result holds in any Heyting pretopos.
Therefore, one can prove results in toposes and similar categories by reasoning, not about the objects and morphisms in the topos themselves, but instead about sets and functions in the normal language of structural set theory, which is more familiar to most mathematicians. One merely has to be careful about what axioms one uses to get results of sufficient generality.
The internal language of a topos is called Mitchell-Bénabou language.
Specific examples and key results


The archetypical topos is Set. Notice that this happens to be a Grothendieck topos: it is the category of sheaves on the point.
The full subcategory FinSet is also an elementary topos, and the inclusion functor FinSet↪SetFinSet \hookrightarrow Set is a logical morphism. This is not a Grothendieck topos.
More generally, for κ\kappa a strong limit cardinal the full subcategory Set κSet_\kappa of sets or cardinality less than κ\kappa is a topos.


For CC any (small) site, the category of sheaves Sh(C)Sh(C) is a Grothendieck topos. Either by definition or by Giraud's theorem, every Grothendieck topos arises in this way. Important examples include:


The case where the Grothendieck topology is the trivial one, so that also all categories of presheaves (on small categories) are (Grothendieck) toposes.


The case of sheaves on (the site given by the category of open subsets of) a topological space, or more generally a locale.


The category GSetG Set of sets equipped with the action of a group GG: this is the topos of presheaves on the category BG\mathbf{B}G which is the delooping groupoid of GG.




Continuing the last example above, if GG is a topological group, the category GSetG Set of sets with a continuous action of G (that is, the action map G×X→XG\times X\to X is continuous, where XX has the discrete topology) is a topos, and in fact a Grothendieck topos (though this may not be obvious).


More generally, GG may be a topological groupoid, or even a localic groupoid. In fact, it is a theorem that every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the topos of “continuous sheaves” on a localic groupoid.


Again if GG is a topological group, the category Unif(G)Unif(G) of uniformly continuous GG-sets is also a topos, but not (in general) one of Grothendieck’s. For example, if GG is the profinite completion of ℤ\mathbb{Z}, then a continuous GG-set is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set all of whose orbits are finite, while a uniformly continuous one is a ℤ\mathbb{Z}-set with a finite upper bound on the size of all its orbits.


For EE a topos and X∈EX \in E any object, also the overcategory or slice category E/XE/X is again a topos. (Elephant, A.2.3.2). See also over-topos.


If EE is a topos and j:E→Ej \colon E \to E is a lex idempotent monad, the category of jj-algebras is a topos. Each such jj corresponds to a Lawvere-Tierney topology in EE, and the category of jj-algebras is equivalent to the category of sheaves for this topology. An example is the double-negation topology.


An obvious example of an elementary topos that is not a Grothendieck topos is the category FinSet of finite sets. More generally, for any strong limit cardinal κ\kappa, the category of sets of cardinality <κ\lt\kappa is an elementary topos, and as long as κ>ω\kappa \gt\omega it has a NNO. Set <κSet_{\lt \kappa} doesn’t even admit a geometric morphism to SetSet.


Since the definition of elementary topos is “algebraic,” there exist free toposes generated by various kinds of data. The category of toposes (and logical functors) is 2-monadic over the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms. It has an initial object which is sometimes called the free topos. More generally, any higher-order type theory (of the sort which can be interpreted in the internal logic of a topos) generates a free topos containing a model of that theory. Such toposes (for a consistent theory) are never Grothendieck’s.


If GG is a large groupoid with a small set of objects, then the category [G,Set][G,Set] (which makes sense if we define “large” and “small” relative to a Grothendieck universe) is a topos, but not in general a Grothendieck topos. Note that this topos is in fact complete and cocomplete, but it does not have a small generating set, and so is an unbounded topos.


If ℱ\mathcal{F} is a filter of subterminal objects in any topos EE, then there is a filterquotient? topos E//ℱE//\mathcal{F}. Grothendieck-ness (and completeness and cocompleteness) are not in general preserved by this construction.


If CC and DD are toposes and F:C→DF\colon C\to D is a lex functor, then there is a topos Gl(F)Gl(F) called the Artin gluing of CC and DD along FF, and defined to be the comma category (D/F)(D/F). If CC and DD are Grothendieck toposes then Gl(F)Gl(F) is a SetSet-topos. If FF is accessible, then Gl(F)Gl(F) is again Grothendieck (hence bounded), but in general it may not be. (Note, though, that it is not clear whether it can be proven in ZFC that there exist any inaccessible lex functors between Grothendieck toposes, although from a proper class of measurable cardinals one can construct an inaccessible lex endofunctor of SetSet.)


The category of coalgebras for any lex comonad on a topos is again a topos: a topos of coalgebras, and if the comonad is accessible, this construction preserves Grothendieck-ness. If the comonad is not accessible, then this topos is unbounded.
For instance the Artin gluing Gl(F)Gl(F) is equivalent to the category of coalgebras for the comonad on the topos C×DC\times D defined by (c,d)↦(c,d×F(c))(c,d) \mapsto (c, d\times F(c)).


More generally, the category of coalgebras for any pullback-preserving comonad on a topos is again a topos. This covers both the preceding result and also the overcategory (slice category) result above, since E/XE/X is the category of coalgebras for the pullback-preserving comonad given by X×−:E→EX \times - \colon E \to E. It also covers Artin gluing along a pullback-preserving functor.


More generally still, Todd Trimble has a notion called a “modal operator” on a topos, from which one can construct a new topos of “GG-structures”: see Three topos theorems in one. Special cases include the pullback-preserving comonad result just mentioned, and the result that the category of algebras for a lex idempotent monad is a topos. A related idea is Toby Kenney’s notion of lex distributive diad?, from which one can also construct a topos.


From any partial combinatory algebra one can construct a realizability topos, whose internal logic is “computable” or “effective” mathematics relative to that PCA. In particular, for Kleene's first algebra, one obtains the effective topos, the most-studied of realizability toposes. Realizability toposes are generally not Grothendieck toposes.


A topos can also be constructed from any tripos. This includes realizability toposes as well as toposes of sheaves on locales.


Classes of examples
For various applications one uses toposes that have extra structure or properties.


In the foundations of mathematics, one often studies well-pointed toposes, especially models of ETCS as potential replacements for the category Set.


In synthetic differential geometry one studies smooth toposes as a context for axiomatic differential geometry.



Der unendlich kleinste Theil des Raumes ist immer ein Raum, etwas, das Continuität hat, nicht aber ein blosser Punct, oder die Grenze zwischen bestimmten Stellen im Raume; (Fichte 1795, Grundriss, §4.IV)

In synthetic differential geometry one formulates differential geometry axiomatically in toposes – called smooth toposes – of generalized smooth spaces by assuming the explicit existence of infinitesimal neighbourhoods of points.
The main point of the axioms is to ensure that a well defined notion of infinitesimal spaces exists in the topos, whose existence concretely and usefully formalizes the wide-spread but often vague intuition about the role of infinitesimals in differential geometry.
In particular, in such toposes EE there exists an infinitesimal space DD that behaves like the infinitesimal interval in such a way that for any space X∈EX \in E the tangent bundle of XX, is, again as an object of the topos, just the internal hom TX:=X DT X \;\text{:=}\; X^D (using the notation of exponential objects in the cartesian closed category EE). So a tangent vector in this context is literally an infinitesimal path in XX.
This way, in smooth toposes it is possible to give precise well-defined meaning to many of the familiar computations – wide-spread in particular in the physics literature – that compute with supposedly “infinitesimal” quantities.

Remark
As quoted by Anders Kock in his first book (p. 9), Sophus Lie – one of the founding fathers of differential geometry and, of course Lie theory – once said that he found his main theorems in Lie theory using “synthetic reasoning”, but had to write them up in non-synthetic style (see analytic versus synthetic) just due to lack of a formalized language:

“The reason why I have postponed for so long these investigations, which are basic to my other work in this field, is essentially the following. I found these theories originally by synthetic considerations. But I soon realized that, as expedient ( zweckmässig ) the synthetic method is for discovery, as difficult it is to give a clear exposition on synthetic investigations, which deal with objects that till now have almost exclusively been considered analytically. After long vacillations, I have decided to use a half synthetic, half analytic form. I hope my work will serve to bring justification to the synthetic method besides the analytical one.” (Sophus Lie, Allgemeine Theorie der partiellen Differentialgleichungen erster Ordnung, Math. Ann. 9 (1876).)


Synthetic differential geometry provides this formalized language.

Remark
Another advocate of the use of infinitesimals in the late 19th century was the American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce:

The illumination of the subject by a strict notation for the logic of relatives had shown me clearly and evidently that the idea of an infinitesimal involves no contradiction…As a mathematician, I prefer the method of infinitesimals to that of limits, as far easier and less infested with snares. Charles Sanders Peirce, The Law of Mind, The Monist 2 (1892)

According to Bell (1998, p.5):

Peirce was aware, even before Brouwer, that a faithful account of the truly continuous will involve jettisoning the law of excluded(.)


Classically, we have:

A Grothendieck topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} is a category that admits a geometric embedding
𝒯↪←lexPSh(C)
  \mathcal{T} \stackrel{\stackrel{lex}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)


in a presheaf category, i.e., a full and faithful functor that has a left exact left adjoint.
This is equivalently the category of sheaves (Set-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a small site.

See at sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes for discussion of this characterization.
Since smallness can be relative, we also have:

For a given fixed category of sets SS, a Grothendieck topos over SS is a category of sheaves (SS-valued presheaves satisfying the sheaf condition) over a site which is small relative to SS, that is a site internal to SS.

Note that a Grothendieck topos is a topos because (or if) SS is.
The site is not considered part of the structure; different sites may give rise to equivalent category of sheaves.
By the general theory of geometric morphisms, every Grothendieck topos sits inside a category of presheaves by a geometric embedding Sh(S)↪PSh(S)Sh(S) \hookrightarrow PSh(S).


This may be taken as an alternative definition of sheaf: since Lawvere-Tierney topologies are bijectively given by geometric embeddings, instead of explicitly defining a sheaf as a presheaf satisfying descent, one may define categories of sheaves as geometric embeddings into presheaf categories.


For details on the relation between the two perspectives see geometric embedding.


This perspective is useful for defining the vertical categorification of sheaves: stacks and ∞-stacks: the higher categories of these may be defined as geometric embeddings into higher categories of presheaves. This has been worked out in detail for (∞,1)-categories. See (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves.


Sometimes it is useful to distinguish between petit topos and gros topos.


General

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a locally presentable category.

(Borceux 94, vol 3, prop. 3.4.16)

Proposition
Every Grothendieck topos is a total category and a cototal category.


Proof
From the page total category, totality follows from the fact that a Grothendieck topos is

Cocomplete,
Well-copowered (because quotient objects of an object XX are in bijection with equivalence relations on XX, and there is a small set of these because a Grothendieck topos is well-powered), and
Has a generator (e.g., the coproduct of all representables for a small site presentation).

Dually, a Grothendieck topos is

Complete,
Well-powered (because subobjects of an object XX are in bijection with elements of a small hom-set hom(X,Ω)\hom(X, \Omega)), and
Has a cogenerator (e.g., the product of power objects Ω c\Omega^c where cc ranges over representables for a small site presentation).

Therefore a Grothendieck topos is also cototal.

Giraud's axiomatic characterization
Giraud characterized Grothendieck toposes as categories satisfying certain exactness and small completeness properties (where “small” is again relative to the given category of sets SS). The exactness properties are elementary (not depending on SS), and are satisfied in any elementary topos, or even a pretopos.
Giraud's theorem characterises a Grothendieck topos as follows:

a locally small category with a small generating set,
with all finite limits,
with all small coproducts, which are disjoint, and pullback-stable,
where all congruences have effective quotient objects, which are also pullback-stable.

These conditions are equivalent to

a locally small infinitary pretopos with a small generating set.

See the Elephant, theorem C.2.2.8. (There, the assumption of local smallness is not stated explicitly, but it is included in the definition of ∞\infty-pretopos by way of well-poweredness; on the nLab it is not so included, so we have to state it explicitly. To see that it is necessary, note that if UU and VV are Grothendieck universes with U∈VU\in V, then Set VSet_V satisfies all the other conditions relative to Set USet_U, but is not locally small and is not a Grothendieck topos.) See also Wikipedia.
Sometimes (3,4) are combined and strengthened to the statement that the category has all small colimits, which are effective and pullback-stable. However, this is a mistake for two reasons: it is a significantly stronger axiomatisation (since without the small generating set, not every infinitary pretopos has this property), and it is not valid in weak foundations (while the definition given above is).
Street’s axiomatic characterization
Augmenting the aforementioned Proposition  that Grothendieck toposes are total categories, Street more or less characterizes Grothendieck toposes as lex total categories having the same “size” as SetSet.
In more detail: we take as background set theory ZFC + “there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal” κ\kappa; equivalently, the existence of a single Grothendieck universe UU (a set of “small sets”). Supposing given a model VV of ZFC+universeZFC+universe, “category” shall then refer to category theory interpreted in VV. Let SetSet be the category of small sets; note that the set of morphisms of SetSet has size κ\kappa.
Recall that locally small category EE is lex total if the Yoneda embedding y:E→[E op,Set]y: E \to [E^{op}, Set] has a left exact left adjoint.

Theorem
(Street) A category EE is a Grothendieck topos iff it is lex total and the size of the set of isomorphism classes of objects is κ\kappa or less.


Remark
This result is in the spirit of saying “every Grothendieck topos is the category of sheaves with respect to the canonical topology on itself”. Putting aside set-theoretic issues, it suggests that Grothendieck toposes be seen as analogous to frames, which may be defined as lex total objects in 2\mathbf{2}-CatCat. In this setting, the appropriate morphisms are left exact left adjoints, so that Grothendieck toposes and geometric morphisms between them would be analogous to locales and continuous maps between them.
One can deduce formally that lex total categories are locally cartesian closed Heyting pretoposes.

As lex reflections of categories of presheaves
sheaf toposes are equivalently the left exact reflective subcategories of presheaf toposes
As localic groupoids
Every Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the classifying topos of a localic groupoid, every Grothendieck topos with enough points is equivalent to the classifying topos of a topological groupoid, and in fact the 2-category Topos of Grothendieck toposes is equivalent to a localization of that of localic groupoids.
See at classifying topos of a localic groupoid for more.
Internal logic
Being an elementary topos, a Grothendieck has an internal logic that can be taken to be higher-order logic or a form of dependent type theory. It is also useful to take its internal geometric logic, in particular because that is preserved by geometric morphisms and because every geometric theory has a Grothendieck classifying topos.
Although the internal logic of a Grothendieck topos is constructive logic, there are a number of principles that are true in every Grothendieck topos (at least, assuming the base topos Set is classical) but are not constructively provable (and in particular can fail in other toposes). Roughly speaking, many of these axioms assert that classicality fails “in only a small way”. These include:

WISC: every set has a weakly initial set of covers.
The (constructive) axiom of multiple choice (AMC).
The axiom of stack completions.
(allegedly) the local small cardinality selection axiom (SCSA).
Every complete small category is a preorder.


Definition
SmoothManifoldsSmoothManifolds is the category whose


objects are smooth manifolds


morphisms are smooth functions between these.


Similarly, for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}
DifferentiableManifolds nDifferentiableManifolds_n is the category whose


objects are differentiable manifolds


morphisms are differentiable functions between these


for nn-fold differentiabiliy.
Each of these categories is also commonly denoted ManMan or MfdMfd or Diff etc.

As a site

Proposition
The category SmoothManifoldsSmoothManifolds becomes a large site by equipping it with the coverage consisting of open covers.
This is an essentially small site: a dense sub-site for SmoothManifoldsSmoothManifolds is given by CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}.


Proof
The first statement follows trivially as for Top: the preimage of an open subset under a continuous function is again open (by definition of continuouss function).
For the second statement one needs that every paracompact manifold admits a differentially good open cover : an open cover by open balls that are diffeomorphic to a Cartesian spaces. The proof for this is spelled out at good open cover.


Corollary
The sheaf topos over SmoothManifoldsSmoothManifolds is a cohesive topos.
The hypercompletion of the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos over SmoothManifoldsSmoothManifolds is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
For the first statement, use that by the comparison lemma discussed at dense sub-site we have an equivalence of categories
Sh(SmoothManifolds)≃Sh(CartSp smooth).
  Sh(SmoothManifolds) \simeq Sh(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.


By the discussion at CartSp we have that CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} is a cohesive site. By the discussion there the claim follows.
For the second statement observe that the Joyal-Jardine model structure on simplicial sheaves Sh(SmoothManifolds) loc Δ opSh(SmoothManifolds)^{\Delta^{op}}_{loc} is a presentation for the hypercompletion of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothManifolds)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothManifolds) (see presentations of (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-toposes). By the above result it follows that there is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories between the hypercompletions
Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothManifolds)≃Sh^ (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothManifolds) \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.


Now CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is even an ∞-cohesive site. By the discussion there it follows that Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth}) (before hypercompletion) is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. This means that it is in particular a local (∞,1)-topos. But this implies (as discussed there), that the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves already is the hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos. Therefore finally
⋯≃Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  \cdots \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.



Remark
The cohesive topos Sh(SmoothManifolds)≃Sh(CartSp smooth)Sh(SmoothManifolds) \simeq Sh(CartSp_{smooth}) is in particular the home of diffeological spaces. See there for more details.
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos
Smooth∞Grp:=Sh (∞,1)(SmoothManifolds)≃Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth)
  Smooth \infty Grp := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothManifolds) \simeq Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})


is that of smooth ∞-groupoids. Discussed at Smooth∞Grpd.
The theory of differentiable stacks is that of geometric stacks in the (2,1)-sheaf (2,1)-topos
Sh (2,1)(SmoothManifolds)≃Sh (2,1)(CartSp smooth)≃τ ≤1Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth)
  Sh_{(2,1)}(SmoothManifolds) \simeq Sh_{(2,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
   \simeq 
  \tau_{\leq 1} Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})


Recall the following familiar 1-categorical statement:

Working in the 1-category Set of 0-categories amounts to doing set theory. The point of sheaf toposes is to pass to parameterized 0-categories, namely presheaf categories. Although these topoi behave much like the 1-topos Set, their objects are generalized spaces that may carry more structure. For instance, a (pre)sheaf on Diff is a generalized smooth space.

The idea of (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes is to generalize the above situation from 11 to (∞,1)(\infty,1) (recall the notion of (n,r)-category and see the general discussion at ∞-topos):

Working in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd of (∞,0)-categories amounts to doing homotopy theory. The point of (∞,1)-sheaves is to pass to parameterized (∞,0)-categories, namely (∞,1)-presheaf categories. Although these (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi behave much like the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd, their objects are generalized spaces with higher homotopies that may carry more structure. More generally we have topoi of sheaves, and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topoi of (∞,1)-sheaves. For instance, an ∞-Lie groupoid is an (∞,1)-sheaf on CartSp.

Global sections geometric morphism
Every ∞-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism to the terminal ∞\infty-stack (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos ∞Grpd: the direct image is the global sections (∞,1)-functor Γ\Gamma, the inverse image is the constant ∞-stack functor
(LConst⊣Γ):H⊥⟶Γ⟵LConst∞Grpd.
  (LConst \dashv \Gamma) 
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{H}
  \underoverset
    {\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}
    {\overset{LConst}{\longleftarrow}}
    {\;\;\; \bot \;\;\;}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


In fact, this is unique, up to equivalence: Since every ∞\infty-groupoid is an 


(
∞
,
1
)

(\infty,1)

-colimit (namely over itself, by this Prop.) of the point (hence of the terminal object), and since the inverse image ∞\infty-functor LConstLConst needs to preserve these ∞\infty-colimits (being a left adjoint) as well as the point (being a lex functor).
Closed monoidal structure

Proposition
Every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.


Proof
By the fact that every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits it follows that for every object XX the (∞,1)-functor
X×(−):H→H
  X \times (-) : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{H}


preserves all (∞,1)-colimits. Since every (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is a locally presentable (∞,1)-category it follows with the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem that there is a right adjoint (∞,1)-functor
(X×(−)⊣[X,−]):H→[X,−]←X×(−)H.
  (X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) : \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{X \times (-)}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{[X,-]}{\to}} \mathbf{H}

For CC an (∞,1)-site for H\mathbf{H} we have that the internal hom (mapping stack) [X,−][X,-] is given on A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} by the (∞,1)-sheaf
[X,A]:U↦H(X×Ly(U),A),
  [X,A] \,\colon\, U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U), A)
  \,,


where y:C→Hy : C \to \mathbf{H} is the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding and L:PSh C→HL : PSh_C \to \mathbf{H} denotes ∞-stackification.


Proof
The argument is entirely analogous to that of the closed monoidal structure on sheaves.
We use the full and faithful geometric embedding (L⊣i):H↪PSh C(L \dashv i) : \mathbf{H} \hookrightarrow PSh_C and the (∞,1)-Yoneda lemma to find for all U∈CU \in C the value
[X,A](U)≃PSh C(yU,[X,A])
  [X,A](U) \simeq PSh_C(y U, [X,A])


and then the fact that ∞-stackification LL is left adjoint to inclusion to get
⋯≃H(Ly(U),[X,A]).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(L y(U), [X,A])
  \,.


Then the defining adjunction (X×(−)⊣[X,−])(X \times (-) \dashv [X,-]) gives
⋯≃H(X×Ly(U),A).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(X \times L y(U) , A)
  \,.



Powering of ∞\infty-toposes over ∞\infty-groupoids
We discuss how the powering of 


∞

-toposes over 


Grpd ∞

Grpd_\infty

 is given by forming mapping stacks out of locally constant 


∞

\infty

-stacks. All of the following formulas and their proogfs hold verbatim also for Grothendieck toposes, as they just use general abstract properties.

Let H\mathbf{H} be an

where the inverse image constructs locally constant

and with its internal hom (mapping stack) adjunction denoted

for X∈HX \,\in\, \mathbf{H}.

By definition, for any S∈Grpd ∞S \in Grpd_\infty and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the powering] is the (∞,1)-limit over the diagram constant on XX
X K=lim ← KX
  X^K \,=\, {\lim_\leftarrow}_K X


while the tensoring is the (∞,1)-colimit over the diagram constant on XX
K⋅X=lim → KX.
  K \cdot X \,=\, {\lim_{\to}}_K X
  \,.




Remark
Under Isbell duality, the powering operations on homotopy types XX corresponds to higher order Hochschild cohomology of suitable algebras of functions on XX, as discussed there.




Proposition
The powering of H\mathbf{H} over

 is given by the mapping stack out of the locally constant

    \times 
    \mathbf{H}
    &
    \overset{Maps(-,-)}{\longrightarrow}
    &

  }


in that this operation has the following properties:


For all X,A∈HX,\,A \,\in\, \mathbf{H} and S∈Grpd ∞S \,\in\, Grpd_\infty we have a natural equivalence
H(X,Maps(LConst(S),A))≃Grpd ∞(S,H(X,A))

In its first argument the operation


sends the terminal object (the point) to the identity:

For the first statement to be proven, consider the following sequence of natural equivalences:

For the second statement, recall that hom-functors preserve limits in that there are natural equivalences of the form

  \,
  \mathbf{H}

and that ∞\infty-toposes have universal colimits, in particular that the product operation is a left adjoint (2) and hence preserves colimits:
(6)(−)×lim⟶S •≃lim⟶((−)×S •).

With this, we get the following sequences of natural equivalences:

Slice-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object, the slice-(∞,1)-category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos – an over-(∞,1)-topos. The projection π !:H /X→H\pi_! : \mathbf{H}_{/X} \to \mathbf{H} part of an essential geometric morphism
π:H /X→π *←π *→π !H.
  \pi : \mathbf{H}_{/X} 
  \stackrel{\overset{\pi_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{\pi^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\pi_*}{\to}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \,.


This is HTT, prop. 6.3.5.1.
The (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} could be called the gros topos of XX. A geometric morphism K→H\mathbf{K} \to \mathbf{H} that factors as K→≃H /X→πH\mathbf{K} \xrightarrow{\simeq} \mathbf{H}_{/X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} \mathbf{H} is called an etale geometric morphism.
Syntax in univalent homotopy type theory
(∞,1)(\infty,1)-Toposes provide categorical semantics for homotopy type theory with a univalent Tarskian type of types (which inteprets as the object classifier).
For more on this see at


model of type theory in an (infinity,1)-topos


relation between type theory and category theory – Univalent homotopy type theory and infinity-toposes


A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}
  \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
A formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with a cohesive structure that subsumes that of smooth ∞-groupoids as well as of infinitesimal ∞\infty-groupoids – ∞-Lie algebroids, hence equipped with “differential cohesion”.
In the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids the canonical fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos Π(X)\mathbf{\Pi}(X) factors through a version relative to Smooth∞Grpd: the infinitesimal path ∞-functor Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X). In traditional terms this is the object modeled by the tangent Lie algebroid and the de Rham space of XX. The quasicoherent ∞-stacks on Π inf(X)\mathbf{\Pi}_{inf}(X) are D-modules on XX.
We consider (∞,1)-sheaves over a “twisted semidirect product” site or (∞,1)-site of


Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them as for smooth ∞-groupoids,


and a category or (∞,1)-category of infinitesimally thickened points.


First in

1-localic definition

we consider the 1-site, then in

∞-localic definition

we consider the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site.
1-localic definition

Definition
Let T:=T :=  CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the syntactic category of the Lawvere theory of smooth algebras: the category of Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n and smooth functions between them.
Write
SmoothAlg:=TAlg
  SmoothAlg := T Alg


for its category of T-algebras – the smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings).
Let
InfPoint↪SmoothAlg op
  InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}


be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points: this smooth algebras whose underlying abelian group is a vector space of the form ℝ⊕V\mathbb{R} \oplus V with VV a finite-dimensional real vector space and nilpotent in the algebra structure.


Definition
Let
FormalCartSp↪SmoothLoc
  FormalCartSp \hookrightarrow SmoothLoc


be the full subcategory of the category of smooth loci on the objects of the form
U=ℝ n×D
  U = \mathbb{R}^n \times D


that are products of a Cartesian space ℝ n∈\mathbb{R}^n \in CartSp for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and an infinitesimally thickened point D∈InfPointD \in InfPoint. (See at FormalCartSp.)
Equip this category with the coverage where a family of morphisms is covering precisely if it is of the form {U i×D→(f i,Id D)U×D}\{U_i \times D \stackrel{(f_i, Id_D)}{\to} U \times D\} for {f i:U i→U}\{f_i : U_i \to U\} a covering in CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} (a good open cover).

This appears as ([Kock 86, (5.1)]).

Note
The sheaf topos over FormalCartSp is (equivalent to) the topos known as the Cahiers topos, a smooth topos that constitutes a well adapted model for synthetic differential geometry. See at Cahiers topos for further references.


Definition
We say the (∞,1)-topos of formal smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves
FormalSmooth∞Grpd:=Sh (∞,1)(FormalCartSp)
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FormalCartSp)


on FormalCartSpFormalCartSp.

∞\infty-localic
We now generalize the 1-category InfPointInfPoint of infinitesimally thickened points to the (∞,1)-category InfPoint ∞InfPoint_\infty of “derived infinitesimally thickened points”, the formal dual of “small commutative ∞\infty-algebras” from (Hinich, Lurie).
(…)

Proposition
FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
Because FormalCartSp is an ∞-cohesive site. See there for details.


Definition
Write FormalSmoothMfd↪SmoothAlg opFormalSmoothMfd \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} for the full subcategory of smooth loci on the formal smooth manifolds: those modeled on FormalCartSp equipped with the evident coverage.


Observation
FormalCartSpFormalCartSp is a dense sub-site of FormalSmoothMfdFormalSmoothMfd.


Proposition
There is an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
FormalSmooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(FSmoothMfd)
  FormalSmooth\infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(FSmoothMfd)


with the hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos over FSmoothMfdFSmoothMfd.


Proof
With the above observation this is directly analogous to the corresponding proof at ETop∞Grpd.


Definition
Write i:CartSp smooth↪FormalCartSpi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow FormalCartSp for the canonical embedding.


Proposition
The functor i *i^* given by restriction along ii exhibits FormalSmooth∞GrpdFormalSmooth\infty Grpd as an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of the (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids in that we have a quadruple of adjoint (∞,1)-functors
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd←i !→i *←i *↪i !FormalSmooth∞Grpd,
 ( i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^! )
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
  \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\hookrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{i_*}{\to}}{\stackrel{i^!}{\leftarrow}}}}
  FormalSmooth \infty Grpd
  \,,


such that i !i_! is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor.


Proof
Since i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp formalsmoothi : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{formalsmooth} is an infinitesimally ∞-cohesive site this follows with a proposition discussed at cohesive (infinity,1)-topos – infinitesimal cohesion.

The notion of smooth super ∞\infty-groupoid or smooth super geometric homotopy type is the combination of of super ∞-groupoid and smooth ∞-groupoid. The cohesive (∞,1)-topos of smooth super-∞\infty-groupoids is a context that realizes higher supergeometry.
Smooth super ∞\infty-groupoids include supermanifolds, super Lie groups and their deloopings etc. Under Lie differentiation these map to super L-∞ algebras.
We consider one of at least two possible definitions, that differ (only) slightly in some fine technical detail. The other is at super smooth infinity-groupoid.
We take a smooth super ∞\infty-groupoid to be a smooth ∞-groupoid but not over the base topos ∞Grpd of bare ∞-groupoids, but over the base topos Super∞Grpd of super ∞-groupoids.

Definition
Write sCartSpsCartSp for the full subcategory of that of supermanifolds on the super Cartesian spaces {ℝ p|q} p,q∈ℕ\{\mathbb{R}^{p|q}\}_{p,q \in \mathbb{N}}. Regard this as a site by taking the coverage the product coverage of the good open cover coverage of CartSp and the trivial coverage on superpoints.


Remark
So a covering family of ℝ p|q\mathbb{R}^{p|q} is of the form
{U i×ℝ 0|q⟶ℝ p|q} i
  \{
    U_i \times \mathbb{R}^{0|q} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p|q}
  \}_{i}


for
{U i⟶ℝ p} i
  \{
    U_i  \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}
  \}_{i}


a differentiably good open cover of ℝ p\mathbb{R}^{p}.


Definition
Let
SmoothSuper∞Grpd:=Sh (∞,1)(sCartSp,Super∞Grpd)
  SmoothSuper\infty Grpd := Sh_{(\infty,1)}(sCartSp, Super \infty Grpd)


be the (∞,1)-topos of (∞,1)-sheaves over the site sCartSpsCartSp, def. .


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of def.  is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos over ∞Grpd.

This and the stronger statement that it is in fact it is actually cohesive over Super∞Grpd is discussed below, see cor. .
Cohesion over smooth ∞\infty-groupoids and over super ∞\infty-groupoids

Proposition
SmoothSuper∞GrpdSmooth Super \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos over Super∞Grpd.

 \,.



Proof
By definition of the coverage on sCartSpsCartSp in def. , the proof of the cohesion of Smooth∞Grpd = Sh ∞(CartSp)Sh_\infty(CartSp) goes through verbatim for each fixed superpoint and that gives precisely the claim.


Proposition
Super∞Grpd is infinitesimally cohesive over ∞Grpd.

By the discussion at Super∞Grpd.

where the right vertical adjoints exhibit infinitesimal cohesion.

An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
A category consists of a collection of objects together with morphisms between these objects. Thus, naively, we may think of objects as the ‘elements’ of a category.
More generally, in higher category theory the objects of an (n,r)(n,r)-category are the 00-dimensional cells of that structure, the 00-morphisms.
A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}
  \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
An object XX of a category is small if it is κ\kappa-compact for some regular cardinal κ\kappa (and therefore also for all greater regular cardinals).
Here, XX is called κ\kappa-compact if the corepresentable functor hom(X,⋅)hom(X,\cdot) preserves κ\kappa-directed colimits.
Let λ>κ\lambda \gt \kappa be a regular cardinal greater than κ\kappa. Then any λ\lambda-filtered category DD is also κ\kappa-filtered. For being λ\lambda-filtered means that any diagram in DD of size <λ\lt\lambda has a cocone; but any diagram of size <κ\lt\kappa is of course also <λ\lt\lambda. Thus, any λ\lambda-filtered colimit is also a κ\kappa-filtered colimit, so any functor which preserves κ\kappa-filtered colimits must in particular preserve λ\lambda-filtered colimits. It follows that any κ\kappa-compact object is also λ\lambda-compact.
A crucial ingredient in a topos is a subobject classifier. From the point of view of homotopy theory, that this has to do with subobjects turns out to be a coincidence of low dimensions: subobjects are (-1)-truncated morphisms.
As discussed also at stuff, structure, property, the classifying objects in higher topos theory classify more general morphisms.
When one passes all the way to ∞-toposes, there should be objects that classify all morphisms, subject to some bound on size. This is made precise in the context of (∞,1)-topos theory.
One way to characterize an (∞,1)-topos is as


a presentable (∞,1)-category


with universal colimits


such that for all sufficiently large regular cardinals κ\kappa there is a classifying object for the class of all κ\kappa-compact morphisms in XX.


This statement is originally due to Charles Rezk. It is reproduced as (Lurie HTT, theorem 6.1.6.8).
In terms of homotopy type theory these object classifiers are types of types. See there for more details and see at relation between category theory and type theory.

Remark
An object classifier is a (small) self-reflection of the (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-topos inside itself (type of types, internal universe). It possesses an internal (∞,1)-topos structure. See also (WdL, book 2, section 1).



free cocompletion


Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
An object XX of a category is small if it is κ\kappa-compact for some regular cardinal κ\kappa (and therefore also for all greater regular cardinals).
Here, XX is called κ\kappa-compact if the corepresentable functor hom(X,⋅)hom(X,\cdot) preserves κ\kappa-directed colimits.
Let λ>κ\lambda \gt \kappa be a regular cardinal greater than κ\kappa. Then any λ\lambda-filtered category DD is also κ\kappa-filtered. For being λ\lambda-filtered means that any diagram in DD of size <λ\lt\lambda has a cocone; but any diagram of size <κ\lt\kappa is of course also <λ\lt\lambda. Thus, any λ\lambda-filtered colimit is also a κ\kappa-filtered colimit, so any functor which preserves κ\kappa-filtered colimits must in particular preserve λ\lambda-filtered colimits. It follows that any κ\kappa-compact object is also λ\lambda-compact.
An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} any object, the over-(∞,1)-category H/X\mathbf{H}/X is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos: the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos (the fundamental theorem of 


∞

\infty

-topos theory).
If we think of H\mathbf{H} as a big topos, then for X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} we may think of H/X∈\mathbf{H}/X \in  (∞,1)-topos as the little topos-incarnation of XX. The objects of H/X\mathbf{H}/X we may think of as (∞,1)-sheaves on XX.
This correspondence between objects of XX and their little-topos incarnation is entirly natural: H\mathbf{H} is equivalently recovered as the (∞,1)-category whose objects are over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes H/X\mathbf{H}/X and whose morphisms are (∞,1)-geometric morphisms over H\mathbf{H}.

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object also the over-(∞,1)-category H/X\mathbf{H}/X is an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos. This is the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos of H\mathbf{H} over XX.

This is HTT, prop 6.3.5.1 (1).
Base change to the point

Proposition
There is a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism
H/X⟶X *⟵X *⟶X !H
  \mathbf{H}/X 
    \stackrel{\overset{X_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{X^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{X_*}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}


where the extra left adjoint X !X_! is the obvious projection X !:(Y→X)↦XX_! : (Y \to X) \mapsto X, and X *X_* is given by forming the (∞,1)-product with XX.

This is called an etale geometric morphism. See there for more details.

Proof
The fact that (X !⊣X *)(X_! \dashv X^*) follows from the universal property of the products. The fact that X *X^* preserves (∞,1)-colimits and hence has a further right adjoint X *X_* by the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem follows from that fact that H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits.


Corollary
If H\mathbf{H} is a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos then for all X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} also the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H/X\mathbf{H}/X is locally ∞\infty-connected.


Proof

  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{LConst_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd


is itself a geometric morphism. Since ∞Grpd is the terminal object in (∞,1)Topos this must be the global section geometric morphism for H/X\mathbf{H}/X. Since it has the extra left adjoint Π∘X !\Pi \circ X_! it is locally ∞\infty-connected.


Proposition
Let ((∞,1)Topos/H) et⊂(∞,1)Topos/H((\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H})_{et} \subset (\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H} be the full sub-(∞,1)-category on the etale geometric morphisms H/X→H\mathbf{H}/X \to \mathbf{H}. Then there is an equivalence
((∞,1)Topos/H) et≃H
  ((\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H})_{et}
  \simeq

As (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves on the big (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site of an object
We spell out how H/X\mathbf{H}/X is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over the big site of XX.
The following may be seen as the presheaf version of the fundamental theorem of

-topos theory.

Proposition
(forming overcategories commutes with passing to presheaves)
Let CC be a small (∞,1)-category and X:K⟶CX \colon K \longrightarrow C a diagram. Write C /XC_{/X} and PSh(C) /XPSh(C)_{/X} for the corresponding over (∞,1)-categories, where – notationally implicitly – we use the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding C↪PSh(C)C \hookrightarrow PSh(C).
Then we have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
PSh(C /X)⟶≃PSh(C) /X.
  PSh\big(
    C_{/X}
  \big) 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  PSh(C)_{/X}
  \,.


This appears as HTT, 5.1.6.12. For more on this see (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves.

Remark
Here we may think of C/XC/X as the big site of the object c∈PSh(C)c \in PSh(C), hence of PSh(C/X)PSh(C/X) as presheaves on XX.


Proposition
Let CC be equipped with a subcanonical coverage, let X∈CX \in C and regard C/XC/X as an (∞,1)-site with the big site-coverage. Then we have
Sh(C/X)≃Sh(C)/X.
  Sh(C/X) \simeq Sh(C)/X
  \,.



Proof
By the discussion of adjoint (∞,1)-functors on over-(∞,1)-categories adjoint (∞,1)-functors we have that the adjunction

(where we are using that FiX≃XF  i X \simeq X by the assumption that the coverage is subcanonical, so that the representable XX is a (∞,1)-sheaf), such that i/Xi/X is still a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor (where we are using that the unit X→FiXX \to F i X is an equivalence, since XX is a sheaf).
Since moreover the (∞,1)-limits in Sh(C)/XSh(C)/X are computed as limits in Sh(C)Sh(C) over diagrams with a bottom element adjoined (as discussed at limits in over-(∞,1)-categories) it follows that with FF preserving all finite limits, so does F/XF/X.
In summary we have that (F/X⊣i/X)(F/X \dashv i/X) is a reflective sub-(∞,1)-category of PSh(C/X)PSh(C/X) hence is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the category C/XC/X for some (∞,1)-site-structure. But since F/XF/X inverts precisely those morphisms that are inverted by FF under the projection PSh(C)/X→PSh(C)PSh(C)/X \to PSh(C), it follows that this is the big site structure on C/XC/X (this is the defining property of the big site).

Specifically for the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞Grpd we also have the following characterization.

Proposition
For H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞Grpd we have that for X∈∞GrpX \in \infty Grp any ∞-groupoid the corresponding over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is equivalent to the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves on XX:
∞Grpd/X≃PSh(X)≃[X,∞Grpd].
  \infty Grpd/X \simeq PSh(X) \simeq [X, \infty Grpd]
  \,.



Proof
This is a special case of the (∞,1)-Grothendieck construction. See the section (∞,0)-fibrations over ∞-groupoids.

The following proposition asserts that the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over an nn-truncated object indeed behaves like a generalized n-groupoid


Proposition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and 𝒳\mathcal{X} an n-localic (∞,1)-topos, then the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos 𝒳/U\mathcal{X}/U is nn-localic precisely if the object UU is nn-truncated.


This is (StrSp, lemma 2.3.16).
Object classifier
If Obj κ∈HObj_\kappa \in \mathbf{H} is an object classifier for κ\kappa-small objects, then the projection Obj Κ×X→XObj_\Kappa \times X \to X regarded as an object in the slice is a κ\kappa-small object classifier in H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}.
In homotopy type theory
If a homotopy type theory is the internal language of H\mathbf{H}, then then theory in context x:X⊢⋯x : X \vdash \cdots is the internal language of H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}.
In the most general sense, a bundle over an object BB in a category 𝒞\mathcal{C} is simply an object EE of 𝒞\mathcal{C} equipped with a morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} from EE to BB:
E ↓ p B \array { E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} \\ B } 
One often refers to such a bundle simply as EE, even though BB is really part of the data.
For x∈Bx \in B a generalized element of BB, the fiber E xE_x of the bundle over xx is the pullback x *Ex^* E.
Given two bundles E 1E_1 and E 2E_2 over BB, then a morphism of bundles over BB is a morphism E 1→E 2E_1 \to E_2 which makes this diagram commute:
E 1  ⟶  E 2   p 1↘  ↙ p 2   B.
  \array{
    E_1 && \longrightarrow && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    && B 
  }
  \,.


This way bundles over BB form a category, also called the slice category 𝒞 /B\mathcal{C}_{/B} of 𝒞\mathcal{C} over BB.
The dependent sum is a universal construction in category theory. It generalizes the Cartesian product to the situation where one factor may depend on the other. It is the left adjoint to the base change functor between slice categories.
The dual notion is that of dependent product.
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a category and f:A→If \colon A \to I a morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} such that pullbacks along ff exist in 𝒞\mathcal{C}. These then constitute a base change functor
f *:𝒞 /I→𝒞 /A
  f^* \colon \mathcal{C}_{/I} \to \mathcal{C}_{/A}


between the corresponding slice categories.

Definition
The dependent sum or dependent coproduct along the morphism ff is the left adjoint ∑ f:𝒞 /A→𝒞 /I\sum_f \colon \mathcal{C}_{/A} \to \mathcal{C}_{/I} of the base change functor
(∑ f⊣f *):𝒞 /A←f *→∑ f𝒞 /I.
  (\sum_f \dashv f^* )
  \colon
  \mathcal{C}_{/A}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_f}{\to}}{\underset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/I}
  \qquad.


This is directly seen to be equivalent to the following.

Definition
The dependent sum along f:A→If \colon A \to I is the functor
∑ f≔f∘(−):𝒞 /A→𝒞 /I
  \sum_f \coloneqq f\circ (-) \colon \mathcal{C}_{/A} \to \mathcal{C}_{/I}


given by composition with ff.

Relation to the product
Assume that the category 𝒞\mathcal{C} has a terminal object *∈𝒞* \in \mathcal{C}. Let X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} be any object and assume that the terminal morphism f:X→*f \colon X \to * admits all pullbacks along it.
Notice that a pullback of some A→*A \to * along X→*X \to * is simply the product X×AX \times A, equipped with its projection morphism X×A→XX \times A \to X. We may regard X×A→XX \times A \to X as the image of the base change functor f *:𝒞 /*→𝒞 /Xf^* \colon \mathcal{C}_{/*} \to \mathcal{C}_{/X}, but this is not quite just the product in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, which instead corresponds to the terminal morphisms X×A→*X \times A \to *. But we have:

Proposition
The product X×A∈𝒞X \times A \in \mathcal{C} is, if it exists, equivalently the dependent sum of the base change of A→*A \to * along X→*X \to *:
∑ XX *A≃X×A∈𝒞.
  \sum_{X} X^* A \simeq X \times A \in \mathcal{C}
  \quad .


Here we write “XX” also for the morphism X→*X \to *.
Relation to type theory
Under the relation between category theory and type theory the dependent sum is the categorical semantics of dependent sum types .
Notice that under the identification of propositions as types, dependent sum types (or rather their bracket types) correspond to existential quantification ∃x:X,Px\exists x\colon X, P x.
The following table shows how the natural deduction rules for dependent sum types correspond to their categorical semantics given by the dependent sum universal construction.

The inference rules for dependent pair types (aka “dependent sum types” or “Σ\Sigma-types”):



Relation to some limits

Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category with finite limits and X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object, then dependent sum
∑X:𝒞 /X⟶𝒞
  \underset{X}{\sum}: \mathcal{C}_{/X} \longrightarrow \mathcal{C}


preserves and reflects fiber products.


Proof
By this proposition limits over a cospan diagram in the slice category are computed as limits over the cocone diagram under the cospan in the base category. By this proposition this inclusion is a final functor, hence preserves limits. Since the dependent sum of the diagram is the restriction along this final functor, the result follows.


Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category with finite limits and X∈𝒞X\in \mathcal{C} any object, the naturality square of the unit of the (∑X⊣X *)(\underset{X}{\sum} \dashv X^\ast)-adjunction on any morphism (f:A→B)(f \colon A \to B) in 𝒞 /X\mathcal{C}_{/X}
A ⟶ X *∑XA ↓ f  ↓ X *∑Xf B ⟶ X *∑XB
  \array{
    A  &\longrightarrow& X^\ast \underset{X}{\sum} A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{X^\ast \underset{X}{\sum} f}}
    \\
    B &\longrightarrow& X^\ast \underset{X}{\sum} B
  }


is a pullback.


Proof
By prop.  it suffices to see that the diagram is a pullback in 𝒞\mathcal{C} under ∑X\underset{X}{\sum}, where, by Frobenius reciprocity, it becomes
∑XA ⟶(A,id) X×∑XA ↓ ∑Xf  ↓ (id,∑Xf) ∑XB ⟶(B,id) X×∑XB.
  \array{
    \underset{X}{\sum} A  &\stackrel{(A,id)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times \underset{X}{\sum} A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\underset{X}{\sum}f}}  && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id, \underset{X}{\sum} f)}}
    \\
    \underset{X}{\sum} B &\stackrel{(B,id)}{\longrightarrow}& X \times \underset{X}{\sum} B
  }
  \qquad .



Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category with finite limits and X∈𝒞X\in \mathcal{C} any object, the naturality square of the counit of the (∑X⊣X *)(\underset{X}{\sum} \dashv X^\ast)-adjunction on any morphism (f:A→B)(f \colon A \to B) in 𝒞\mathcal{C}
∑XX *A ⟶ A ↓ ∑XX *f  ↓ f ∑XX *B ⟶ B
  \array{
    \underset{X}{\sum} X^\ast A &\longrightarrow& A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\underset{X}{\sum}X^\ast f}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    \underset{X}{\sum} X^\ast B &\longrightarrow& B
  }


is a pullback.


Proof
By Frobenius reciprocity the diagram is equivalent to
X×A ⟶ A ↓ (id,f)  ↓ f X×B ⟶ B.
  \array{
    X\times A & \longrightarrow& A
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(id,f)}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    X \times B &\longrightarrow& B
  }
  \qquad.


The left part of a pair of adjoint functors is one of two best approximations to a weak inverse of the other functor of the pair. (The other best approximation is the functor’s right adjoint, if it exists.) Note that a weak inverse itself, if it exists, must be a left adjoint, forming an adjoint equivalence.
A left adjoint to a forgetful functor is called a free functor. Many left adjoints can be constructed as quotients of free functors.
The concept generalises immediately to enriched categories and in 2-categories.


left adjoints preserve colimits


left adjoints preserve epimorphisms.


In homotopy type theory
Note: the HoTT book calls a internal category in HoTT a “precategory” and a univalent category a “category”, but here we shall refer to the standard terminology of “category” and “univalent category” respectively.


Lemma
(Lemma 9.3.2 in the HoTT book)  If AA is an univalent category and BB is a category then the type “FF is a left adjoint” is a mere proposition.




Proof
Suppose we are given (G,η,ϵ)(G, \eta, \epsilon) with the triangle identities and also (G′,η′,ϵ′)(G', \eta', \epsilon'). Define γ:G→G′\gamma: G \to G' to be (G′ϵ)(ηG′)(G' \epsilon )(\eta G'). Then
δγ =(Gϵ′)(ηG′)(G′ϵ)(η′G)  =(Gϵ′)(GFG′ϵ ))ηG′FG)(η′G)  =(Gϵ′)(Gϵ′FG)(GFη′G)(ηG)  =(Gϵ)(ηG)  =1 G \begin{aligned}
  \delta \gamma &= (G \epsilon')(\eta G')(G' \epsilon) (\eta' G)\\
  &= (G \epsilon')(G F G' \epsilon_))\eta G' F G)(\eta' G)\\
  &= (G \epsilon ')(G \epsilon' F G)(G F \eta' G)(\eta G)\\
  &= (G \epsilon)(\eta G)\\
  &= 1_G
\end{aligned} 

using Lemma 9.2.8 (see natural transformation) and the triangle identities. Similarly, we show γδ=1 G′\gamma \delta=1_{G'}, so γ\gamma is a natural isomorphism G≅G′G \cong G'. By Theorem 9.2.5 (see functor category), we have an identity G=G′G=G'.
Now we need to know that when η\eta and ϵ\epsilon are transported? along this identity, they become equal to η′\eta' and ϵ′\epsilon '. By Lemma 9.1.9,

Lemma 9.1.9 needs to be included. For now as transports are not yet written up I didn’t bother including a reference to the page category. -Ali

this transport is given by composing with γ\gamma or δ\delta as appropriate. For η\eta, this yields
(G′ϵF)(η′GF)η=(G′ϵF)(G′Fη)η′=η′(G' \epsilon F)(\eta' G F)\eta = (G' \epsilon F)(G' F \eta)\eta'=\eta'
using Lemma 9.2.8 (see natural transformation) and the traingle identity. The case of ϵ\epsilon is similar. FInally, the triangle identities transport correctly automatically, since hom-sets are sets.


Examples

The left adjoint of the nerve functor N:Grpd→Set Δ opN: \mathsf{Grpd} \to \mathsf{Set}^{\Delta^{op}} from the category of groupoids to the category of simplicial sets is the fundamental groupoid functor.

In the strict sense of the word, a cartesian product is a product in Set, the category of sets. Hence for S 1S_1 and S 2S_2 two sets, their cartesian product is the set denoted S 1×S 2S_1\times S_2 whose elements are ordered pairs of elements in S 1S_1 and S 2S_2, respectively.
The abstract concept of such products generalizes from Set to any other category (as a special case of a category-theoretic limit), only that in general products of any given objects may or may not actually exist in that category.
(If they all exist, then one speaks of a cartesian monoidal category. Especially if the category is also a monoidal category with respect to some other tensor product, then one says “Cartesian product” to distinguish the two. For instance one speaks of the cartesian product on Cat and on 2Cat in contrast to the Gray tensor product.)
A product created by the forgetful functor of a concrete category, especially in algebra, is often called a direct product (for instance a direct product of groups).
Relation to type theory
Under the relation between category theory and type theory products in a category correspond to product types in type theory.

Foundational status
In material set theory, the existence of binary cartesian products follows from the axiom of pairing and the axiom of weak replacement? (which is very weak). In structural set theory, their existence generally must be stated as an axiom: the axiom of products. See ordered pair for more details.
In the most general sense, a bundle over an object BB in a category 𝒞\mathcal{C} is simply an object EE of 𝒞\mathcal{C} equipped with a morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C} from EE to BB:
E ↓ p B \array { E \\ \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}} \\ B } 
One often refers to such a bundle simply as EE, even though BB is really part of the data.
For x∈Bx \in B a generalized element of BB, the fiber E xE_x of the bundle over xx is the pullback x *Ex^* E.
Given two bundles E 1E_1 and E 2E_2 over BB, then a morphism of bundles over BB is a morphism E 1→E 2E_1 \to E_2 which makes this diagram commute:
E 1  ⟶  E 2   p 1↘  ↙ p 2   B.
  \array{
    E_1 && \longrightarrow && E_2
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{p_1}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{p_2}}
    \\
    && B 
  }
  \,.


This way bundles over BB form a category, also called the slice category 𝒞 /B\mathcal{C}_{/B} of 𝒞\mathcal{C} over BB.


free cocompletion


Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category and X,Y∈𝒞X, Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the internal hom [X,Y]∈𝒞[X,Y] \in \mathcal{C} from XX to YY is, if it exists, another object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} which behaves like the “object of morphisms” from XX to YY. In other words it is, if it exists, an internal version of the ordinary hom set 𝒞(X,Y)∈Set\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in Set or more generally hom object 𝒞(X,Y)∈𝒱\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in \mathcal{V} of a locally small category or 𝒱\mathcal{V}-enriched category.
One way to make this precise starts by mimicking a property of the function set [X,Y]={f:X→Y}[X,Y] = \{f : X \to Y\} of functions between two sets XX and YY: this set is characterized by the fact that for any other set SS, the functions S→[X,Y]S \to [X,Y] are in natural bijection with the functions S×X→YS \times X \to Y out of the cartesian product of SS with XX. That is: for each set XX, the functor (−)×X(-) \times X has a right adjoint, given by the construction [X,−][X,-].
One can verbalize this thus: taking the cartesian product with the set XX is left-adjoint to taking the set of all functions with domain XX.
This, then, is, generally, the definition of internal hom in any cartesian monoidal category or in fact in any monoidal category (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes): the right adjoint [X,−][X,-] to the given tensor product functor (−)⊗X(-)\otimes X for all objects XX. It may or may not exist. If it exists, one says that (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is a closed monoidal category. Explicity, the condition is that there is an isomorphism(bijection)
𝒞(A,[X,Z])→≃𝒞(A⊗X,Z)
  \mathcal{C}(A, [X,Z]) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathcal{C}(A \otimes X, Z)


which is natural in all three variables. (The rightward map here is often called currying, especially in a closed monoidal category (and more especially for the λ\lambda-calculus).)
In particular this implies that in a closed monoidal category the external hom is re-obtained from the internal hom as its set of generalized elements out of the tensor unit I∈𝒞I \in \mathcal{C} in that
I→[X,Y]X→Y
  \frac{I \to [X,Y]}{X \to Y}


using that I⊗X≃XI \otimes X \simeq X by definition of the tensor unit.
Here “closed” in “closed monoidal category” is in the sense that forming “hom-sets” does not lead “out of the category”. In fact the internal hom of a cartesian monoidal category is indeed the hom as seen in the internal logic of that category (the function type).
More generally, one can consider objects that satisfy some basic universal properties that an internal hom should satisfy even in the absence of a monoidal structure. If such objects exist one speaks therefore just of a closed category. Every closed category may be seen as a category enriched over itself. Accordingly, an internal hom is after all a special case of a hom-object, for the special case of this enrichment over itself.

Definition
(internal hom)
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric monoidal category. An internal hom in 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a functor
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞→𝒞
  [-,-] : \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}


such that for every object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} we have a pair of adjoint functors
((−)⊗X⊣[X,−]):𝒞→𝒞.
  ((-) \otimes X \dashv [X, -]) : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.


If this exists, (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is called a closed monoidal category.


Remark
If the monoidal category 𝒞\mathcal{C} in Def.  is not symmetric, there is instead a concept of left- and right-internal hom.

Evaluation map
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ).

Definition
For X,Y∈𝒞X,Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the evaluation map
eval X,Y:[X,Y]⊗X→Y
  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \otimes X \to Y


is the ((−)⊗X⊣[X,−])((-)\otimes X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the identity id [X,Y]:[X,Y]→[X,Y]id_{[X,Y]} : [X,Y] \to [X,Y].


Remark
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is specifically a locally cartesian closed category, then in terms of the type theory internal language of 𝒞\mathcal{C} the evaluation map is the categorical semantics of the dependent type which in type theory syntax is
f:X→Y,x:X⊢f(x):Y,
  f \colon X \to Y,\; x \colon X 
    \;\vdash\; 
   f(x) \colon Y
  \,,


with function application on the right.

Composition map
Let (𝒞,×)(\mathcal{C}, \times) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. )

Definition
For X,Y,Z∈𝒞X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{C} three objects, the composition morphism
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z]
  \times
  [X, Y]
  \to 
  [X, Z]


is the ((−)×X⊣[X,−])((-)\times X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the following composite of two evaluation maps, def. :
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→(id [Y,Z],eval X,Y)[Y,Z]×Y→eval Y,ZZ.
  [Y, Z] \times [X , Y] \times X 
    \stackrel{(id_{[Y,Z]}, eval_{X,Y})}{\to}
  [Y,Z] \times Y
    \stackrel{eval_{Y,Z}}{\to}
  Z
  \,.


Basic properties
The internal homs in a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ) happen to share all the key abstract properties of ordinary (“external”) hom-functors, even though this is not completely manifest from Def. :

Proposition
(internal hom bifunctor)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric monoidal category such that for each object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} the functor X⊗(−)X \otimes (-) has a right adjoint [X,−][X,-]. Then this is already equivalent to Def. , in that there is a unique functor out of the product categoryof 𝒞\mathcal{C} with its opposite category
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞⟶𝒞
  [-,-]
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}


such that for each X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} it coincides with the internal hom [X,−][X,-] as a functor in the second variable, and such that there is a natural isomorphism
Hom(X,[Y,Z])≃Hom(X⊗Y,Z)
  Hom(X, [Y,Z])
  \;\simeq\;
  Hom(X \otimes Y, Z)


which is natural not only in XX and ZZ, but also in YY.


Proof
We have a natural isomorphism for each fixed YY, and hence in particular for fixed YY and fixed ZZ. With this the statement follows directly by this prop. at adjoint functor.

In fact the 3-variable adjunction from Prop.  even holds internally:

Proposition
(internal tensor/hom-adjunction)
In a closed monoidal category (def. ) there are natural isomorphisms
[X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]]
  [X \otimes Y, Z]
   \;\simeq\;
  [X, [Y,Z]]


whose image under Hom 𝒞(1,−)Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,-) are the defining natural bijections of Prop. .


Proof
Let A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C} be any object. By applying the natural bijections from Prop. , there are composite natural bijections
Hom 𝒞(A,[X⊗Y,Z]) ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗(X⊗Y),Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞((A⊗X)⊗Y,Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗X,[Y,Z])  ≃Hom 𝒞(A,[X,[Y,Z]])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A , [X \otimes Y, Z])
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes (X \otimes Y), Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}((A \otimes X)\otimes Y, Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes X, [Y,Z])
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, [X, [Y,Z]])
  \end{aligned}


Since this holds for all AA, the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding says that there is an isomorphism [X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]][ X\otimes Y, Z ] \simeq [X, [Y,Z]]. Moreover, by taking A=1A = 1 in the above and using the left unitor isomorphisms A⊗(X⊗Y)≃X⊗YA \otimes (X \otimes Y) \simeq X \otimes Y and A⊗X≃XA\otimes X \simeq X we get a commuting diagram
Hom 𝒞(1,[X⊗Y,Z]) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(1,[X,[Y,Z]])  ≃↓  ↓ ≃ Hom 𝒞(X⊗Y,Z) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(X,[Y,Z]).
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1, [X\otimes Y, Z ])

  \,.


Also the key respect of hom-functors for limits is inherited by internal hom-functors:

Proposition
(internal hom-functor preserves limits)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric closed monoidal category with internal hom-bifunctor [−,−][-,-] (Prop. ). Then this bifunctor preserves limits in the second variable, and sends colimits in the first variable to limits:
[X,lim⟵j∈𝒥Y(j)]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[X,Y(j)]
  [X, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} Y(j)]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [X, Y(j)]


and
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X]
  [\underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j),X]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j),X]  



Proof
For X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} any object, [X,−][X,-] is a right adjoint by definition, and hence preserves limits by adjoints preserve (co-)limits.
For the other case, let Y:ℒ→𝒞Y \;\colon\; \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{C} be a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, and let C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C} be any object. Then there are isomorphisms
Hom 𝒞(C,[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]) ≃Hom 𝒞(C⊗lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X)  ≃Hom 𝒞(lim⟶j∈𝒥(C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞((C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞(C,[Y(j),X])  ≃Hom 𝒞(C,lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C, [ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X ] )
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C \otimes \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X )
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} (C \otimes Y(j)), X )   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( (C \otimes Y(j)), X )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, [Y(j), X] )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X] )    
  \end{aligned}


which are natural in C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C}, where we used that the ordinary hom-functor respects (co)limits as shown (see at hom-functor preserves limits), and that the left adjoint C⊗(−)C \otimes (-) preserves colimits (see at adjoints preserve (co-)limits).
Hence by the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding, there is an isomorphism
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]⟶≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X].
  \left[ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X \right]  
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X]

Relation to function types

Induced monad (state monad)
For each object SS the (internal hom ⊣\dashv tensor product)-adjunction induces a monad [S,S⊗(−)][S, S \otimes (-)]. In computer science this monad (in computer science) is called the state monad.
Stable splitting
In topology the stabilization/suspension spectrum Σ ∞Maps(X,A)\Sigma^\infty  Maps(X,A) of mapping spaces Maps(X,A)Maps(X,A) between suitable CW-complexes X,AX, A happens to decompose as a direct sum of spectra in a useful way, related to the expression of the Goodwillie derivatives of the functor Maps(X,−)Maps(X,-).
For more on this see at stable splitting of mapping spaces.
In sets
In the category Set of sets, regarded as a cartesian monoidal category, the internal hom is given by function sets. This exists, by the discussion there, as soon as the foundational axioms are strong enough, for instance as soon as there are power objects, which is the special case of a function set into the 2-element set.
In simplicial sets
In the category sSet of simplicial sets, the internal hom between two simplicial sets X,YX,Y is given by the formula
[X,Y] n=Hom sSet(X×Δ[n],Y),
  [X,Y]_n = Hom_{sSet}(X\times \Delta[n],Y)
  \,,


where Δ[n]\Delta[n] is the simplicial n-simplex. This [X,Y]∈sSet[X,Y] \in sSet is also called the function complex between XX and YY.
Since sSet≃PSh(Δ)sSet \simeq PSh(\Delta) is the category of presheaves over the simplex category, this is a special case of internal homs in sheaf toposes, discussed below.
In a sheaf topos or (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaf (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos
Let CC be a site. Let H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) be the sheaf topos over CC or in fact the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos. We discuss the internal hom of this regard as a cartesian monoidal category/cartesian monoidal (∞,1)-category.

Proposition
The sheaf topos H\mathbf{H} is a cartesian closed category / cartesian closed (∞,1)-category. In fact it is a locally cartesian closed category / locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.

Hence the internal hom exist.

Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H} two objects, the internal hom-object
[X,Y]∈H
  [X,Y] \in \mathbf{H}


is the sheaf/(∞,1)-sheaf given by the assignment
[X,Y]:U↦H(U×X,Y),
  [X,Y] : U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,,


for all objects U∈CU \in C which on the right we regard under the Yoneda embedding/∞-Yoneda embedding U∈C↪YonedaHU \in C \stackrel{Yoneda}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}.
Here


U×X∈HU \times X \in \mathbf{H} is the cartesian product of UU with XX


H(−,−)\mathbf{H}(-,-) is the hom set-functor / hom space-(∞,1)-functor of H\mathbf{H}.



See also at closed monoidal structure on presheaves.

Proof
By the Yoneda lemma/(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma we have natural equivalences
[X,Y](U)≃H(U,[X,Y])
  [X,Y](U) \simeq \mathbf{H}(U , [X,Y])


and by the defining ((−)×X⊢[X,−])((-)\times X \vdash [X,-])adjunction this is naturally equivalent to
⋯≃H(U×X,Y).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,.



Remark
In the (homotopy-)type theory syntax of the internal language of H\mathbf{H} the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X, Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the categorical semantics of the function type
⊢(X→Y):Type.
  \vdash (X \to Y) : Type
  \,.



Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H}, the evaluation map, def. ,
eval X,Y:[X,Y]×X→Y
  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \times X \to Y


is the morphism of sheaves which over each U∈CU \in C sends a morphism of sheaves θ:H(−,U)×X(−)→Y(−)\theta : \mathbf{H}(-,U) \times X(-) \to Y(-) (which is the first component by prop. ) and an x∈H(U,X)x \in \mathbf{H}(U,X) to
eval X,Y(U):(θ,x)↦θ U(id U,x)∈Y(U).
  eval_{X,Y}(U) : (\theta, x) \mapsto \theta_U(id_U, x) \in Y(U)
  \,.


See (MacLane-Moerdijk, p. 46).

Proposition
For X,Y,Z∈HX, Y, Z \in \mathbf{H} three objects of H\mathbf{H}, the canonical composition morphism, def. ,
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z] \times [X, Y] \to [X, Z]


is given by the morphism of presheaves/(∞,1)-presheaves whose component over U∈CU \in C is the morphism of sets/∞-groupoids
∘ X,Y,Z(U):H(U×X,Y)×H(U×Y,Z)→H(U×X,Z)
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \times
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Z)


which sends a pair (f:U×X→Y,g:U×Y→Z)(f : U \times X \to Y, g : U \times Y \to Z) to the composite
∘ X,Y,Z(U)(f,g)=U×X→(Δ U,id X)U×U×X→(id U,f)U×Y→gZ,
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)(f,g)
  = 
  U \times X 
  \stackrel{(\Delta_U, id_X)}{\to}
  U \times U \times X
  \stackrel{(id_U, f)}{\to}
  U \times Y 
  \stackrel{g}{\to}
  Z
  \,,


where Δ U:U→U×U\Delta_U : U \to U \times U is the diagonal morphism on UU.


Proof
By definition  the morphism is the adjunct of the double evaluation map
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→Z.
  [Y,Z] \times [X,Y] \times X \to Z
  \,.


Since the cartesian product of two sheaves A,B∈HA, B \in \mathbf{H} is computed objectwise
A×B:U↦A(U)×B(U)
  A \times B : U \mapsto A(U) \times B(U)


it follows that over each U∈CU \in C this double evaluation map is the morphism of sets/∞\infty-groupoids
[Y,Z](U)×[X,Y](U)×X(U)→Z(U)
  [Y,Z](U) \times [X,Y](U) \times X(U) \to Z(U)


hence by prop. 
H(U×Y,Z)×H(U×X,Y)×H(U,X)→H(U,Z),
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z) \times \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y) \times 
  \mathbf{H}(U,X) \to \mathbf{H}(U,Z)
  \,,


where now by prop.  this is the external evaluation.


Remark
Intuitively this says that the composite of a UU-parameterized family of maps {f(u):X→Y|u∈U}\{f(u) :  X \to Y| u \in U\} with a UU-parameterized family of maps g(u):Y→Z|u∈U{g(u) : Y \to Z| u \in U} is the UU-family given by the parameter-wise composite {g(u)∘f(u)|u∈U}\{g(u)\circ f(u) | u \in U\}.


Example
The internal automorphism group/automorphism ∞-group of an object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} is the subobject
Aut(X)↪[X,X]
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow [X,X]


of the internal hom which is maximal subject to the property that the composition of prop.  becomes invertible.
The (homotopy-)type theory syntax for this is given by the type of equivalences in homotopy type theory
⊢(X→≃X):Type.
  \vdash (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X) : Type
  \,.


In slice categories
Let H\mathbf{H} be a locally cartesian closed category. This means that for each object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the slice category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is a cartesian closed category. The product in the slice is given by the fiber product over XX computed in H\mathbf{H}. Fairly detailed discussion of constructions of the internal hom in such slices H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is at locally cartesian closed category – cartesian closure in terms of base change and dependent product.
We record some further properties

Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a locally cartesian closed category and f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, the inverse image f *f^* of the corresponding base change adjunction
𝒞 /X→∏ f←f *→∑ f𝒞 /Y
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_f}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_f}{\to}}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}


is a cartesian closed functor.

This is discussed in more detail at cartesian closed functor – Examples.
So for A,B∈𝒞 /YA,B \in \mathcal{C}_{/Y} we have isomorphisms
f *[A,B]→≃[f *A,f *B]
  f^* \left[A,B\right] \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \left[f^* A , f^* B\right]


between the image of the internal hom under f *f^* and the internal hom of the images of AA and BB separately.

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a locally cartesian closed category, f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism, and A,B∈H /XA, B \in \mathbf{H}_{/X} two objects in the slice over XX, there is a natural morphism (not in general an isomorphism)
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f \left[A,B \right] \to \left[ \sum_f A, \sum_f B\right]
  \,.


Here are two ways to get this morphism:

Proof/Construction 1
For any object U∈H /YU \in \mathbf{H}_{/Y} we have a canonical morphism of hom sets
H /Y(U,∏ f[A,B]) ≃H /X(f *U,[A,B])  ≃H /X(f *U×A,B)  →H /Y(∑ f(f *U×A),∑ fB)  ≃Frob.Rec.H /Y(U×∑ fA,∑ fB)  ≃H /Y(U,[∑ fA,∑ fB])
  \begin{aligned}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U, \prod_f [A,B] )
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}( f^* U, [A,B] )
     \\
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}(f^* U \times A, B)
     \\
     & \stackrel{}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( \sum_f( f^* U \times A ), \sum_f B )
    \\
     & \stackrel{Frob.Rec.}{\simeq}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U \times \sum_f A , \sum_f B )
     \\
     & \simeq
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}(U, [\sum_f A , \sum_f B])
  \end{aligned}


where the first and the last steps use adjunction properties, where the morphism in the middle is the component of the dependent sum functor, and where “Frob.Rec.” is Frobenius reciprocity.
Since this is natural in UU, the Yoneda lemma implies the claimed morphism.


Proof/Construction 2
There is the composite morphism
(f *∏ f[A,B])×A→counit×id A[A,B]×A→evalB→unitf *∑ fB
  \left(f^\ast \prod_f [A, B]\right) \times A \stackrel{counit \times id_A}{\to} [A, B] \times A \stackrel{eval}{\to} B \stackrel{unit}{\to} f^\ast \sum_f B

of the adjunction (co)units and the evaluation map of the internal hom. Its hom-adjunct is
A→[f *∏ f[A,B],f *∑ fB]≅f *[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB],
  A \to [f^\ast \prod_f [A, B], f^\ast \sum_f B] \cong f^\ast [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
  \,,


using prop.  on the right. The hom-adjunct of that in turn is
∑ fA→[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB]\sum_f A \to [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
and by symmetry the morphism that we are after:
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f [A, B] \to [\sum_f A, \sum_f B]
  \,.



Remark
If YY is the terminal object (for simplicity), then the morphism of prop.  can be understood as follows: a global element of the dependent product ∏ f[A,B]\prod_f [A,B] is given by a commuting diagram in H\mathbf{H} of the form
∑ fA  →  ∑ fB  ↘  ↙   X.
  \array{
    \sum_f A &&\to&& \sum_f B
    \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
  \,.


The map in prop.  picks out the top horizontal morphism in this diagram.

For smooth spaces and smooth ∞\infty-groupoids
Consider the site C=C =  SmthMfd of smooth manifolds (and the open cover coverage) or equivalently over the dense subsite CartSp of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between these.
The sheaf topos/(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) is that of smooth spaces/smooth ∞-groupoids. So the discussion of internal homs here is a special case of the above discussion In a sheaf topos.

Example
For X,Y∈SmthMfd↪HX , Y \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} two smooth manifolds, the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X,Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the mapping space between them regarded as a diffeological space.
See at manifold structure of mapping spaces for when this internal hom is representable again by a smooth manifold.


Example
For X∈SmthMfd↪HX \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} the internal automorphism group, example , of XX is the diffeomorphism group of XX, regarded as a diffeological group
Aut(X)=Diff(X).
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) = \mathbf{Diff}(X)
  \,.


For chain complexes

internal hom of chain complexes

For super vector spaces
The category sVectsVect of super vector spaces is the category of ℤ/2\mathbb{Z}/2-graded vector spaces. Thus, its objects are pairs of vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-), with V +V_+ called the even part and V −V_- the odd part. The morphisms in sVectsVect are likewise pairs of linear maps, i.e. we define sVectsVect to be Vect×Vect=Vect ℤ/2Vect \times Vect = Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2}, as usual for any sort of graded object. With this definition of the category sVectsVect, we capture the concepts of superalgebra and so on in succinct categorical terms.
Because the morphisms in sVectsVect send even things to even things and odd things to odd things, they are sometimes called even linear maps, and one may write
sVect(V,W)=EvenLin(V,W).
 sVect(V, W) = Even Lin(V,W).


Note that sVectsVect is enriched over VectVect, i.e. these hom-sets are vector spaces.
Occasionally, however, one does need to refer to the odd linear maps, which send even things to odd things and odd things to even things. That is, an odd linear map V→WV\to W is a pair of linear maps V +→W −V_+ \to W_- and V −→W +V_-\to W_+. The internal-hom in sVectsVect allows us to capture these as well: it is the following super vector space:
[V,W] +=EvenLin(V,W)[V,W] −=OddLin(V,W).
  [V,W]_+ = Even Lin(V,W) \qquad
  [V,W]_- = Odd Lin(V,W).


With this definition, sVectsVect becomes a closed monoidal category.
We can equivalently regard a super vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-) as being the direct sum vector space V +⊕V −V_+ \oplus V_- equipped with this direct sum decomposition. If we view the internal-hom [V,W][V,W] in this way as well, then we have
[V,W]=EvenLin(V,W)⊕OddLin(V,W)=Lin(V,W).
 [V, W] = Even Lin(V,W) \oplus Odd Lin(V,W) = Lin(V,W).


In other words, any linear map between these “summed” super vector spaces decomposes uniquely as the sum of an even linear map and an odd one.
For Banach spaces
A similar thing happens in the category BanBan of Banach spaces and short linear operators. The external hom consists of only the short linear maps (those bounded by 11):
Ban(V,W)={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖≤1}. Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \leq 1 \} .
This definition of morphism recovers the most specific notion of isomorphism of Banach spaces, as well as defining the product and coproduct as the direct sum completed with p=∞p = \infty or p=1p = 1 respectively.
But the internal hom is the Banach space of all bounded linear maps:
[V,W]={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖<∞}. [V,W] = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \lt \infty \} .
This is a Banach space and makes BanBan into a closed category.
A category consists of a collection of objects together with morphisms between these objects. Thus, naively, we may think of objects as the ‘elements’ of a category.
More generally, in higher category theory the objects of an (n,r)(n,r)-category are the 00-dimensional cells of that structure, the 00-morphisms.
Explicitly
A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.


See at dependent product – In terms of spaces of sections for more on this.
A natural topology on mapping spaces of continuous functions, important because of its role in exhibiting locally compact topological spaces to be exponentiable, as demonstrated below, culminating in Corollary .
The compact-open topology on the set of continuous functions X→YX \to Y is generated by the subbasis of subsets U K⊂C(X,Y)U^K \subset C(X,Y) that map a given compact subspace K⊂XK \subset X to a given open subset U⊂YU \subset Y, whence the name.
When restricting to continuous functions between compactly generated topological spaces one usually modifies this definition to a subbase of open subsets U ϕ(K)U^{\phi(K)}, where now ϕ(K)\phi(K) is the image of a compact topological space under any continuous function ϕ:K→X\phi \colon K \to X. This definition gives a cartesian internal hom in the category of compactly generated topological spaces (see also at convenient category of topological spaces).
The two definitions agree when the domain XX is a compactly generated Hausdorff space, but not in general. Beware that texts on compactly generated spaces nevertheless commonly say “compact-open topology” for the second definition.

Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We denote by Y XY^{X} the set of continuous maps from (X,𝒪 X)(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}) to (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}).


Remark
Other common notations for Y XY^{X} are Map(X,Y)Map(X,Y) or C(X,Y)C(X,Y).


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. We denote by 𝒪 X c\mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} the set of subsets of XX which are compact with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. Let AA be a subset of XX. We denote by A¯\overline{A} the topological closure of AA in XX with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Definition
A topological space (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is locally compact if the set of compact neighbourhoods of points of XX form a neighbourhood basis of XX. That is to say: for every x∈Xx \in X and every neighbourhood NN of xx, there is a V∈𝒪 X cV \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and a U∈𝒪 XU \in \mathcal{O}_{X} such that x∈U⊂V⊂Nx \in U \subset V \subset N.


Remark
There are many variations on this definition, which can be found at locally compact space. These are all equivalent if (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff. We do not however make the assumption that (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. Given A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}, we denote by M A,UM_{A,U} the set of continuous maps f:X→Yf : X \rightarrow Y such that f(A)⊂Uf(A) \subset U.


Definition
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. The compact-open topology on Y XY^{X} is that with sub-basis given by the set of sets M A,UM_{A,U} such that A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We shall denote the compact-open topology (def. ) on Y XY^{X} by 𝒪 Y X\mathcal{O}_{Y^{X}}.

A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.


See at dependent product – In terms of spaces of sections for more on this.
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category and X,Y∈𝒞X, Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the internal hom [X,Y]∈𝒞[X,Y] \in \mathcal{C} from XX to YY is, if it exists, another object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} which behaves like the “object of morphisms” from XX to YY. In other words it is, if it exists, an internal version of the ordinary hom set 𝒞(X,Y)∈Set\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in Set or more generally hom object 𝒞(X,Y)∈𝒱\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in \mathcal{V} of a locally small category or 𝒱\mathcal{V}-enriched category.
One way to make this precise starts by mimicking a property of the function set [X,Y]={f:X→Y}[X,Y] = \{f : X \to Y\} of functions between two sets XX and YY: this set is characterized by the fact that for any other set SS, the functions S→[X,Y]S \to [X,Y] are in natural bijection with the functions S×X→YS \times X \to Y out of the cartesian product of SS with XX. That is: for each set XX, the functor (−)×X(-) \times X has a right adjoint, given by the construction [X,−][X,-].
One can verbalize this thus: taking the cartesian product with the set XX is left-adjoint to taking the set of all functions with domain XX.
This, then, is, generally, the definition of internal hom in any cartesian monoidal category or in fact in any monoidal category (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes): the right adjoint [X,−][X,-] to the given tensor product functor (−)⊗X(-)\otimes X for all objects XX. It may or may not exist. If it exists, one says that (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is a closed monoidal category. Explicity, the condition is that there is an isomorphism(bijection)
𝒞(A,[X,Z])→≃𝒞(A⊗X,Z)
  \mathcal{C}(A, [X,Z]) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathcal{C}(A \otimes X, Z)


which is natural in all three variables. (The rightward map here is often called currying, especially in a closed monoidal category (and more especially for the λ\lambda-calculus).)
In particular this implies that in a closed monoidal category the external hom is re-obtained from the internal hom as its set of generalized elements out of the tensor unit I∈𝒞I \in \mathcal{C} in that
I→[X,Y]X→Y
  \frac{I \to [X,Y]}{X \to Y}


using that I⊗X≃XI \otimes X \simeq X by definition of the tensor unit.
Here “closed” in “closed monoidal category” is in the sense that forming “hom-sets” does not lead “out of the category”. In fact the internal hom of a cartesian monoidal category is indeed the hom as seen in the internal logic of that category (the function type).
More generally, one can consider objects that satisfy some basic universal properties that an internal hom should satisfy even in the absence of a monoidal structure. If such objects exist one speaks therefore just of a closed category. Every closed category may be seen as a category enriched over itself. Accordingly, an internal hom is after all a special case of a hom-object, for the special case of this enrichment over itself.

Definition
(internal hom)
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric monoidal category. An internal hom in 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a functor
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞→𝒞
  [-,-] : \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}


such that for every object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} we have a pair of adjoint functors
((−)⊗X⊣[X,−]):𝒞→𝒞.
  ((-) \otimes X \dashv [X, -]) : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.


If this exists, (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is called a closed monoidal category.


Remark
If the monoidal category 𝒞\mathcal{C} in Def.  is not symmetric, there is instead a concept of left- and right-internal hom.

Evaluation map
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ).

Definition
For X,Y∈𝒞X,Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the evaluation map
eval X,Y:[X,Y]⊗X→Y
  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \otimes X \to Y


is the ((−)⊗X⊣[X,−])((-)\otimes X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the identity id [X,Y]:[X,Y]→[X,Y]id_{[X,Y]} : [X,Y] \to [X,Y].


Remark
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is specifically a locally cartesian closed category, then in terms of the type theory internal language of 𝒞\mathcal{C} the evaluation map is the categorical semantics of the dependent type which in type theory syntax is
f:X→Y,x:X⊢f(x):Y,
  f \colon X \to Y,\; x \colon X 
    \;\vdash\; 
   f(x) \colon Y
  \,,


with function application on the right.

Composition map
Let (𝒞,×)(\mathcal{C}, \times) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. )

Definition
For X,Y,Z∈𝒞X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{C} three objects, the composition morphism
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z]
  \times
  [X, Y]
  \to 
  [X, Z]


is the ((−)×X⊣[X,−])((-)\times X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the following composite of two evaluation maps, def. :
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→(id [Y,Z],eval X,Y)[Y,Z]×Y→eval Y,ZZ.
  [Y, Z] \times [X , Y] \times X 
    \stackrel{(id_{[Y,Z]}, eval_{X,Y})}{\to}
  [Y,Z] \times Y
    \stackrel{eval_{Y,Z}}{\to}
  Z
  \,.


Basic properties
The internal homs in a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ) happen to share all the key abstract properties of ordinary (“external”) hom-functors, even though this is not completely manifest from Def. :

Proposition
(internal hom bifunctor)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric monoidal category such that for each object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} the functor X⊗(−)X \otimes (-) has a right adjoint [X,−][X,-]. Then this is already equivalent to Def. , in that there is a unique functor out of the product categoryof 𝒞\mathcal{C} with its opposite category
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞⟶𝒞
  [-,-]
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}


such that for each X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} it coincides with the internal hom [X,−][X,-] as a functor in the second variable, and such that there is a natural isomorphism
Hom(X,[Y,Z])≃Hom(X⊗Y,Z)
  Hom(X, [Y,Z])
  \;\simeq\;
  Hom(X \otimes Y, Z)


which is natural not only in XX and ZZ, but also in YY.


Proof
We have a natural isomorphism for each fixed YY, and hence in particular for fixed YY and fixed ZZ. With this the statement follows directly by this prop. at adjoint functor.

In fact the 3-variable adjunction from Prop.  even holds internally:

Proposition
(internal tensor/hom-adjunction)
In a closed monoidal category (def. ) there are natural isomorphisms
[X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]]
  [X \otimes Y, Z]
   \;\simeq\;
  [X, [Y,Z]]


whose image under Hom 𝒞(1,−)Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,-) are the defining natural bijections of Prop. .


Proof
Let A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C} be any object. By applying the natural bijections from Prop. , there are composite natural bijections
Hom 𝒞(A,[X⊗Y,Z]) ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗(X⊗Y),Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞((A⊗X)⊗Y,Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗X,[Y,Z])  ≃Hom 𝒞(A,[X,[Y,Z]])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A , [X \otimes Y, Z])
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes (X \otimes Y), Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}((A \otimes X)\otimes Y, Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes X, [Y,Z])
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, [X, [Y,Z]])
  \end{aligned}


Since this holds for all AA, the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding says that there is an isomorphism [X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]][ X\otimes Y, Z ] \simeq [X, [Y,Z]]. Moreover, by taking A=1A = 1 in the above and using the left unitor isomorphisms A⊗(X⊗Y)≃X⊗YA \otimes (X \otimes Y) \simeq X \otimes Y and A⊗X≃XA\otimes X \simeq X we get a commuting diagram
Hom 𝒞(1,[X⊗Y,Z]) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(1,[X,[Y,Z]])  ≃↓  ↓ ≃ Hom 𝒞(X⊗Y,Z) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(X,[Y,Z]).
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1, [X\otimes Y, Z ])
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1, [X, [Y,Z]])
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X \otimes Y, Z)
     &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, [Y,Z])
  }
  \,.


Also the key respect of hom-functors for limits is inherited by internal hom-functors:

Proposition
(internal hom-functor preserves limits)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric closed monoidal category with internal hom-bifunctor [−,−][-,-] (Prop. ). Then this bifunctor preserves limits in the second variable, and sends colimits in the first variable to limits:
[X,lim⟵j∈𝒥Y(j)]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[X,Y(j)]
  [X, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} Y(j)]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [X, Y(j)]


and
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X]
  [\underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j),X]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j),X]  



Proof
For X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} any object, [X,−][X,-] is a right adjoint by definition, and hence preserves limits by adjoints preserve (co-)limits.
For the other case, let Y:ℒ→𝒞Y \;\colon\; \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{C} be a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, and let C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C} be any object. Then there are isomorphisms
Hom 𝒞(C,[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]) ≃Hom 𝒞(C⊗lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X)  ≃Hom 𝒞(lim⟶j∈𝒥(C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞((C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞(C,[Y(j),X])  ≃Hom 𝒞(C,lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C, [ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X ] )
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C \otimes \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X )
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} (C \otimes Y(j)), X )   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( (C \otimes Y(j)), X )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, [Y(j), X] )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X] )    
  \end{aligned}


which are natural in C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C}, where we used that the ordinary hom-functor respects (co)limits as shown (see at hom-functor preserves limits), and that the left adjoint C⊗(−)C \otimes (-) preserves colimits (see at adjoints preserve (co-)limits).
Hence by the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding, there is an isomorphism
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]⟶≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X].
  \left[ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X \right]  
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X] 
  \,.


Relation to function types
The internal hom is the categorical semantics of what in type theory are function types

Induced monad (state monad)
For each object SS the (internal hom ⊣\dashv tensor product)-adjunction induces a monad [S,S⊗(−)][S, S \otimes (-)]. In computer science this monad (in computer science) is called the state monad.
Stable splitting
In topology the stabilization/suspension spectrum Σ ∞Maps(X,A)\Sigma^\infty  Maps(X,A) of mapping spaces Maps(X,A)Maps(X,A) between suitable CW-complexes X,AX, A happens to decompose as a direct sum of spectra in a useful way, related to the expression of the Goodwillie derivatives of the functor Maps(X,−)Maps(X,-).
For more on this see at stable splitting of mapping spaces.
In sets
In the category Set of sets, regarded as a cartesian monoidal category, the internal hom is given by function sets. This exists, by the discussion there, as soon as the foundational axioms are strong enough, for instance as soon as there are power objects, which is the special case of a function set into the 2-element set.
In simplicial sets
In the category sSet of simplicial sets, the internal hom between two simplicial sets X,YX,Y is given by the formula
[X,Y] n=Hom sSet(X×Δ[n],Y),
  [X,Y]_n = Hom_{sSet}(X\times \Delta[n],Y)
  \,,


where Δ[n]\Delta[n] is the simplicial n-simplex. This [X,Y]∈sSet[X,Y] \in sSet is also called the function complex between XX and YY.
Since sSet≃PSh(Δ)sSet \simeq PSh(\Delta) is the category of presheaves over the simplex category, this is a special case of internal homs in sheaf toposes, discussed below.
In a sheaf topos or (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaf (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos
Let CC be a site. Let H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) be the sheaf topos over CC or in fact the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos. We discuss the internal hom of this regard as a cartesian monoidal category/cartesian monoidal (∞,1)-category.

Proposition
The sheaf topos H\mathbf{H} is a cartesian closed category / cartesian closed (∞,1)-category. In fact it is a locally cartesian closed category / locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.

Hence the internal hom exist.

Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H} two objects, the internal hom-object
[X,Y]∈H
  [X,Y] \in \mathbf{H}


is the sheaf/(∞,1)-sheaf given by the assignment
[X,Y]:U↦H(U×X,Y),
  [X,Y] : U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,,


for all objects U∈CU \in C which on the right we regard under the Yoneda embedding/∞-Yoneda embedding U∈C↪YonedaHU \in C \stackrel{Yoneda}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}.
Here


U×X∈HU \times X \in \mathbf{H} is the cartesian product of UU with XX


H(−,−)\mathbf{H}(-,-) is the hom set-functor / hom space-(∞,1)-functor of H\mathbf{H}.



See also at closed monoidal structure on presheaves.

Proof
By the Yoneda lemma/(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma we have natural equivalences
[X,Y](U)≃H(U,[X,Y])
  [X,Y](U) \simeq \mathbf{H}(U , [X,Y])


and by the defining ((−)×X⊢[X,−])((-)\times X \vdash [X,-])adjunction this is naturally equivalent to
⋯≃H(U×X,Y).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,.



Remark
In the (homotopy-)type theory syntax of the internal language of H\mathbf{H} the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X, Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the categorical semantics of the function type
⊢(X→Y):Type.
  \vdash (X \to Y) : Type
  \,.



Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H}, the evaluation map, def. ,
eval X,Y:[X,Y]×X→Y
  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \times X \to Y


is the morphism of sheaves which over each U∈CU \in C sends a morphism of sheaves θ:H(−,U)×X(−)→Y(−)\theta : \mathbf{H}(-,U) \times X(-) \to Y(-) (which is the first component by prop. ) and an x∈H(U,X)x \in \mathbf{H}(U,X) to
eval X,Y(U):(θ,x)↦θ U(id U,x)∈Y(U).
  eval_{X,Y}(U) : (\theta, x) \mapsto \theta_U(id_U, x) \in Y(U)
  \,.


See (MacLane-Moerdijk, p. 46).

Proposition
For X,Y,Z∈HX, Y, Z \in \mathbf{H} three objects of H\mathbf{H}, the canonical composition morphism, def. ,
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z] \times [X, Y] \to [X, Z]


is given by the morphism of presheaves/(∞,1)-presheaves whose component over U∈CU \in C is the morphism of sets/∞-groupoids
∘ X,Y,Z(U):H(U×X,Y)×H(U×Y,Z)→H(U×X,Z)
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \times
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Z)


which sends a pair (f:U×X→Y,g:U×Y→Z)(f : U \times X \to Y, g : U \times Y \to Z) to the composite
∘ X,Y,Z(U)(f,g)=U×X→(Δ U,id X)U×U×X→(id U,f)U×Y→gZ,
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)(f,g)
  = 
  U \times X 
  \stackrel{(\Delta_U, id_X)}{\to}
  U \times U \times X
  \stackrel{(id_U, f)}{\to}
  U \times Y 
  \stackrel{g}{\to}
  Z
  \,,


where Δ U:U→U×U\Delta_U : U \to U \times U is the diagonal morphism on UU.


Proof
By definition  the morphism is the adjunct of the double evaluation map
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→Z.
  [Y,Z] \times [X,Y] \times X \to Z
  \,.


Since the cartesian product of two sheaves A,B∈HA, B \in \mathbf{H} is computed objectwise
A×B:U↦A(U)×B(U)
  A \times B : U \mapsto A(U) \times B(U)


it follows that over each U∈CU \in C this double evaluation map is the morphism of sets/∞\infty-groupoids
[Y,Z](U)×[X,Y](U)×X(U)→Z(U)
  [Y,Z](U) \times [X,Y](U) \times X(U) \to Z(U)


hence by prop. 
H(U×Y,Z)×H(U×X,Y)×H(U,X)→H(U,Z),
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z) \times \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y) \times 
  \mathbf{H}(U,X) \to \mathbf{H}(U,Z)
  \,,


where now by prop.  this is the external evaluation.


Remark
Intuitively this says that the composite of a UU-parameterized family of maps {f(u):X→Y|u∈U}\{f(u) :  X \to Y| u \in U\} with a UU-parameterized family of maps g(u):Y→Z|u∈U{g(u) : Y \to Z| u \in U} is the UU-family given by the parameter-wise composite {g(u)∘f(u)|u∈U}\{g(u)\circ f(u) | u \in U\}.


Example
The internal automorphism group/automorphism ∞-group of an object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} is the subobject
Aut(X)↪[X,X]
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow [X,X]


of the internal hom which is maximal subject to the property that the composition of prop.  becomes invertible.
The (homotopy-)type theory syntax for this is given by the type of equivalences in homotopy type theory
⊢(X→≃X):Type.
  \vdash (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X) : Type
  \,.


In slice categories
Let H\mathbf{H} be a locally cartesian closed category. This means that for each object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the slice category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is a cartesian closed category. The product in the slice is given by the fiber product over XX computed in H\mathbf{H}. Fairly detailed discussion of constructions of the internal hom in such slices H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is at locally cartesian closed category – cartesian closure in terms of base change and dependent product.
We record some further properties

Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a locally cartesian closed category and f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, the inverse image f *f^* of the corresponding base change adjunction
𝒞 /X→∏ f←f *→∑ f𝒞 /Y
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_f}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_f}{\to}}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}


is a cartesian closed functor.

This is discussed in more detail at cartesian closed functor – Examples.
So for A,B∈𝒞 /YA,B \in \mathcal{C}_{/Y} we have isomorphisms
f *[A,B]→≃[f *A,f *B]
  f^* \left[A,B\right] \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \left[f^* A , f^* B\right]


between the image of the internal hom under f *f^* and the internal hom of the images of AA and BB separately.

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a locally cartesian closed category, f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism, and A,B∈H /XA, B \in \mathbf{H}_{/X} two objects in the slice over XX, there is a natural morphism (not in general an isomorphism)
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f \left[A,B \right] \to \left[ \sum_f A, \sum_f B\right]
  \,.


Here are two ways to get this morphism:

Proof/Construction 1
For any object U∈H /YU \in \mathbf{H}_{/Y} we have a canonical morphism of hom sets
H /Y(U,∏ f[A,B]) ≃H /X(f *U,[A,B])  ≃H /X(f *U×A,B)  →H /Y(∑ f(f *U×A),∑ fB)  ≃Frob.Rec.H /Y(U×∑ fA,∑ fB)  ≃H /Y(U,[∑ fA,∑ fB])
  \begin{aligned}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U, \prod_f [A,B] )
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}( f^* U, [A,B] )
     \\
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}(f^* U \times A, B)
     \\
     & \stackrel{}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( \sum_f( f^* U \times A ), \sum_f B )
    \\
     & \stackrel{Frob.Rec.}{\simeq}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U \times \sum_f A , \sum_f B )
     \\
     & \simeq
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}(U, [\sum_f A , \sum_f B])
  \end{aligned}


where the first and the last steps use adjunction properties, where the morphism in the middle is the component of the dependent sum functor, and where “Frob.Rec.” is Frobenius reciprocity.
Since this is natural in UU, the Yoneda lemma implies the claimed morphism.


Proof/Construction 2
There is the composite morphism
(f *∏ f[A,B])×A→counit×id A[A,B]×A→evalB→unitf *∑ fB
  \left(f^\ast \prod_f [A, B]\right) \times A \stackrel{counit \times id_A}{\to} [A, B] \times A \stackrel{eval}{\to} B \stackrel{unit}{\to} f^\ast \sum_f B

of the adjunction (co)units and the evaluation map of the internal hom. Its hom-adjunct is
A→[f *∏ f[A,B],f *∑ fB]≅f *[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB],
  A \to [f^\ast \prod_f [A, B], f^\ast \sum_f B] \cong f^\ast [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
  \,,


using prop.  on the right. The hom-adjunct of that in turn is
∑ fA→[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB]\sum_f A \to [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
and by symmetry the morphism that we are after:
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f [A, B] \to [\sum_f A, \sum_f B]
  \,.



Remark
If YY is the terminal object (for simplicity), then the morphism of prop.  can be understood as follows: a global element of the dependent product ∏ f[A,B]\prod_f [A,B] is given by a commuting diagram in H\mathbf{H} of the form
∑ fA  →  ∑ fB  ↘  ↙   X.
  \array{
    \sum_f A &&\to&& \sum_f B
    \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
  \,.


The map in prop.  picks out the top horizontal morphism in this diagram.

For smooth spaces and smooth ∞\infty-groupoids
Consider the site C=C =  SmthMfd of smooth manifolds (and the open cover coverage) or equivalently over the dense subsite CartSp of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between these.
The sheaf topos/(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) is that of smooth spaces/smooth ∞-groupoids. So the discussion of internal homs here is a special case of the above discussion In a sheaf topos.

Example
For X,Y∈SmthMfd↪HX , Y \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} two smooth manifolds, the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X,Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the mapping space between them regarded as a diffeological space.
See at manifold structure of mapping spaces for when this internal hom is representable again by a smooth manifold.


Example
For X∈SmthMfd↪HX \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} the internal automorphism group, example , of XX is the diffeomorphism group of XX, regarded as a diffeological group
Aut(X)=Diff(X).
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) = \mathbf{Diff}(X)
  \,.


For chain complexes

internal hom of chain complexes

For super vector spaces
The category sVectsVect of super vector spaces is the category of ℤ/2\mathbb{Z}/2-graded vector spaces. Thus, its objects are pairs of vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-), with V +V_+ called the even part and V −V_- the odd part. The morphisms in sVectsVect are likewise pairs of linear maps, i.e. we define sVectsVect to be Vect×Vect=Vect ℤ/2Vect \times Vect = Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2}, as usual for any sort of graded object. With this definition of the category sVectsVect, we capture the concepts of superalgebra and so on in succinct categorical terms.
Because the morphisms in sVectsVect send even things to even things and odd things to odd things, they are sometimes called even linear maps, and one may write
sVect(V,W)=EvenLin(V,W).
 sVect(V, W) = Even Lin(V,W).


Note that sVectsVect is enriched over VectVect, i.e. these hom-sets are vector spaces.
Occasionally, however, one does need to refer to the odd linear maps, which send even things to odd things and odd things to even things. That is, an odd linear map V→WV\to W is a pair of linear maps V +→W −V_+ \to W_- and V −→W +V_-\to W_+. The internal-hom in sVectsVect allows us to capture these as well: it is the following super vector space:
[V,W] +=EvenLin(V,W)[V,W] −=OddLin(V,W).
  [V,W]_+ = Even Lin(V,W) \qquad
  [V,W]_- = Odd Lin(V,W).


With this definition, sVectsVect becomes a closed monoidal category.
We can equivalently regard a super vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-) as being the direct sum vector space V +⊕V −V_+ \oplus V_- equipped with this direct sum decomposition. If we view the internal-hom [V,W][V,W] in this way as well, then we have
[V,W]=EvenLin(V,W)⊕OddLin(V,W)=Lin(V,W).
 [V, W] = Even Lin(V,W) \oplus Odd Lin(V,W) = Lin(V,W).


In other words, any linear map between these “summed” super vector spaces decomposes uniquely as the sum of an even linear map and an odd one.
For Banach spaces
A similar thing happens in the category BanBan of Banach spaces and short linear operators. The external hom consists of only the short linear maps (those bounded by 11):
Ban(V,W)={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖≤1}. Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \leq 1 \} .
This definition of morphism recovers the most specific notion of isomorphism of Banach spaces, as well as defining the product and coproduct as the direct sum completed with p=∞p = \infty or p=1p = 1 respectively.
But the internal hom is the Banach space of all bounded linear maps:
[V,W]={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖<∞}. [V,W] = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \lt \infty \} .
This is a Banach space and makes BanBan into a closed category.
Explicitly
A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.

A natural topology on mapping spaces of continuous functions, important because of its role in exhibiting locally compact topological spaces to be exponentiable, as demonstrated below, culminating in Corollary .
The compact-open topology on the set of continuous functions X→YX \to Y is generated by the subbasis of subsets U K⊂C(X,Y)U^K \subset C(X,Y) that map a given compact subspace K⊂XK \subset X to a given open subset U⊂YU \subset Y, whence the name.
When restricting to continuous functions between compactly generated topological spaces one usually modifies this definition to a subbase of open subsets U ϕ(K)U^{\phi(K)}, where now ϕ(K)\phi(K) is the image of a compact topological space under any continuous function ϕ:K→X\phi \colon K \to X. This definition gives a cartesian internal hom in the category of compactly generated topological spaces (see also at convenient category of topological spaces).
The two definitions agree when the domain XX is a compactly generated Hausdorff space, but not in general. Beware that texts on compactly generated spaces nevertheless commonly say “compact-open topology” for the second definition.

Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We denote by Y XY^{X} the set of continuous maps from (X,𝒪 X)(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}) to (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}).


Remark
Other common notations for Y XY^{X} are Map(X,Y)Map(X,Y) or C(X,Y)C(X,Y).


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. We denote by 𝒪 X c\mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} the set of subsets of XX which are compact with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. Let AA be a subset of XX. We denote by A¯\overline{A} the topological closure of AA in XX with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Definition
A topological space (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is locally compact if the set of compact neighbourhoods of points of XX form a neighbourhood basis of XX. That is to say: for every x∈Xx \in X and every neighbourhood NN of xx, there is a V∈𝒪 X cV \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and a U∈𝒪 XU \in \mathcal{O}_{X} such that x∈U⊂V⊂Nx \in U \subset V \subset N.


Remark
There are many variations on this definition, which can be found at locally compact space. These are all equivalent if (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff. We do not however make the assumption that (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. Given A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}, we denote by M A,UM_{A,U} the set of continuous maps f:X→Yf : X \rightarrow Y such that f(A)⊂Uf(A) \subset U.


Definition
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. The compact-open topology on Y XY^{X} is that with sub-basis given by the set of sets M A,UM_{A,U} such that A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We shall denote the compact-open topology (def. ) on Y XY^{X} by 𝒪 Y X\mathcal{O}_{Y^{X}}.

A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that

For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a category and X,Y∈𝒞X, Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the internal hom [X,Y]∈𝒞[X,Y] \in \mathcal{C} from XX to YY is, if it exists, another object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} which behaves like the “object of morphisms” from XX to YY. In other words it is, if it exists, an internal version of the ordinary hom set 𝒞(X,Y)∈Set\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in Set or more generally hom object 𝒞(X,Y)∈𝒱\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \in \mathcal{V} of a locally small category or 𝒱\mathcal{V}-enriched category.
One way to make this precise starts by mimicking a property of the function set [X,Y]={f:X→Y}[X,Y] = \{f : X \to Y\} of functions between two sets XX and YY: this set is characterized by the fact that for any other set SS, the functions S→[X,Y]S \to [X,Y] are in natural bijection with the functions S×X→YS \times X \to Y out of the cartesian product of SS with XX. That is: for each set XX, the functor (−)×X(-) \times X has a right adjoint, given by the construction [X,−][X,-].
One can verbalize this thus: taking the cartesian product with the set XX is left-adjoint to taking the set of all functions with domain XX.
This, then, is, generally, the definition of internal hom in any cartesian monoidal category or in fact in any monoidal category (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes): the right adjoint [X,−][X,-] to the given tensor product functor (−)⊗X(-)\otimes X for all objects XX. It may or may not exist. If it exists, one says that (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is a closed monoidal category. Explicity, the condition is that there is an isomorphism(bijection)
𝒞(A,[X,Z])→≃𝒞(A⊗X,Z)
  \mathcal{C}(A, [X,Z]) \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \mathcal{C}(A \otimes X, Z)


which is natural in all three variables. (The rightward map here is often called currying, especially in a closed monoidal category (and more especially for the λ\lambda-calculus).)
In particular this implies that in a closed monoidal category the external hom is re-obtained from the internal hom as its set of generalized elements out of the tensor unit I∈𝒞I \in \mathcal{C} in that
I→[X,Y]X→Y
  \frac{I \to [X,Y]}{X \to Y}


using that I⊗X≃XI \otimes X \simeq X by definition of the tensor unit.
Here “closed” in “closed monoidal category” is in the sense that forming “hom-sets” does not lead “out of the category”. In fact the internal hom of a cartesian monoidal category is indeed the hom as seen in the internal logic of that category (the function type).
More generally, one can consider objects that satisfy some basic universal properties that an internal hom should satisfy even in the absence of a monoidal structure. If such objects exist one speaks therefore just of a closed category. Every closed category may be seen as a category enriched over itself. Accordingly, an internal hom is after all a special case of a hom-object, for the special case of this enrichment over itself.

Definition
(internal hom)
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric monoidal category. An internal hom in 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a functor
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞→𝒞
  [-,-] : \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}


such that for every object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} we have a pair of adjoint functors
((−)⊗X⊣[X,−]):𝒞→𝒞.
  ((-) \otimes X \dashv [X, -]) : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.


If this exists, (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) is called a closed monoidal category.


Remark
If the monoidal category 𝒞\mathcal{C} in Def.  is not symmetric, there is instead a concept of left- and right-internal hom.

Evaluation map
Let (𝒞,⊗)(\mathcal{C}, \otimes) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ).

Definition
For X,Y∈𝒞X,Y \in \mathcal{C} two objects, the evaluation map
eval X,Y:[X,Y]⊗X→Y
  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \otimes X \to Y


is the ((−)⊗X⊣[X,−])((-)\otimes X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the identity id [X,Y]:[X,Y]→[X,Y]id_{[X,Y]} : [X,Y] \to [X,Y].


Remark
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is specifically a locally cartesian closed category, then in terms of the type theory internal language of 𝒞\mathcal{C} the evaluation map is the categorical semantics of the dependent type which in type theory syntax is
f:X→Y,x:X⊢f(x):Y,
  f \colon X \to Y,\; x \colon X 
    \;\vdash\; 
   f(x) \colon Y
  \,,


with function application on the right.

Composition map
Let (𝒞,×)(\mathcal{C}, \times) be a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. )

Definition
For X,Y,Z∈𝒞X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{C} three objects, the composition morphism
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z]
  \times
  [X, Y]
  \to 
  [X, Z]


is the ((−)×X⊣[X,−])((-)\times X \dashv [X,-])-adjunct of the following composite of two evaluation maps, def. :
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→(id [Y,Z],eval X,Y)[Y,Z]×Y→eval Y,ZZ.
  [Y, Z] \times [X , Y] \times X 
    \stackrel{(id_{[Y,Z]}, eval_{X,Y})}{\to}
  [Y,Z] \times Y
    \stackrel{eval_{Y,Z}}{\to}
  Z
  \,.


Basic properties
The internal homs in a symmetric closed monoidal category (Def. ) happen to share all the key abstract properties of ordinary (“external”) hom-functors, even though this is not completely manifest from Def. :

Proposition
(internal hom bifunctor)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric monoidal category such that for each object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} the functor X⊗(−)X \otimes (-) has a right adjoint [X,−][X,-]. Then this is already equivalent to Def. , in that there is a unique functor out of the product categoryof 𝒞\mathcal{C} with its opposite category
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞⟶𝒞
  [-,-]
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C}
    \longrightarrow
  \mathcal{C}


such that for each X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} it coincides with the internal hom [X,−][X,-] as a functor in the second variable, and such that there is a natural isomorphism
Hom(X,[Y,Z])≃Hom(X⊗Y,Z)
  Hom(X, [Y,Z])
  \;\simeq\;
  Hom(X \otimes Y, Z)


which is natural not only in XX and ZZ, but also in YY.


Proof
We have a natural isomorphism for each fixed YY, and hence in particular for fixed YY and fixed ZZ. With this the statement follows directly by this prop. at adjoint functor.

In fact the 3-variable adjunction from Prop.  even holds internally:

Proposition
(internal tensor/hom-adjunction)
In a closed monoidal category (def. ) there are natural isomorphisms
[X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]]
  [X \otimes Y, Z]
   \;\simeq\;
  [X, [Y,Z]]


whose image under Hom 𝒞(1,−)Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1,-) are the defining natural bijections of Prop. .


Proof
Let A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C} be any object. By applying the natural bijections from Prop. , there are composite natural bijections
Hom 𝒞(A,[X⊗Y,Z]) ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗(X⊗Y),Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞((A⊗X)⊗Y,Z)  ≃Hom 𝒞(A⊗X,[Y,Z])  ≃Hom 𝒞(A,[X,[Y,Z]])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A , [X \otimes Y, Z])
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes (X \otimes Y), Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}((A \otimes X)\otimes Y, Z)
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A \otimes X, [Y,Z])
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, [X, [Y,Z]])
  \end{aligned}


Since this holds for all AA, the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding says that there is an isomorphism [X⊗Y,Z]≃[X,[Y,Z]][ X\otimes Y, Z ] \simeq [X, [Y,Z]]. Moreover, by taking A=1A = 1 in the above and using the left unitor isomorphisms A⊗(X⊗Y)≃X⊗YA \otimes (X \otimes Y) \simeq X \otimes Y and A⊗X≃XA\otimes X \simeq X we get a commuting diagram
Hom 𝒞(1,[X⊗Y,Z]) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(1,[X,[Y,Z]])  ≃↓  ↓ ≃ Hom 𝒞(X⊗Y,Z) ⟶≃ Hom 𝒞(X,[Y,Z]).
  \array{
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1, [X\otimes Y, Z ])
      &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(1, [X, [Y,Z]])
    \\
    {}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\downarrow
      &&
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X \otimes Y, Z)
     &\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}&
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(X, [Y,Z])
  }
  \,.


Also the key respect of hom-functors for limits is inherited by internal hom-functors:

Proposition
(internal hom-functor preserves limits)
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a symmetric closed monoidal category with internal hom-bifunctor [−,−][-,-] (Prop. ). Then this bifunctor preserves limits in the second variable, and sends colimits in the first variable to limits:
[X,lim⟵j∈𝒥Y(j)]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[X,Y(j)]
  [X, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} Y(j)]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [X, Y(j)]


and
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X]
  [\underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j),X]
  \;\simeq\;
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j),X]  



Proof
For X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} any object, [X,−][X,-] is a right adjoint by definition, and hence preserves limits by adjoints preserve (co-)limits.
For the other case, let Y:ℒ→𝒞Y \;\colon\; \mathcal{L} \to \mathcal{C} be a diagram in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, and let C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C} be any object. Then there are isomorphisms
Hom 𝒞(C,[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]) ≃Hom 𝒞(C⊗lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X)  ≃Hom 𝒞(lim⟶j∈𝒥(C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞((C⊗Y(j)),X)  ≃lim⟵j∈𝒥Hom 𝒞(C,[Y(j),X])  ≃Hom 𝒞(C,lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X])
  \begin{aligned}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(C, [ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X ] )
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C \otimes \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X )
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} (C \otimes Y(j)), X )   
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( (C \otimes Y(j)), X )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim}
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, [Y(j), X] )    
    \\
    & \simeq
    Hom_{\mathcal{C}}( C, \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X] )    
  \end{aligned}


which are natural in C∈𝒞C \in \mathcal{C}, where we used that the ordinary hom-functor respects (co)limits as shown (see at hom-functor preserves limits), and that the left adjoint C⊗(−)C \otimes (-) preserves colimits (see at adjoints preserve (co-)limits).
Hence by the fully faithfulness of the Yoneda embedding, there is an isomorphism
[lim⟶j∈𝒥Y(j),X]⟶≃lim⟵j∈𝒥[Y(j),X].
  \left[ \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longrightarrow}}{\lim} Y(j), X \right]  
  \overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow}
  \underset{\underset{j \in \mathcal{J}}{\longleftarrow}}{\lim} [Y(j), X] 
  \,.

Induced monad (state monad)
For each object SS the (internal hom ⊣\dashv tensor product)-adjunction induces a monad [S,S⊗(−)][S, S \otimes (-)]. In computer science this monad (in computer science) is called the state monad.
Stable splitting
In topology the stabilization/suspension spectrum Σ ∞Maps(X,A)\Sigma^\infty  Maps(X,A) of mapping spaces Maps(X,A)Maps(X,A) between suitable CW-complexes X,AX, A happens to decompose as a direct sum of spectra in a useful way, related to the expression of the Goodwillie derivatives of the functor Maps(X,−)Maps(X,-).
For more on this see at stable splitting of mapping spaces.
In sets
In the category Set of sets, regarded as a cartesian monoidal category, the internal hom is given by function sets. This exists, by the discussion there, as soon as the foundational axioms are strong enough, for instance as soon as there are power objects, which is the special case of a function set into the 2-element set.
In simplicial sets
In the category sSet of simplicial sets, the internal hom between two simplicial sets X,YX,Y is given by the formula
[X,Y] n=Hom sSet(X×Δ[n],Y),
  [X,Y]_n = Hom_{sSet}(X\times \Delta[n],Y)
  \,,


where Δ[n]\Delta[n] is the simplicial n-simplex. This [X,Y]∈sSet[X,Y] \in sSet is also called the function complex between XX and YY.
Since sSet≃PSh(Δ)sSet \simeq PSh(\Delta) is the category of presheaves over the simplex category, this is a special case of internal homs in sheaf toposes, discussed below.
In a sheaf topos or (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaf (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos
Let CC be a site. Let H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) be the sheaf topos over CC or in fact the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos. We discuss the internal hom of this regard as a cartesian monoidal category/cartesian monoidal (∞,1)-category.

Proposition
The sheaf topos H\mathbf{H} is a cartesian closed category / cartesian closed (∞,1)-category. In fact it is a locally cartesian closed category / locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category.

Hence the internal hom exist.

Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H} two objects, the internal hom-object
[X,Y]∈H
  [X,Y] \in \mathbf{H}


is the sheaf/(∞,1)-sheaf given by the assignment
[X,Y]:U↦H(U×X,Y),
  [X,Y] : U \mapsto \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,,


for all objects U∈CU \in C which on the right we regard under the Yoneda embedding/∞-Yoneda embedding U∈C↪YonedaHU \in C \stackrel{Yoneda}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbf{H}.
Here


U×X∈HU \times X \in \mathbf{H} is the cartesian product of UU with XX


H(−,−)\mathbf{H}(-,-) is the hom set-functor / hom space-(∞,1)-functor of H\mathbf{H}.



See also at closed monoidal structure on presheaves.

Proof
By the Yoneda lemma/(∞,1)-Yoneda lemma we have natural equivalences
[X,Y](U)≃H(U,[X,Y])
  [X,Y](U) \simeq \mathbf{H}(U , [X,Y])


and by the defining ((−)×X⊢[X,−])((-)\times X \vdash [X,-])adjunction this is naturally equivalent to
⋯≃H(U×X,Y).
  \cdots \simeq \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \,.



Remark
In the (homotopy-)type theory syntax of the internal language of H\mathbf{H} the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X, Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the categorical semantics of the function type
⊢(X→Y):Type.
  \vdash (X \to Y) : Type
  \,.



Proposition
For X,Y∈HX, Y \in \mathbf{H}, the evaluation map, def. ,

  eval_{X,Y} : [X,Y] \times X \to Y


is the morphism of sheaves which over each U∈CU \in C sends a morphism of sheaves θ:H(−,U)×X(−)→Y(−)\theta : \mathbf{H}(-,U) \times X(-) \to Y(-) (which is the first component by prop. ) and an x∈H(U,X)x \in \mathbf{H}(U,X) to
eval X,Y(U):(θ,x)↦θ U(id U,x)∈Y(U).
  eval_{X,Y}(U) : (\theta, x) \mapsto \theta_U(id_U, x) \in Y(U)
  \,.


See (MacLane-Moerdijk, p. 46).

Proposition
For X,Y,Z∈HX, Y, Z \in \mathbf{H} three objects of H\mathbf{H}, the canonical composition morphism, def. ,
∘ X,Y,Z:[Y,Z]×[X,Y]→[X,Z]
  \circ_{X,Y,Z} : 
  [Y, Z] \times [X, Y] \to [X, Z]


is given by the morphism of presheaves/(∞,1)-presheaves whose component over U∈CU \in C is the morphism of sets/∞-groupoids
∘ X,Y,Z(U):H(U×X,Y)×H(U×Y,Z)→H(U×X,Z)
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)
  : 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y)
  \times
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z)
  \to 
  \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Z)


which sends a pair (f:U×X→Y,g:U×Y→Z)(f : U \times X \to Y, g : U \times Y \to Z) to the composite
∘ X,Y,Z(U)(f,g)=U×X→(Δ U,id X)U×U×X→(id U,f)U×Y→gZ,
  \circ_{X,Y,Z}(U)(f,g)
  = 
  U \times X 
  \stackrel{(\Delta_U, id_X)}{\to}
  U \times U \times X
  \stackrel{(id_U, f)}{\to}
  U \times Y 
  \stackrel{g}{\to}
  Z
  \,,


where Δ U:U→U×U\Delta_U : U \to U \times U is the diagonal morphism on UU.


Proof
By definition  the morphism is the adjunct of the double evaluation map
[Y,Z]×[X,Y]×X→Z.
  [Y,Z] \times [X,Y] \times X \to Z
  \,.


Since the cartesian product of two sheaves A,B∈HA, B \in \mathbf{H} is computed objectwise
A×B:U↦A(U)×B(U)
  A \times B : U \mapsto A(U) \times B(U)


it follows that over each U∈CU \in C this double evaluation map is the morphism of sets/∞\infty-groupoids
[Y,Z](U)×[X,Y](U)×X(U)→Z(U)
  [Y,Z](U) \times [X,Y](U) \times X(U) \to Z(U)


hence by prop. 
H(U×Y,Z)×H(U×X,Y)×H(U,X)→H(U,Z),
  \mathbf{H}(U \times Y, Z) \times \mathbf{H}(U \times X, Y) \times 
  \mathbf{H}(U,X) \to \mathbf{H}(U,Z)
  \,,


where now by prop.  this is the external evaluation.


Remark
Intuitively this says that the composite of a UU-parameterized family of maps {f(u):X→Y|u∈U}\{f(u) :  X \to Y| u \in U\} with a UU-parameterized family of maps g(u):Y→Z|u∈U{g(u) : Y \to Z| u \in U} is the UU-family given by the parameter-wise composite {g(u)∘f(u)|u∈U}\{g(u)\circ f(u) | u \in U\}.


Example
The internal automorphism group/automorphism ∞-group of an object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} is the subobject
Aut(X)↪[X,X]
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow [X,X]


of the internal hom which is maximal subject to the property that the composition of prop.  becomes invertible.
The (homotopy-)type theory syntax for this is given by the type of equivalences in homotopy type theory
⊢(X→≃X):Type.
  \vdash (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X) : Type
  \,.


In slice categories
Let H\mathbf{H} be a locally cartesian closed category. This means that for each object X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the slice category H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is a cartesian closed category. The product in the slice is given by the fiber product over XX computed in H\mathbf{H}. Fairly detailed discussion of constructions of the internal hom in such slices H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X} is at locally cartesian closed category – cartesian closure in terms of base change and dependent product.
We record some further properties

Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a locally cartesian closed category and f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism in 𝒞\mathcal{C}, the inverse image f *f^* of the corresponding base change adjunction
𝒞 /X→∏ f←f *→∑ f𝒞 /Y
  \mathcal{C}_{/X}
   \stackrel{\overset{\sum_f}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\prod_f}{\to}}}
  \mathcal{C}_{/Y}


is a cartesian closed functor.

This is discussed in more detail at cartesian closed functor – Examples.
So for A,B∈𝒞 /YA,B \in \mathcal{C}_{/Y} we have isomorphisms
f *[A,B]→≃[f *A,f *B]
  f^* \left[A,B\right] \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} \left[f^* A , f^* B\right]


between the image of the internal hom under f *f^* and the internal hom of the images of AA and BB separately.

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} a locally cartesian closed category, f:X→Yf \colon X \to Y any morphism, and A,B∈H /XA, B \in \mathbf{H}_{/X} two objects in the slice over XX, there is a natural morphism (not in general an isomorphism)
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f \left[A,B \right] \to \left[ \sum_f A, \sum_f B\right]
  \,.


Here are two ways to get this morphism:

Proof/Construction 1
For any object U∈H /YU \in \mathbf{H}_{/Y} we have a canonical morphism of hom sets
H /Y(U,∏ f[A,B]) ≃H /X(f *U,[A,B])  ≃H /X(f *U×A,B)  →H /Y(∑ f(f *U×A),∑ fB)  ≃Frob.Rec.H /Y(U×∑ fA,∑ fB)  ≃H /Y(U,[∑ fA,∑ fB])
  \begin{aligned}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U, \prod_f [A,B] )
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}( f^* U, [A,B] )
     \\
     & \simeq
     \mathbf{H}_{/X}(f^* U \times A, B)
     \\
     & \stackrel{}{\to}
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( \sum_f( f^* U \times A ), \sum_f B )
    \\
     & \stackrel{Frob.Rec.}{\simeq}
     \mathbf{H}_{/Y}( U \times \sum_f A , \sum_f B )
     \\
     & \simeq
    \mathbf{H}_{/Y}(U, [\sum_f A , \sum_f B])
  \end{aligned}


where the first and the last steps use adjunction properties, where the morphism in the middle is the component of the dependent sum functor, and where “Frob.Rec.” is Frobenius reciprocity.
Since this is natural in UU, the Yoneda lemma implies the claimed morphism.


Proof/Construction 2
There is the composite morphism
(f *∏ f[A,B])×A→counit×id A[A,B]×A→evalB→unitf *∑ fB
  \left(f^\ast \prod_f [A, B]\right) \times A \stackrel{counit \times id_A}{\to} [A, B] \times A \stackrel{eval}{\to} B \stackrel{unit}{\to} f^\ast \sum_f B

of the adjunction (co)units and the evaluation map of the internal hom. Its hom-adjunct is
A→[f *∏ f[A,B],f *∑ fB]≅f *[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB],
  A \to [f^\ast \prod_f [A, B], f^\ast \sum_f B] \cong f^\ast [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
  \,,


using prop.  on the right. The hom-adjunct of that in turn is
∑ fA→[∏ f[A,B],∑ fB]\sum_f A \to [\prod_f [A, B], \sum_f B]
and by symmetry the morphism that we are after:
∏ f[A,B]→[∑ fA,∑ fB].
  \prod_f [A, B] \to [\sum_f A, \sum_f B]
  \,.



Remark
If YY is the terminal object (for simplicity), then the morphism of prop.  can be understood as follows: a global element of the dependent product ∏ f[A,B]\prod_f [A,B] is given by a commuting diagram in H\mathbf{H} of the form
∑ fA  →  ∑ fB  ↘  ↙   X.
  \array{
    \sum_f A &&\to&& \sum_f B
    \\
     & \searrow && \swarrow
     \\
     && X
  }
  \,.


The map in prop.  picks out the top horizontal morphism in this diagram.

For smooth spaces and smooth ∞\infty-groupoids
Consider the site C=C =  SmthMfd of smooth manifolds (and the open cover coverage) or equivalently over the dense subsite CartSp of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between these.
The sheaf topos/(∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos H=Sh(C)\mathbf{H} = Sh(C) is that of smooth spaces/smooth ∞-groupoids. So the discussion of internal homs here is a special case of the above discussion In a sheaf topos.

Example
For X,Y∈SmthMfd↪HX , Y \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} two smooth manifolds, the internal hom [X,Y]∈H[X,Y] \in \mathbf{H} is the mapping space between them regarded as a diffeological space.
See at manifold structure of mapping spaces for when this internal hom is representable again by a smooth manifold.


Example
For X∈SmthMfd↪HX \in SmthMfd \hookrightarrow \mathbf{H} the internal automorphism group, example , of XX is the diffeomorphism group of XX, regarded as a diffeological group
Aut(X)=Diff(X).
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) = \mathbf{Diff}(X)
  \,.


For chain complexes

internal hom of chain complexes

For super vector spaces
The category sVectsVect of super vector spaces is the category of ℤ/2\mathbb{Z}/2-graded vector spaces. Thus, its objects are pairs of vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-), with V +V_+ called the even part and V −V_- the odd part. The morphisms in sVectsVect are likewise pairs of linear maps, i.e. we define sVectsVect to be Vect×Vect=Vect ℤ/2Vect \times Vect = Vect^{\mathbb{Z}/2}, as usual for any sort of graded object. With this definition of the category sVectsVect, we capture the concepts of superalgebra and so on in succinct categorical terms.
Because the morphisms in sVectsVect send even things to even things and odd things to odd things, they are sometimes called even linear maps, and one may write
sVect(V,W)=EvenLin(V,W).
 sVect(V, W) = Even Lin(V,W).


Note that sVectsVect is enriched over VectVect, i.e. these hom-sets are vector spaces.
Occasionally, however, one does need to refer to the odd linear maps, which send even things to odd things and odd things to even things. That is, an odd linear map V→WV\to W is a pair of linear maps V +→W −V_+ \to W_- and V −→W +V_-\to W_+. The internal-hom in sVectsVect allows us to capture these as well: it is the following super vector space:
[V,W] +=EvenLin(V,W)[V,W] −=OddLin(V,W).
  [V,W]_+ = Even Lin(V,W) \qquad
  [V,W]_- = Odd Lin(V,W).


With this definition, sVectsVect becomes a closed monoidal category.
We can equivalently regard a super vector spaces (V +,V −)(V_+,V_-) as being the direct sum vector space V +⊕V −V_+ \oplus V_- equipped with this direct sum decomposition. If we view the internal-hom [V,W][V,W] in this way as well, then we have
[V,W]=EvenLin(V,W)⊕OddLin(V,W)=Lin(V,W).
 [V, W] = Even Lin(V,W) \oplus Odd Lin(V,W) = Lin(V,W).


In other words, any linear map between these “summed” super vector spaces decomposes uniquely as the sum of an even linear map and an odd one.
For Banach spaces
A similar thing happens in the category BanBan of Banach spaces and short linear operators. The external hom consists of only the short linear maps (those bounded by 11):
Ban(V,W)={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖≤1}. Ban(V,W) = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \leq 1 \} .
This definition of morphism recovers the most specific notion of isomorphism of Banach spaces, as well as defining the product and coproduct as the direct sum completed with p=∞p = \infty or p=1p = 1 respectively.
But the internal hom is the Banach space of all bounded linear maps:
[V,W]={f:Lin(V,W)|‖f‖<∞}. [V,W] = \{ f\colon Lin(V,W) \;|\; {\|f\|} \lt \infty \} .
This is a Banach space and makes BanBan into a closed category.
A category consists of a collection of objects together with morphisms between these objects. Thus, naively, we may think of objects as the ‘elements’ of a category.
More generally, in higher category theory the objects of an (n,r)(n,r)-category are the 00-dimensional cells of that structure, the 00-morphisms.
A natural topology on mapping spaces of continuous functions, important because of its role in exhibiting locally compact topological spaces to be exponentiable, as demonstrated below, culminating in Corollary .
The compact-open topology on the set of continuous functions X→YX \to Y is generated by the subbasis of subsets U K⊂C(X,Y)U^K \subset C(X,Y) that map a given compact subspace K⊂XK \subset X to a given open subset U⊂YU \subset Y, whence the name.
When restricting to continuous functions between compactly generated topological spaces one usually modifies this definition to a subbase of open subsets U ϕ(K)U^{\phi(K)}, where now ϕ(K)\phi(K) is the image of a compact topological space under any continuous function ϕ:K→X\phi \colon K \to X. This definition gives a cartesian internal hom in the category of compactly generated topological spaces (see also at convenient category of topological spaces).
The two definitions agree when the domain XX is a compactly generated Hausdorff space, but not in general. Beware that texts on compactly generated spaces nevertheless commonly say “compact-open topology” for the second definition.

Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We denote by Y XY^{X} the set of continuous maps from (X,𝒪 X)(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}) to (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}).


Remark
Other common notations for Y XY^{X} are Map(X,Y)Map(X,Y) or C(X,Y)C(X,Y).


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. We denote by 𝒪 X c\mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} the set of subsets of XX which are compact with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) be a topological space. Let AA be a subset of XX. We denote by A¯\overline{A} the topological closure of AA in XX with respect to 𝒪 X\mathcal{O}_{X}.


Definition
A topological space (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is locally compact if the set of compact neighbourhoods of points of XX form a neighbourhood basis of XX. That is to say: for every x∈Xx \in X and every neighbourhood NN of xx, there is a V∈𝒪 X cV \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and a U∈𝒪 XU \in \mathcal{O}_{X} such that x∈U⊂V⊂Nx \in U \subset V \subset N.


Remark
There are many variations on this definition, which can be found at locally compact space. These are all equivalent if (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff. We do not however make the assumption that (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) is Hausdorff.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. Given A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}, we denote by M A,UM_{A,U} the set of continuous maps f:X→Yf : X \rightarrow Y such that f(A)⊂Uf(A) \subset U.


Definition
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. The compact-open topology on Y XY^{X} is that with sub-basis given by the set of sets M A,UM_{A,U} such that A∈𝒪 X cA \in \mathcal{O}^{c}_{X} and U∈𝒪 YU \in \mathcal{O}_{Y}.


Notation
Let (X,𝒪 X)(X, \mathcal{O}_{X}) and (Y,𝒪 Y)(Y, \mathcal{O}_{Y}) be topological spaces. We shall denote the compact-open topology (def. ) on Y XY^{X} by 𝒪 Y X\mathcal{O}_{Y^{X}}.

An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
An nn-truncated ∞-groupoid is an n-groupoid.
An nn-truncated topological space is a homotopy n-type: all homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
An nn-truncated object in a general (∞,1)-category is an object such that all hom-∞-groupoids into it are nn-truncated.
If an object in an (∞,1)-topos_ is kk-truncated for any (possibly large) kk, then it is nn-truncated precisely if all its categorical homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
The complementary notion of nn-truncated object is that of an n-connected object of an (∞,1)-category.
In terms of truncations

Definition
(nn-truncated ∞\infty-groupoid)
An ∞-groupoid A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd is nn-truncated for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} if it is an n-groupoid:
Precisely: in the model of ∞-groupoids given by Kan complexes AA is nn-truncated if the simplicial homotopy groups π k(A,x)\pi_k(A,x) are trivial for all xx and all k>nk \gt n.

It makes sense for the following to adopt the convention that AA is called.


(−1)(-1)-truncated if it is empty or contractible – this is a (-1)-groupoid.


(−2)(-2)-truncated if it is non-empty and contractible – this is a (-2)-groupoid.


(following HTT, p. 6).
To generalize this, let now CC be an arbitrary (∞,1)-category. For X,AX,A objects in CC write C(X,A)∈C(X,A) \in  ∞Grpd for the (∞,1)-categorical hom-space (if CC is given as a simplicially enriched category then this is just the SSet-hom-object which is guaranteed to be a Kan complex).
Using this, it is useful to reformulate the above as follows slightly:


Lemma
An ∞-groupoid AA is nn-truncated precisely when for all ∞-groupoids XX the hom-


∞

\infty

-groupoid ∞Grpd(X,A)\infty Grpd(X,A) is nn-truncated.


In other category-theoretic terms this says that (∞,k)-transformation between XX and AA, whose components are k-morphisms in AA, cannot be nontrivial for k>nk \gt n if there are no nontrivial k-morphisms with k>nk \gt n in AA.
Using this fact we can transport the notion of nn-truncation to any (∞,1)-category by testing it on hom-


∞

\infty

-groupoids:

Definition
(nn-truncated object in an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category)
Given an (∞,1)-category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, an object A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C} is called nn-truncated, for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, if for all objects X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} the hom-∞-groupoid 𝒞(X,A)\mathcal{C}(X,A) is nn-truncated according to Def. .

This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.1.
Some terminology:


A 0-truncated object is also called discrete. Notice that this is categorically discrete as in discrete category, not discrete in the sense of discrete topological space. An object in an (∞,1)-topos is discrete in this sense if, regarded as an ∞-groupoid with extra structure, it has only trivial morphisms.


By the above convention on (-2)-truncated ∞\infty-groupoids, it is only the terminal objects of CC that is (-2)-truncated.


Similarly, the (-1)-truncated objects are the subterminal objects.



Definition
(nn-truncated morphism in an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category)
A morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y of ∞-groupoids is nn-truncated if all of its homotopy fibers are nn-truncated by def. .
A morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y in an (∞,1)-category CC is nn-truncated if for all W∈CW \in C the postcomposition morphism
C(W,f):C(W,X)→C(W,Y)
  C(W,f) : C(W,X) \to C(W,Y)


is nn-truncated in ∞Grpd.

This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.8.
By the characterization of homotopy fiber of functor categories this is equivalent to saying that ff is kk-truncated when it is so regarded as an object of the over (∞,1)-category C /YC_{/Y}. (See also HTT, rem. 5.5.6.12.)
Unwinding the definitions and applying the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, we have:

Proposition
For n≥−1n \geq -1, a morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y of ∞-groupoids is nn-truncated iff, for every point x∈Xx \in X, we have π n+1(X,x)→π n+1(Y,f(x))\pi_{n+1}(X, x) \to \pi_{n+1}(Y, f(x)) is a monomorphism and for every k≥n+2k \geq n+2, π k(X,x)→π k(Y,f(x))\pi_k(X, x) \to \pi_k(Y, f(x)) is an isomorphism.
ff is (−2)(-2)-trunacated iff it is a weak homotopy equivalence.

In terms of categorical homotopy groups
At least if the ambient (∞,1)-category is even an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos there is an alternative, more intrinsic, characterization of nn-truncation in terms of categorical homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos:

Proposition
Suppose that an object XX in an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos is kk-truncated for some k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} (possibly very large).
Then for any n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} this XX is nn-truncated precisely if all the categorical homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.


Proof
This is HTT, prop 6.5.1.7.


Remark
Notice that this expected statement does require the assumption that XX is kk-truncated for some kk. Without any a priori truncation assumption on XX, there is no comparable statement about the relation to categorical homotopy groups. See HTT, remark 6.5.1.8.

Recursive definition

Proposition
In an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category CC with finite limits, a morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y is kk-truncated (for k≥−1k \geq -1) precisely if the diagonal morphism X→X× YXX \to X \times_Y X is (k−1)(k-1)-truncated.

This is HTT, lemma 5.5.6.15.

Proof
By definition ff is kk-truncated if for each object d∈Cd \in C we have that C(d,f)C(d,f) is kk-truncated in ∞Grpd. Since the hom-functors C(d,−)C(d,-) preserve (∞,1)-limits, we have in particular that X→X× YXX \to X \times_Y X in CC is kk-truncated if C(d,X)→C(d,X)× C(d,Y)C(d,X)C(d,X) \to C(d,X) \times_{C(d,Y)} C(d,X) is kk-truncated for all dd in ∞Grpd. Therefore it is sufficient to prove the statement for morphisms in C=C = ∞Grpd.
So let now f:X→Yf : X \to Y be a morphism of ∞-groupoids. We may find a fibration ϕ¯:X¯→Y¯\bar \phi : \bar X \to \bar Y between Kan complexes in sSet that models f:X→Yf : X \to Y in the standard model structure on simplicial sets, and by the standard rules for homotopy pullbacks it follows that the object X× YXX \times_Y X in ∞\infty-Grpd is then modeled by the ordinary pullback X¯× Y¯X¯\bar X \times_{\bar Y} \bar X in sSet. And the homotopy fibers of ff over y∈Yy \in Y are then given by the ordinary fibers X¯ y\bar X_y of f¯\bar f in sSetsSet.
This way, the statement is reduced to the following fact: a Kan complex X¯ y\bar X_y is kk-truncated precisely if the homotopy fibers of X¯ y→X¯ y×X¯ y\bar X_y \to \bar X_y \times \bar X_y are (k−1)(k-1)-truncated.
We now write XX for X¯ y\bar X_y for simplicity. To see the last statement, let (a,b):*→X×X(a,b) : * \to X \times X and compute the homotopy pullback
Q → * ↓  ↓ (a,b) X → X×X
  \array{
     Q &\to& *
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(a,b)}}
     \\
     X &\to& X \times X
  }


as usual by replacing the right vertical morphism with the fibration (X×X) I× X×X(a,b)→X×X(X \times X)^I \times_{X \times X} (a,b) \to X \times X and then forming the ordinary pullback. This shows that QQ is equivalent to the space of paths P a,bXP_{a,b}X in XX from aa to bb. (Use that gluing of path space objects at endpoints of paths produces a new path space; see, for instance, section 4 of BrownAHT).
If XX is connected, then choosing any path a→ba \to b gives an isomorphism from the homotopy groups of P a,bXP_{a,b} X to those of the loop space Ω aX\Omega_a X. These latter are indeed those of XX, shifted down in degree by one (as described, for instance, at fiber sequence).
If XX is not connected, we can easily reduce to the case that it is.

For CC an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category and k≥−2k \geq -2, the full sub-(∞,1)-category τ ≤kC\tau_{\leq k} C is stable under all

This is HTT, prop. 5.5.6.5.

Proposition
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos. For all (−2)≤n≤∞(-2) \leq n \leq \infty the class of nn-truncated morphisms in H\mathbf{H} forms the right class in a orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category. The left class is that of n-connected morphisms in H\mathbf{H}.

This appears as a remark in HTT, Example 5.2.8.16. A construction of the factorization in terms of a model category presentation is in (Rezk, prop. 8.5). See also n-connected/n-truncated factorization system.
Model category presentations
There are model structures for homotopy n-types that presentable (∞,1)-category present the full sub-(∞,1)-categories of nn-truncated objects in some ambient (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category. See there for more details.
Truncated morphisms
General
A morphism f:X→0f : X \to 0 is


(-2)-truncated precisely if it is an equivalence;


(-1)-truncated precisely if it is a monomorphism.


Between groupoids
For morphisms between 1-groupoids, the notion of nn-truncation for low nn reproduces standard concepts from ordinary category theory.

Proposition
A functor f:X→Yf : X \to Y between groupoids, is nn-truncated precisely when regarded as a morphism in ∞Grpd it is


for n=−2n = -2 – an equivalence of categories;


for n=−1n = -1  – a full and faithful functor;


for n=0n = 0 – a faithful functor.




Proof
Notice that ff being faithful means precisely that it induces a monomorphism on the first homotopy groups.
For x:*→Xx : * \to X any point and F f(x)F_{f(x)} the corresponding homotopy fiber of ff, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups gives that π 1(F)\pi_1(F) is the kernel of an injective map
⋯→π 1(F)→π 1(X)↪π 1(Y,f(x))→⋯,
  \cdots \to \pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(X) \hookrightarrow \pi_1(Y,f(x)) \to \cdots
  \,,


hence π 1(F y)=*\pi_1(F_{y}) = * for all points yy in the essential image of ff. For yy not in the essential image we have F y≃∅F_y \simeq \emptyset. In either case, it follows that FF is 0-truncated.
By def.  this is the defining condition for ff to be 0-truncated.

Between stacks
Let CC be a site and write Sh (2,1)(C)↪Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(2,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) for the (2,1)-topos of stacks/(2,1)-sheaves inside the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos of all ∞-stacks/(∞,1)-sheaves.
Write L W[C op,Grpd]L_W [C^{op}, Grpd] for the simplicial localization of groupoid valued presheaves in CC and write [C op,sSet] proj,loc[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc} for the local projective model structure on simplicial presheaves that presents Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C).

Proposition
Let f:X→Yf : X \to Y be a morphism of stacks that has a presentation by a degreewise faithful functor that, under the nerve, goes between fibrant simplicial presheaves.
Then ff is 0-truncated as a morphism in Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C).


Proof
We need to check that for any ∞\infty-stack AA, the morphism Sh ∞(A,f)Sh_\infty(A,f) is 0-truncated in ∞Grpd. We may choose a cofibrant model for AA in [C op,sSet] proj,loc[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc} and by assumption that XX and YY is fibrant we have that the ordinary hom of simplicial presheaves [C op,sSet](A,f)[C^{op}, sSet](A, f)  is the correct derived hom space morphism. This is itself (the nerve of) a faithful functor, hence the statement follows with prop. .

In ∞Grpd\infty Grpd and in TopTop
An object in ∞Grpd is nn-truncated precisely if it is an n-groupoid. To some extent, this is so by definition. Equivalently, an object in Top is nn-truncated if it is (in the equivalence class of) a homotopy n-type.
So we have for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} a reflective sub-(∞,1)-category
nGrpd↪←τ ≤n∞Grpd.
  n Grpd \stackrel{\overset{\tau_{\leq n}}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.



Observation
If we model the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd as the Kan complex-enriched category/fibrant simplicial category KanCplx⊂KanCplx \subset  sSet of Kan complexes, then the truncation adjunction
(τ ≤n⊣i):nGrpd↪←τ ≤n∞Grpd.
  (\tau_{\leq n } \dashv i)
  :
  n Grpd \stackrel{\overset{\tau_{\leq n}}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


is modeled by the simplicial coskeleton sSet-enriched adjunction
(tr n+1⊣cosk n+1):KanCplx n+1→cosk n+1←tr n+1KanCplx,
  (tr_{n+1} \dashv cosk_{n+1})
  :
  KanCplx_{n+1} \stackrel{\overset{tr_{n+1}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{cosk_{n+1}}{\to}}
  KanCplx
  \,,


where KanCplx n+1KanCplx_{n+1} is the subcategory of [Δ ≤n+1 op,Set][\Delta^{op}_{\leq n+1}, Set] on those truncated simplicial sets that are truncations of Kan complexes, regarded as a Kan-complex-enriched category by the embedding via cosk n+1cosk_{n+1}.


Proof
Notice that every Kan complex XX which is nn-truncated is homotopy equivalent to one in the image of cosk n+1cosk_{n+1}, namely to cosk n+1tr n+1Xcosk_{n+1} tr_{n+1} X, because by one of the properties of cosk n+1cosk_{n+1} we have that the unit
X→cosk n+1tr n+1X
  X \to cosk_{n+1} tr_{n+1} X


induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups π k\pi_k for k≤nk \leq n.
This shows that KanCplx n+1KanCplx_{n+1} is indeed a full sub-(∞,1)-category of KanCplxKanCplx on nn-truncated objects
Moreover, by the fact discussed at Simplicial and derived adjunctions at adjoint (∞,1)-functor we have that the sSet-enriched adjunction (tr n+1⊣cosk n+1)(tr_{n+1} \dashv cosk_{n+1}) on KanCplxKanCplx indeed presents a pair of adjoint (∞,1)-functors on ∞Grpd. So tr n+1:KanCplx→KanCplxtr_{n+1} : KanCplx \to KanCplx indeed presents the left adjoint τ ≤:∞Grpd→nGrpd\tau_{\leq} : \infty Grpd \to n Grpd to the inclusion nGrpd↪∞Grpdn Grpd \hookrightarrow \infty Grpd.

Diagonals

Example
In ordinary category theory we have that a morphism is a monomorphism (as discussed there), precisely if its diagonal is an isomorphism. Embedded into (∞,1)-category, this becomes the special case of prop.  for n=0n = 0: a morphism is (-1)-truncated (hence a monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category), precisely if its diagonal is (-2)-truncated (hence an equivalence in an (∞,1)-category).


Example
Let XX be an object that is nn-truncated. This means that X→*X \to * is an nn-truncated morphism. So by prop.  the diagonal on that object
Δ:X→X×X
  \Delta : X \to X \times X


is an (n−1)(n-1)-truncated morphism, and precisely if it is (n−1)(n-1)-truncated is XX nn-truncated.
In particular, the diagonal is a monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category, hence (-1)-truncated, precisely if XX is 00-truncated (an h-set).

The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


An equivalence class is an element of a quotient set.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.

There is a lot of interesting stuff to be said about equality in logic, higher category theory, and the foundations of mathematics, but it hasn't all been said here yet.
In general two objects are considered equivalent if they may be replaced by one another in all contexts under consideration (see also the principle of equivalence).
At the propositional level, the general theory of equivalence is discussed at equivalence relation, but that leaves us with the question of the correct definition of equivalence in various situations. Furthermore, we can work on a higher level and ask what the equivalences are, not just whether things are equivalent.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.

Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.

The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.

In general two objects are considered equivalent if they may be replaced by one another in all contexts under consideration (see also the principle of equivalence).
At the propositional level, the general theory of equivalence is discussed at equivalence relation, but that leaves us with the question of the correct definition of equivalence in various situations. Furthermore, we can work on a higher level and ask what the equivalences are, not just whether things are equivalent.
In SU(n)SU(n)-Yang-Mills theory an instanton is a field configuration with non-vanishing second Chern class that minimizes the Yang-Mills energy.
Let (X,g)(X,g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension 4. Let GG be a compact Lie group.
A field configuration of GG-Yang-Mills theory on (X,g)(X,g) is a GG-principal bundle P→XP \to X with connection ∇\nabla.
For G=SU(n)G = SU(n) the special unitary group, there is canonically an associated complex vector bundle E=P× Gℂ nE = P \times_G \mathbb{C}^n.
Write F ∇∈Ω 2(X,End(E))F_\nabla \in \Omega^2(X,End(E)) for the curvature 2-form of ∇\nabla.
One says that ∇\nabla is an instanton configuration if F ∇F_\nabla is Hodge-self dual
⋆F ∇=F ∇,
  \star F_\nabla =  F_\nabla
  \,,


where ⋆:Ω k(X)→Ω 4−k(X)\star : \Omega^k(X) \to \Omega^{4-k}(X) is the Hodge star operator induced by the Riemannian metric gg.
The second Chern class of PP, which by the Chern-Weil homomorphism is given by
c 2(E)=∫ XTr(F ∇∧F ∇)=k∈H 4(X,ℤ)
 c_2(E) = \int_X Tr(F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla)
  =
  k
  \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})


is called the instanton number or the instanton sector of ∇\nabla.
Notice that therefore any connection, even if not self-dual, is in some instanton sector, as its underlying bundle has some second Chern class, meaning that it can be obtained from shifting a self-dual connection. The self-dual connections are a convenient choice of “base point” in each instanton sector.
As gradient flows between flat connections.
We discuss how Yang-Mills instantons may be understood as trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons theory action functional.
Let (Σ,g Σ)(\Sigma,g_\Sigma) be a compact 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold .
Let the cartesian product
X=Σ×ℝ
  X = \Sigma \times \mathbb{R}


of Σ\Sigma with the real line be equipped with the product metric of gg with the canonical metric on ℝ\mathbb{R}.
Consider field configurations ∇\nabla of Yang-Mills theory over Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} with finite Yang-Mills action
S YM(∇)=∫ Σ×ℝF ∇∧⋆F ∇<∞.
  S_{YM}(\nabla) = \int_{\Sigma \times \mathbb{R}} F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla
  \,\,\lt  \infty
  \,.


These must be such that there is t 1<t 2∈ℝt_1 \lt t_2 \in \mathbb{R} such that F ∇(t<t 1)=0F_\nabla(t \lt t_1) = 0 and F ∇(T>t 2)=0F_\nabla(T \gt t_2) = 0, hence these must be solutions interpolating between two flat connections ∇ t 1\nabla_{t_1} and ∇ t 2\nabla_{t_2}.
For A∈Ω 1(U×ℝ,𝔤)A \in \Omega^1(U\times \mathbb{R}, \mathfrak{g}) the Lie algebra valued 1-form corresponding to ∇\nabla, we can always find a gauge transformation such that A ∂ t=0A_{\partial_t} = 0 (“temporal gauge”). In this gauge we may hence equivalently think of AA as a 1-parameter family
t↦A(t)∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)
  t \mapsto A(t) \in \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})


of connections on Σ\Sigma. Then the self-duality condition on a Yang-Mills instanton
F ∇=−⋆F ∇
  F_\nabla = - \star F_\nabla


reads equivalently
ddtA=−⋆ gF A∈Ω 1(Σ,𝔤).
  \frac{d}{d t} A = -\star_{g} F_A
  \,\,\,
  \in 
  \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g})
  \,.



Definition
On the linear configuration space Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) of Lie algebra valued forms on Σ\Sigma define the Hodge inner product metric
G(α,β):=∫ Σ⟨α∧⋆ gβ⟩,
  G(\alpha, \beta) := \int_{\Sigma} \langle \alpha \wedge \star_g \beta \rangle
  \,,


where ⟨−,−⟩:𝔤⊗𝔤→ℝ\langle-,-\rangle : \mathfrak{g} \otimes \mathfrak{g} \to \mathbb{R} is the Killing form invariant polynomial on the Lie algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.


Proposition
The instanton equation
ddtA=−⋆ gF A
  \frac{d}{d t} A = 
  -\star_{g} F_A


is the equation characterizing trajectories of the gradient flow of the Chern-Simons action functional
S CS:Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)→ℝ
  S_{CS} : \Omega^1(\Sigma, \mathfrak{g}) \to \mathbb{R}

A↦∫ ΣCS(A)
  A \mapsto \int_\Sigma CS(A)


with respect to the Hodge inner product metric on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}).


Proof
The variation of the Chern-Simons action is
δS CS(A)=∫ Σ⟨δA∧F A⟩
  \delta S_{CS}(A) = \int_\Sigma \langle \delta A \wedge F_A\rangle


(see Chern-Simons theory for details).
In other words, we have the 1-form on Ω 1(Σ,𝔤)\Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}):
δS CS(−) A=∫ Σ⟨−∧F A⟩.
  \delta S_{CS}(-)_A
  = 
  \int_\Sigma \langle - \wedge F_A \rangle
  \,.


The corresponding gradient vector field
∇S CS:=G −1δS CS
  \nabla S_{CS}
   :=
  G^{-1} \delta S_{CS}


is uniquely defined by the equation
δS CS(−) =G(−,∇S CS) ∫ Σ⟨−,⋆∇S CS⟩.
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta S_{CS}(-) 
     & = G(-,\nabla S_{CS})
    \\
    \int_\Sigma \langle - , \star \nabla S_{CS}\rangle
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


With the formula (see Hodge star operator)
⋆⋆A=(−1) 1(3+1)A=A
  \star \star A = (-1)^{1(3+1)} A = A


we find therefore
∇S CS=⋆ gF A.
  \nabla S_{CS} = \star_g F_A
  \,.


Hence the gradient flow equation
ddtA+∇S CSA=0
  \frac{d}{d t} A + \nabla S_{CS}_A = 0


is indeed
ddtA=−⋆ gF A.
  \frac{d}{d t} A =  - \star_g F_A
  \,.


Since flat connections are the critical loci of S CSS_{CS} this says that a finite-action Yang-Mills instanton on Σ×ℝ\Sigma \times \mathbb{R} is a gradient flow trajectory between two Chern-Simons theory vacua .
Often this is interpreted as saying that “a Yang-Mills instanton describes the tunneling between two Chern-Simons theory vacua”.
As Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states
Due to the higher WZW term ∝∫ D p+4C p+1∧⟨F∧F⟩\propto \int_{D_{p+4}} C_{p+1} \wedge \langle F \wedge F \rangle in the Green-Schwarz sigma model for D(p+4)-branes, Yang-Mills instantons in the Chan-Paton gauge field on D(p+4)D (p+4)-branes are equivalently Dp-D(p+4)-brane bound states (see e.g. Polchinski 96, 5.4, Tong 05, 1.4).
The lift to M-theory as M5-MO9 brane bound states is due to Strominger 90, Witten 96.

In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)
Dependent type theory is the flavor of type theory that admits dependent types.
Its categorical semantics is in locally cartesian closed categories CC, where a dependent type
x:X⊢E(x)type
  x : X \vdash E(x) \; \mathrm{type}


is interpreted as a morphism E→XE \to X, hence an object in the slice category C /XC_{/X}.
Then change of context corresponds to base change in CC. See also dependent sum and dependent product.
Dependent type systems are heavily used for software certification.
They also seem to support a foundations of mathematics in terms of homotopy type theory.

This (Seely, theorem 6.3). It is somewhat more complicated than this, because we need to strictify the category theory to match the category theory; see categorical model of dependent types. For a more detailed discussion see at relation between type theory and category theory.
Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
In any predicate logic over type theory, propositional equality is the notion of equality which is defined to be a proposition. Propositional equality is most commonly used in set theories like ZFC and ETCS, but it could also be used for definitional equality and conversional equality in some presentations of dependent type theories like Martin-Löf type theory or cubical type theory in place of judgmental equality.
Propositional equality can be contrasted with judgmental equality, where equality is a judgment, and typal equality, where equality is a type.
Note on terminology
Historically in the dependent type theory community, the term propositional equality was used for typal equality. This was because under the principle of propositions as types, one interprets all types in a single-layer type theory as being propositions. However, we choose to make a distinction between propositional equality and typal equality. First, propositional equality as defined in this article is used in the most common foundations of mathematics, such as ZFC and ETCS, and is clearly not a type. Additionally, in some logics over type theory, one can have three distinct notions of equality: judgmental equality, propositional equality, and typal equality. Finally, in the advent of homotopy type theory and other type theoretic higher foundations, typal equality is no longer required to be a subsingleton or h-proposition, and the alternative principle of propositions as some types has become the primary interpretation of dependent type theory, where only the subsingletons or h-propositions are interpreted as propositions.
In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
Dependent type theory is the flavor of type theory that admits dependent types.
Its categorical semantics is in locally cartesian closed categories CC, where a dependent type
x:X⊢E(x)type
  x : X \vdash E(x) \; \mathrm{type}


is interpreted as a morphism E→XE \to X, hence an object in the slice category C /XC_{/X}.

In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Semantics is the interpretation of the syntax of a theory in a model.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.

The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.


The mapping cocone of a morphism f:A→Cf : A \to C, with CC a pointed object, is a particular model category realization of the homotopy fiber of ff, i.e. of the homotopy pullback
Cocone(f) → A ↓  ↓ f * → C
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


of the point along ff.
The concept is dual to that of mapping cone.
Mapping co-cones are realized in terms of mapping cocylinders, as described below. These typically play the role of generalized universal bundles.
Under sufficiently nice conditions (…spell out…), the homotopy pullback
Cocone(f) → A ↓  ↓ f * → C
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


may be computed as the ordinary limit over the diagram
    A     ↓ f   C I → C   ↓ * → C,
  \array{
    && && A
    \\
    &&&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }
  \,,


where C IC^I is a path space object of CC. This, in turn, may be computed as two consecutive ordinary pullbacks. The first one
  E fC → A   ↓  ↓ f   C I → C   ↓ * → C
  \array{
    && \mathbf{E}_f C &\to& A
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


yields the mapping cocylinder E fC\mathbf{E}_f C. This is the kind of object discussed at generalized universal bundle. The second pullback then produces the mapping cocone
Cocone(f) → E fC → A ↓  ↓  ↓ f   C I → C ↓  ↓ * → C.
  \array{
    Cocone(f)  &\to& \mathbf{E}_f C &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
     &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }
  \,.


A category consists of a collection of objects together with morphisms between these objects. Thus, naively, we may think of objects as the ‘elements’ of a category.
More generally, in higher category theory the objects of an (n,r)(n,r)-category are the 00-dimensional cells of that structure, the 00-morphisms.
A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}

  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
The mapping cocone of a morphism f:A→Cf : A \to C, with CC a pointed object, is a particular model category realization of the homotopy fiber of ff, i.e. of the homotopy pullback

of the point along ff.
The concept is dual to that of mapping cone.

    &&C^I &\to& C

where C IC^I is a path space object of CC. This, in turn, may be computed as two consecutive ordinary pullbacks. The first one

    \\
    &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\

yields the mapping cocylinder E fC\mathbf{E}_f C. This is the kind of object discussed at generalized universal bundle. The second pullback then produces the mapping cocone

An nn-truncated ∞-groupoid is an n-groupoid.
An nn-truncated topological space is a homotopy n-type: all homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
An nn-truncated object in a general (∞,1)-category is an object such that all hom-∞-groupoids into it are nn-truncated.
If an object in an (∞,1)-topos_ is kk-truncated for any (possibly large) kk, then it is nn-truncated precisely if all its categorical homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
The complementary notion of nn-truncated object is that of an n-connected object of an (∞,1)-category.
In terms of truncations

Definition
(nn-truncated ∞\infty-groupoid)
An ∞-groupoid A∈∞GrpdA \in \infty Grpd is nn-truncated for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} if it is an n-groupoid:
Precisely: in the model of ∞-groupoids given by Kan complexes AA is nn-truncated if the simplicial homotopy groups π k(A,x)\pi_k(A,x) are trivial for all xx and all k>nk \gt n.

It makes sense for the following to adopt the convention that AA is called.


(−1)(-1)-truncated if it is empty or contractible – this is a (-1)-groupoid.


(−2)(-2)-truncated if it is non-empty and contractible – this is a (-2)-groupoid.


(following HTT, p. 6).
To generalize this, let now CC be an arbitrary (∞,1)-category. For X,AX,A objects in CC write C(X,A)∈C(X,A) \in  ∞Grpd for the (∞,1)-categorical hom-space (if CC is given as a simplicially enriched category then this is just the SSet-hom-object which is guaranteed to be a Kan complex).
Using this, it is useful to reformulate the above as follows slightly:


Lemma
An ∞-groupoid AA is nn-truncated precisely when for all ∞-groupoids XX the hom-


∞

\infty

-groupoid ∞Grpd(X,A)\infty Grpd(X,A) is nn-truncated.


In other category-theoretic terms this says that (∞,k)-transformation between XX and AA, whose components are k-morphisms in AA, cannot be nontrivial for k>nk \gt n if there are no nontrivial k-morphisms with k>nk \gt n in AA.
Using this fact we can transport the notion of nn-truncation to any (∞,1)-category by testing it on hom-


∞

\infty

-groupoids:

Definition
(nn-truncated object in an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category)
Given an (∞,1)-category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, an object A∈𝒞A \in \mathcal{C} is called nn-truncated, for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N}, if for all objects X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} the hom-∞-groupoid 𝒞(X,A)\mathcal{C}(X,A) is nn-truncated according to Def. .

This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.1.
Some terminology:


A 0-truncated object is also called discrete. Notice that this is categorically discrete as in discrete category, not discrete in the sense of discrete topological space. An object in an (∞,1)-topos is discrete in this sense if, regarded as an ∞-groupoid with extra structure, it has only trivial morphisms.


By the above convention on (-2)-truncated ∞\infty-groupoids, it is only the terminal objects of CC that is (-2)-truncated.


Similarly, the (-1)-truncated objects are the subterminal objects.



Definition
(nn-truncated morphism in an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category)
A morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y of ∞-groupoids is nn-truncated if all of its homotopy fibers are nn-truncated by def. .
A morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y in an (∞,1)-category CC is nn-truncated if for all W∈CW \in C the postcomposition morphism
C(W,f):C(W,X)→C(W,Y)
  C(W,f) : C(W,X) \to C(W,Y)


is nn-truncated in ∞Grpd.

This is HTT, def. 5.5.6.8.
By the characterization of homotopy fiber of functor categories this is equivalent to saying that ff is kk-truncated when it is so regarded as an object of the over (∞,1)-category C /YC_{/Y}. (See also HTT, rem. 5.5.6.12.)
Unwinding the definitions and applying the long exact sequence of homotopy groups, we have:

Proposition
For n≥−1n \geq -1, a morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y of ∞-groupoids is nn-truncated iff, for every point x∈Xx \in X, we have π n+1(X,x)→π n+1(Y,f(x))\pi_{n+1}(X, x) \to \pi_{n+1}(Y, f(x)) is a monomorphism and for every k≥n+2k \geq n+2, π k(X,x)→π k(Y,f(x))\pi_k(X, x) \to \pi_k(Y, f(x)) is an isomorphism.
ff is (−2)(-2)-trunacated iff it is a weak homotopy equivalence.

In terms of categorical homotopy groups
At least if the ambient (∞,1)-category is even an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos there is an alternative, more intrinsic, characterization of nn-truncation in terms of categorical homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos:

Proposition
Suppose that an object XX in an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos is kk-truncated for some k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} (possibly very large).
Then for any n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} this XX is nn-truncated precisely if all the categorical homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.


Proof
This is HTT, prop 6.5.1.7.


Remark
Notice that this expected statement does require the assumption that XX is kk-truncated for some kk. Without any a priori truncation assumption on XX, there is no comparable statement about the relation to categorical homotopy groups. See HTT, remark 6.5.1.8.

Recursive definition

Proposition
In an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category CC with finite limits, a morphism f:X→Yf : X \to Y is kk-truncated (for k≥−1k \geq -1) precisely if the diagonal morphism X→X× YXX \to X \times_Y X is (k−1)(k-1)-truncated.

This is HTT, lemma 5.5.6.15.

Proof
By definition ff is kk-truncated if for each object d∈Cd \in C we have that C(d,f)C(d,f) is kk-truncated in ∞Grpd. Since the hom-functors C(d,−)C(d,-) preserve (∞,1)-limits, we have in particular that X→X× YXX \to X \times_Y X in CC is kk-truncated if C(d,X)→C(d,X)× C(d,Y)C(d,X)C(d,X) \to C(d,X) \times_{C(d,Y)} C(d,X) is kk-truncated for all dd in ∞Grpd. Therefore it is sufficient to prove the statement for morphisms in C=C = ∞Grpd.
So let now f:X→Yf : X \to Y be a morphism of ∞-groupoids. We may find a fibration ϕ¯:X¯→Y¯\bar \phi : \bar X \to \bar Y between Kan complexes in sSet that models f:X→Yf : X \to Y in the standard model structure on simplicial sets, and by the standard rules for homotopy pullbacks it follows that the object X× YXX \times_Y X in ∞\infty-Grpd is then modeled by the ordinary pullback X¯× Y¯X¯\bar X \times_{\bar Y} \bar X in sSet. And the homotopy fibers of ff over y∈Yy \in Y are then given by the ordinary fibers X¯ y\bar X_y of f¯\bar f in sSetsSet.
This way, the statement is reduced to the following fact: a Kan complex X¯ y\bar X_y is kk-truncated precisely if the homotopy fibers of X¯ y→X¯ y×X¯ y\bar X_y \to \bar X_y \times \bar X_y are (k−1)(k-1)-truncated.
We now write XX for X¯ y\bar X_y for simplicity. To see the last statement, let (a,b):*→X×X(a,b) : * \to X \times X and compute the homotopy pullback
Q → * ↓  ↓ (a,b) X → X×X
  \array{
     Q &\to& *
     \\
     \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(a,b)}}
     \\
     X &\to& X \times X
  }


as usual by replacing the right vertical morphism with the fibration (X×X) I× X×X(a,b)→X×X(X \times X)^I \times_{X \times X} (a,b) \to X \times X and then forming the ordinary pullback. This shows that QQ is equivalent to the space of paths P a,bXP_{a,b}X in XX from aa to bb. (Use that gluing of path space objects at endpoints of paths produces a new path space; see, for instance, section 4 of BrownAHT).
If XX is connected, then choosing any path a→ba \to b gives an isomorphism from the homotopy groups of P a,bXP_{a,b} X to those of the loop space Ω aX\Omega_a X. These latter are indeed those of XX, shifted down in degree by one (as described, for instance, at fiber sequence).
If XX is not connected, we can easily reduce to the case that it is.

This is HTT, prop. 5.5.6.5.

Proposition
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos. For all (−2)≤n≤∞(-2) \leq n \leq \infty the class of nn-truncated morphisms in H\mathbf{H} forms the right class in a orthogonal factorization system in an (∞,1)-category. The left class is that of n-connected morphisms in H\mathbf{H}.

This appears as a remark in HTT, Example 5.2.8.16. A construction of the factorization in terms of a model category presentation is in (Rezk, prop. 8.5). See also n-connected/n-truncated factorization system.
Model category presentations
There are model structures for homotopy n-types that presentable (∞,1)-category present the full sub-(∞,1)-categories of nn-truncated objects in some ambient (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category. See there for more details.
Truncated morphisms
General
A morphism f:X→0f : X \to 0 is


(-2)-truncated precisely if it is an equivalence;


(-1)-truncated precisely if it is a monomorphism.


Between groupoids
For morphisms between 1-groupoids, the notion of nn-truncation for low nn reproduces standard concepts from ordinary category theory.

Proposition
A functor f:X→Yf : X \to Y between groupoids, is nn-truncated precisely when regarded as a morphism in ∞Grpd it is


for n=−2n = -2 – an equivalence of categories;


for n=−1n = -1  – a full and faithful functor;


for n=0n = 0 – a faithful functor.




Proof
Notice that ff being faithful means precisely that it induces a monomorphism on the first homotopy groups.
For x:*→Xx : * \to X any point and F f(x)F_{f(x)} the corresponding homotopy fiber of ff, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups gives that π 1(F)\pi_1(F) is the kernel of an injective map
⋯→π 1(F)→π 1(X)↪π 1(Y,f(x))→⋯,
  \cdots \to \pi_1(F) \to \pi_1(X) \hookrightarrow \pi_1(Y,f(x)) \to \cdots
  \,,


hence π 1(F y)=*\pi_1(F_{y}) = * for all points yy in the essential image of ff. For yy not in the essential image we have F y≃∅F_y \simeq \emptyset. In either case, it follows that FF is 0-truncated.
By def.  this is the defining condition for ff to be 0-truncated.

Between stacks
Let CC be a site and write Sh (2,1)(C)↪Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(2,1)}(C) \hookrightarrow Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C) for the (2,1)-topos of stacks/(2,1)-sheaves inside the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos of all ∞-stacks/(∞,1)-sheaves.
Write L W[C op,Grpd]L_W [C^{op}, Grpd] for the simplicial localization of groupoid valued presheaves in CC and write [C op,sSet] proj,loc[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc} for the local projective model structure on simplicial presheaves that presents Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C).

Proposition
Let f:X→Yf : X \to Y be a morphism of stacks that has a presentation by a degreewise faithful functor that, under the nerve, goes between fibrant simplicial presheaves.
Then ff is 0-truncated as a morphism in Sh (∞,1)(C)Sh_{(\infty,1)}(C).


Proof
We need to check that for any ∞\infty-stack AA, the morphism Sh ∞(A,f)Sh_\infty(A,f) is 0-truncated in ∞Grpd. We may choose a cofibrant model for AA in [C op,sSet] proj,loc[C^{op}, sSet]_{proj,loc} and by assumption that XX and YY is fibrant we have that the ordinary hom of simplicial presheaves [C op,sSet](A,f)[C^{op}, sSet](A, f)  is the correct derived hom space morphism. This is itself (the nerve of) a faithful functor, hence the statement follows with prop. .

In ∞Grpd\infty Grpd and in TopTop
An object in ∞Grpd is nn-truncated precisely if it is an n-groupoid. To some extent, this is so by definition. Equivalently, an object in Top is nn-truncated if it is (in the equivalence class of) a homotopy n-type.
So we have for n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} a reflective sub-(∞,1)-category
nGrpd↪←τ ≤n∞Grpd.
  n Grpd \stackrel{\overset{\tau_{\leq n}}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.



Observation
If we model the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd as the Kan complex-enriched category/fibrant simplicial category KanCplx⊂KanCplx \subset  sSet of Kan complexes, then the truncation adjunction
(τ ≤n⊣i):nGrpd↪←τ ≤n∞Grpd.
  (\tau_{\leq n } \dashv i)
  :
  n Grpd \stackrel{\overset{\tau_{\leq n}}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  \infty Grpd
  \,.


is modeled by the simplicial coskeleton sSet-enriched adjunction
(tr n+1⊣cosk n+1):KanCplx n+1→cosk n+1←tr n+1KanCplx,
  (tr_{n+1} \dashv cosk_{n+1})
  :
  KanCplx_{n+1} \stackrel{\overset{tr_{n+1}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{cosk_{n+1}}{\to}}
  KanCplx
  \,,


where KanCplx n+1KanCplx_{n+1} is the subcategory of [Δ ≤n+1 op,Set][\Delta^{op}_{\leq n+1}, Set] on those truncated simplicial sets that are truncations of Kan complexes, regarded as a Kan-complex-enriched category by the embedding via cosk n+1cosk_{n+1}.


Proof
Notice that every Kan complex XX which is nn-truncated is homotopy equivalent to one in the image of cosk n+1cosk_{n+1}, namely to cosk n+1tr n+1Xcosk_{n+1} tr_{n+1} X, because by one of the properties of cosk n+1cosk_{n+1} we have that the unit
X→cosk n+1tr n+1X
  X \to cosk_{n+1} tr_{n+1} X


induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups π k\pi_k for k≤nk \leq n.
This shows that KanCplx n+1KanCplx_{n+1} is indeed a full sub-(∞,1)-category of KanCplxKanCplx on nn-truncated objects
Moreover, by the fact discussed at Simplicial and derived adjunctions at adjoint (∞,1)-functor we have that the sSet-enriched adjunction (tr n+1⊣cosk n+1)(tr_{n+1} \dashv cosk_{n+1}) on KanCplxKanCplx indeed presents a pair of adjoint (∞,1)-functors on ∞Grpd. So tr n+1:KanCplx→KanCplxtr_{n+1} : KanCplx \to KanCplx indeed presents the left adjoint τ ≤:∞Grpd→nGrpd\tau_{\leq} : \infty Grpd \to n Grpd to the inclusion nGrpd↪∞Grpdn Grpd \hookrightarrow \infty Grpd.

Diagonals

Example
In ordinary category theory we have that a morphism is a monomorphism (as discussed there), precisely if its diagonal is an isomorphism. Embedded into (∞,1)-category, this becomes the special case of prop.  for n=0n = 0: a morphism is (-1)-truncated (hence a monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category), precisely if its diagonal is (-2)-truncated (hence an equivalence in an (∞,1)-category).


Example
Let XX be an object that is nn-truncated. This means that X→*X \to * is an nn-truncated morphism. So by prop.  the diagonal on that object
Δ:X→X×X
  \Delta : X \to X \times X


is an (n−1)(n-1)-truncated morphism, and precisely if it is (n−1)(n-1)-truncated is XX nn-truncated.
In particular, the diagonal is a monomorphism in an (∞,1)-category, hence (-1)-truncated, precisely if XX is 00-truncated (an h-set).

The mapping cocone of a morphism f:A→Cf : A \to C, with CC a pointed object, is a particular model category realization of the homotopy fiber of ff, i.e. of the homotopy pullback
Cocone(f) → A ↓  ↓ f * → C
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


of the point along ff.
The concept is dual to that of mapping cone.
Mapping co-cones are realized in terms of mapping cocylinders, as described below. These typically play the role of generalized universal bundles.
Under sufficiently nice conditions (…spell out…), the homotopy pullback
Cocone(f) → A ↓  ↓ f * → C
  \array{
    Cocone(f) &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


may be computed as the ordinary limit over the diagram
    A     ↓ f   C I → C   ↓ * → C,
  \array{
    && && A
    \\
    &&&& \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }
  \,,


where C IC^I is a path space object of CC. This, in turn, may be computed as two consecutive ordinary pullbacks. The first one
  E fC → A   ↓  ↓ f   C I → C   ↓ * → C
  \array{
    && \mathbf{E}_f C &\to& A
    \\
    && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
    &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }


yields the mapping cocylinder E fC\mathbf{E}_f C. This is the kind of object discussed at generalized universal bundle. The second pullback then produces the mapping cocone
Cocone(f) → E fC → A ↓  ↓  ↓ f   C I → C ↓  ↓ * → C.
  \array{
    Cocone(f)  &\to& \mathbf{E}_f C &\to& A
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
    \\
     &&C^I &\to& C
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& C
  }
  \,.


The concept of a smooth set or smooth space, in the sense discussed here, is a generalization of that of smooth manifolds beyond that of diffeological spaces: A smooth set is a generalized smooth space that may be probed by smooth Cartesian spaces.
For expository details see at geometry of physics – smooth sets.
Alternatively, the smooth test spaces may be taken to be more generally all smooth manifolds. But since manifolds themselves are built from gluing together smooth open balls D int n⊂ℝ nD^n_{int} \subset \mathbb{R}^n or equivalently Cartesian spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one may just as well consider Cartesian spaces test spaces. Finally, since D nD^n is diffeomorphic to ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n, one can just as well take just the cartesian smooth spaces ℝ n\mathbb{R}^n as test objects.
The category of smooth spaces is the sheaf topos
SmoothSp:=Sh(Diff)
  SmoothSp := Sh(Diff)


of sheaves on the site Diff of smooth manifolds equipped with its standard coverage (Grothendieck topology) given by open covers of manifolds.
Since DiffDiff is equivalent to the category of manifolds embedded into ℝ ∞\mathbb{R}^\infty, DiffDiff is an essentially small category, so there are no size issues involved in this definition.
But since manifolds themselves are defined in terms of gluing conditons, the Grothendieck topos SmoothSpSmoothSp depends on much less than all of DiffDiff.
Let
Ball:={(D int n→D int m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  Ball := \{ (D^n_{int} \to D^m_{int}) \in Diff | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


and
CartSp:={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}
  CartSp := \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff  | n,m \in \mathbb{N}\}


be the full subcategories BallBall and CartSp of DiffDiff on open balls and on cartesian spaces, respectively. Then the corresponding sheaf toposes are still those of smooth spaces:
SmoothSp ≃Sh(Ball)  ≃Sh(CartSp).
  \begin{aligned}
    SmoothSp &\simeq Sh(Ball)
    \\
     & \simeq Sh(CartSp)
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


An equivalence class is an element of a quotient set.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
An ordinary gauge field (such as the electromagnetic field or the fields that induce the nuclear force) is a field (in the sense of physics) which is locally represented by a differential 1-form (the “gauge potential”) and whose field strength is locally a differential 2-form. For instance, in the case of the electromagnetic field this differential 2-form is the Faraday tensor.
Roughly speaking, a higher gauge field is similarly a field which is locally represented by differential forms of higher degree.
An explanation as to why an ordinary gauge field has a gauge potential given locally by a differential 1-form AA is that the trajectory of a charged particle is a 1-dimensional curve in spacetime XX, its worldline, hence a smooth function γ:Σ 1→X\gamma \colon \Sigma_1 \to X, and the canonical way to produce an action functional on the mapping space of such curves is the integration of 1-forms over curves:
exp(iℏS gauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ 1γ *A).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_1} \gamma^\ast A
  \right)
  \,.


This is the parallel transport map or the holonomy map, if Σ 1\Sigma_1 is a closed manifold. The contribution to the Euler-Lagrange equation of the particle obtained from the variation of this action functional is the Lorentz force which is exerted by the background gauge field on the particle.
When one generalizes in this picture from 0-dimensional particles with 1-dimensional worldlines to pp-dimensional particles (often called “p-branes”) with (p+1)(p+1)-dimensional worldvolumes γ p+1:Σ p+1→X\gamma_{p+1} \colon \Sigma_{p+1} \to X, then one needs, locally, a differential (p+1)-form A p+1A_{p+1} on spacetime XX
exp(iℏS highergauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ p+1γ p+1 *A p+1).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{higher\,gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_{p+1}} \gamma_{p+1}^\ast A_{p+1}
  \right)
  \,.


The field strength or flux of such a higher gauge field is, accordingly, locally the (p+2)(p+2)-form F p+2F_{p+2}.
The archetypical example of such a higher gauge field is the (hypothetical) Kalb-Ramond field or B-field (a precursor of the axion field under KK-compactification) to which the charged 1-brane, the “string”, couples. This is locally a differential 2-form B 2B_2, and the gauge-coupling term in the action functional for the string is accordingly, locally, of the form
exp(iℏS stringygauge):γ↦Pexp(∫ Σ 2γ 2 *B 2).
  \exp(\tfrac{i}{\hbar} S_{stringy\,gauge})
  \;\colon\;
  \gamma
  \mapsto
  P \exp\left(
    \int_{\Sigma_{2}} \gamma_2^\ast B_2
  \right)
  \,.


This continues: next one may consider “2-branes”, i.e. membranes, and these will couple to a 3-form gauge field. For instance, the membrane which gives the name to M-theory (the M2-brane) couples to a 3-form field called the supergravity C-field.
But there is an important further aspect to higher gauge fields which makes this simple picture of higher degree differential forms drastically more rich:
Where an ordinary gauge field has gauge transformations A 1↦A′ 1A_1 \mapsto A'_1 given locally by smooth functions (0-forms) λ 0\lambda_0 via the de Rham differential d dRd_{dR}
A′ 1=A 1+d dRλ 0
  A'_1 = A_1 + d_{dR} \lambda_0


so a higher gauge field has higher gauge transformations given locally by pp-forms λ p\lambda_p:
A′ p+1=A p+1+d dRλ p.
  A'_{p+1} = A_{p+1} + d_{dR} \lambda_{p}
  \,.


But for p≥0p \geq 0 then a crucial new effect appears: these gauge transformations, being higher differential forms themselves, have “gauge-of-gauge transformations” between them, given by lower degree forms.
This phenomenon implies that higher gauge fields have a rich global (“topological”) structure, witnessed by the higher analog of their instanton sectors. Namely, while a higher gauge field to which a p-brane may couple is locally given by a (p+1)(p+1)-form A p+1A_{p+1}, as one moves across coordinate charts this form gauge transforms by a pp-form, which then itself, as one passes along two charts, transforms by a (p−1)(p-1)-form, and so on.
The global structure for higher gauge fields obtained by carrying out this globalization via higher gauge transformations is the higher analog of that of a fiber bundle with connection on a bundle in higher differential geometry. This is sometimes known as a gerbe or, more generally, a principal infinity-bundle.
In fact the situation that there is just one gauge potential of degree (p+1)(p+1) with field strength of degree (p+2)(p+2) is just the simplest case, the “ordinary” case. More abstractly one says that such higher gauge fields are cocycles in ordinary differential cohomology.
More generally it may happen in higher gauge theory that the gauge potential is a formal linear combination of differential forms in various degrees.
The canonical example of this phenomenon is the RR-field in string theory. This has, locally, a gauge potential which is a differential form in every even degree, or every odd degree. If one is careful about the higher gauge transformations in this situation to find the correct global structure (the “instanton sector”) of the higher gauge field, then one finds that this now is a cocycle in a differential generalized cohomology, namely, in what is called differential topological K-theory. This may be understood as a higher and generalized form of the famous Dirac charge quantization condition for the electromagnetic field, see Freed 00. A lot of the fine detail of the anomaly cancellation in type II string theory depends on being careful about the global nature of this K-theoretic higher gauge RR-field (Distler-Freed-Moore 09)
In gauge theory two configurations ϕ 1,ϕ 2\phi_1, \phi_2 of gauge fields may be different and still be equivalent: there may be a gauge transformation λ:ϕ 1→ϕ 2\lambda \colon \phi_1 \to \phi_2 between them.
In higher gauge theory also gauge transformations themseves may be different but still equivalent: if there is a gauge-of-gauge transformation ρ:λ 1→λ 2\rho \colon \lambda_1 \to \lambda_2 between them.
These higher order gauge transformations are maybe best known in the physics literature in terms of their infinitesimal approximation, the BRST complex: here the gauge transformations correspond to ghost fields and the gauge-of-gauge transformations to ghost-of-ghost fields.
In gauge theory the configuration space/phase space is not in general a smooth space, but a smooth groupoid: the gauge transformations between gauge fields are the morphisms of this groupoid.
The infinitesimal approximation to this smooth groupoid is a Lie algebroid. The dg-algebra of functions on this is called the BRST complex of the gauge theory. It contains in degree-0 the (duals to) the gauge fields and in degree-1 the cotangents to the gauge transformations. These degree-1 elements that appear here alongside the physical fields in degree 0 are called ghost fields in the physics literature.
If there are higher gauge transformations “gauge-of-gauge transformations” then the BRST complex has generators in higher degree, too, the cotangents to these higher gauge transformations. These are then called ghost-of-ghost fields.
For more details and further pointers see at BRST complex and in particular at BV-BRST formalism.
What is called the “BRST complex” in the physics literature is the qDGCA which is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the L ∞L_\infty-algebroid which is the differential version in Lie theory of the ∞\infty-groupoid


whose space of objects is the space of configurations/histories of a given physical system;


whose morphisms describe the gauge transformations between these configurations/histories;


whose kk-morphisms describe the kk-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations.


The generators of the BRST complex are called


in degree 0: fields;


in degree 1: ghost field;


in degree 2: ghost-of-ghost fields;


etc.


The cochain cohomology of the BRST complex is called, of course, BRST cohomology.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
For monopole charges in electromagnetism
If the field of electromagnetism serves as a background gauge field for electrically charged quantum particles it is subject to a quantization condition: Outside the locus of any magnetic charge – for instance a magnetic monopole topological defect – the electromagnetic field must be a connection on a principal U(1) bundle whose first Chern class is the discrete measure for the units of magnetic charge. Equivalently this means that the electromagnetic field is a cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology of degree 2.
In the underlying topological sector (“monopole”/“instantons”-sector) this is integral cohomology in degree-2, whose classifying space is equivalently the infinite complex projective space BU(1)≃ℂP ∞B U(1) \simeq \mathbb{C}P^\infty:
 \,



This goes back to an insight due to Dirac 31. See Heras 18 for traditional elementary review, but see Alvarez 85, Frankel and Mangiarotti-Sardanashvily 00 for exposition of the modern picture in terms of fiber bundles in physics. See Freed 00, Section 2 for review in terms of differential cohomology with outlook to generalization to higher gauge fields in string theory (more on which in the references below).
A closely related phenomenon is the magnetic flux quantization in type II superconductors, see there.
On the locus of the magnetic charge itself the situation is more complex. There the magnetic current is given by a cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology of degree 3 (with compact support) and now the electromagnetic field is a connection on a twisted bundle (Freed 00, Section 2).

For monopole charges in non-abelian Yang-Mills theory
A similar charge quantization condition govers monopoles in SU(2)-Yang-Mills theory, see at moduli space of monopoles. Here the Atiyah-Hitchin charge quantization (Atiyah-Hitchin 88, Theorem 2.10) says that the moduli space of monopoles is the complex-rational 2-Cohomotopy of an asymptotic 2-sphere enclosing the monopoles:
 \,



For RR-field D-brane charges in K-theory

Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic field F∈Ω 2(X)F \in \Omega^2(X) on a dd-dimensional spacetime XX in the presence of electric current j el∈Ω d−1(X)j_{el} \in \Omega^{d-1}(X) read
dF=0
  d F = 0


d⋆F=j el.
  d \star F = j_{el}
  \,.


Formally this suggests an immediate generalization where a conserved current called the magnetic current j mag∈Ω 3(X)j_{mag} \in \Omega^{3}(X) is introduced and the first of the equations above is replaced by
dF=j mag.
  d F = j_{mag}
  \,.


The corresponding charge is the magnetic charge.
One thing to notice about this is that

net magnetic charge has not been observed in nature.

The other thing is a more conceptual problem: the Dirac quantization condition says that the 22-form FF is not entirely arbitrary, but constrained to be the characteristic curvature 22-form of a degree-22 cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology, for instance the curvature 22-form of a U(1)U(1)-principal bundle with connection. But this necessarily implies that dF=0d F = 0.
Indeed, to circumvent dealing with this problem Dirac, in his original argument, has considered removing from XX the support of any magnetic charge density.
It was Dan Freed in (Freed) who discussed that the global description of the electromagnetic field does make sense even in the presence of electric current if one generalizes the model of a degree-22 differential cocycle to that of a twisted cocycle.
The magnetic current 33-form j magj_{mag} is then realized as the curvature characteristic 33-form of a degree-33 cocycle in ordinary differential cohomology j^ mag\hat j_{mag}, the electromagnetic field FF is the curvature characteristic 22-form of a degree-22 twisted differential cocycle F^\hat F and the equation
dF=j mag
  d F = j_{mag}


expresses the twisting of F^\hat F by j^ mag\hat j_{mag} at the level of curvature forms.
This means that Dirac almost found bundle gerbes already in 1931, had he not discussed only the neighbourhood of magnetic monopoles.
In gauge theory two configurations ϕ 1,ϕ 2\phi_1, \phi_2 of gauge fields may be different and still be equivalent: there may be a gauge transformation λ:ϕ 1→ϕ 2\lambda \colon \phi_1 \to \phi_2 between them.
In higher gauge theory also gauge transformations themseves may be different but still equivalent: if there is a gauge-of-gauge transformation ρ:λ 1→λ 2\rho \colon \lambda_1 \to \lambda_2 between them.
These higher order gauge transformations are maybe best known in the physics literature in terms of their infinitesimal approximation, the BRST complex: here the gauge transformations correspond to ghost fields and the gauge-of-gauge transformations to ghost-of-ghost fields.

String theory is a theory in fundamental physics. Certainly it is, mathematically, a structure that contains in various limits a plethora of quantum field theories. Its interest for experimental high energy physics lies in the hypothesis that it provides a theory of everything in the sense of fundamental physics, but the jury on that is still out.
Below we indicate the basic idea and provide pointers to further details. See also the string theory FAQ.
Conceptually: From QFT worldline formalism
Perturbative string theory is something at least close to a categorification of the following description of perturbative quantum field theory in terms of sums over Feynman diagrams.
Recall that in quantum field theory one approach to make sense of the path integral is the perturbation series expansion, which interprets the path integral for the scattering amplitudes (the S-matrix) as a certain sum over graphs of certain numbers assigned to each graph.
The graphs are called Feynman diagrams, the numbers assigned to them are called (renormalized) scattering amplitudes and the sum over graphs of (renormalized) amplitudes is the perturbation series or S-matrix.
The amplitude assigned to a single graph with nn external edges is interpreted as the amplitude for nn “quanta” or “particles” of the fields in question to interact in the way indicated by the graph.
Crucial for the motivation of the idea of string theory is the observation that this (renormalized) amplitude assigned to a graph is itself the correlator of a 1-dimensional quantum field theory on that graph: the “worldline quantum field theory” describing the (relativistic) quantum mechanics of these particles. This is usually a sigma-model with parameter space the given graph and target space the spacetime on which the fields live for which the perturbation series computes the path integral.
When made explicit this is called the worldline formalism for computing the quantum field perturbation series. (See there for more details.)
The premise of perturbative string theory is to replace the perturbation series over correlators of a 1-d QFT over graphs by a sum of correlators of a 2-dQFT over 2-dimensional surfaces – called worldsheets and hence produce an S-matrix this way. Again in simple cases this 2d QFT is a sigma-model whose target is the spacetime in which one computes interactions.


graphics grabbed from Jurke 10

In analogy to the previous case, one thinks of the amplitude assigned this way to a surface as the amplitude for the boundary arcs – the strings – to interact in the way given by the surface.
Some of the motivations for considering this replacement of graphs by surfaces have been the following:


the 2-d correlators are better behaved in that they don’t have to be renormalized. The “counterterms” appearing in renormalization of ordinary QFT can be identified with contributions to the correlators that come from the linear extension of the strings (see the above reference for more on this);


there are fewer choices involved: a Feynman graph is really a decorated graph with the decoration from some more or less arbitrary index set, describing the nature of the particles associated with a given edge and the nature of the interaction associated with a given vertex. In the sum over surfaces there is no extra decoration (except on the boundary of the surfaces) and one finds that instead a single string diagram (a 2d QFT correlator for a given surface) encodes already a sum over (infinitely) many particle species decorations and all possible interaction decorations for them;


while there are fewer choices to be made by hand, it turns out that the effective particle content that does arise automatically from this prescription happens to be structurally of the kind one would hope for: the massless effective particles described by the string perturbation series happen to be gauge bosons, fermions charged under them, and, notably, gravitons. This is structurally exactly the Yang-Mills theory input of the standard model of particle physics combined with perturbative quantum gravity that one would hope to see.


These aspects have motivated the impression that the string perturbation series might be considerably closer to the true formalism of fundamental physics than ordinary perturbative quantum field theory. This impression is however offset by the following problems:


while the worldsheet 2d QFT whose correlators are summed over surfaces are themselves much easier to handle than the full target space quantum physics they are used to encode, a fully complete and rigorous theory of 2d QFT is available only in simple special cases.


In particular, even though there are fewer arbitrary choices involved in the string perturbation series as compared to the ordinary Feynman perturbation series, one crucial choice still present is that of this worldsheet 2d QFT. By the above, every choice of worldsheet QFT (called a choice of “vacuum”) corresponds to a choice of effective target space geometry (to be thought of as the one that the perturbation series computes the quantum perturbations about) and particle content (see 2-spectral triple for more on that). One would therefore like to understand the space of all worldsheet QFTs whose effective target space geometry and particle content is close to the one experimentally observed. After many years of rather naïve approaches to handle or not to handle this, it has more recently at least come to the general attention that there is something to be better understood here.


More fundamentally, already the role of the original perturbation series in quantum field theory is actually not fully understood. Its main success is the observation that truncating or resumming the perturbation series in a more or less ad hoc way, it does yield values that very well describe a plethora of real world measurements. One imagines that there is a non-perturbative definition of quantum field theory such that in certain well-defined circumstances the perturbation series does yield an approximation to it and is a posteriori justified. If so, there should be an analogous nonperturbative definition of string theory. There is a large ratio of speculations as to what that might be over solid results about it.


Phenomenologically
While therefore the premise of perturbative string theory is conceptually suggestive for various reasons, there is to date no connection to experimental phenomenology (apart from the fact that conceptual insights into string theory have helped analyze quantum field theoretic data, see at string theory results applied elsewhere). As a result much of the substantial outcome of string theory research is more in mathematical physics (if done well, at least), exploring the general theory space of quantum field theories and their UV-completions, than in realistic model building (though there is no lack of trying), where it remains very speculative. This has led to public or semi-public debates about the value of string theory for actual physics. See at criticism of string theory for pointers.

The standard model of particle physics is a model (in particle physics): a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles currently experimentally known, containing

matter: electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other fermions,

as well as three of the four fundamental forces as currently known, which, somewhat roughly, are

force: the electroweak force (including electromagnetism) and the strong nuclear force.

It is defined as a local Lagrangian field theory which is an Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-Dirac-Higgs theory.
The main ingredient missing from the standard model is the quantum version of the field of gravity. For decades, a large part of theoretical physics has been absorbed with attempts to understand how this last of the known fundamental forces might fit into the picture.
As a quantum field theory, the standard model is in particular a Yang–Mills gauge theory with spinors in Yang–Mills theory.
Although there are several approaches to formulate a mathematically precise definition of what a quantum field theory is, there is no rigorous formulation (yet) that comprises the whole standard model.
Gauge group
The exact gauge group of the standard model is not quite the product group
U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)


of the circle group with special unitary groups, but is the quotient group
(1)G SM=(U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3))/ℤ 6
  
  G_{SM} 
  \;=\;
  \big(
    U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \big)
  / \mathbb{Z}_6


of that by a cyclic group ℤ 6⊂U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)\mathbb{Z}_6 \subset U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3) which is the subgroup generated from an element of the form
(q 6,q 21 2,q 31 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3),
  (q_6, q_2 \mathbf{1}_2, q_3 \mathbf{1}_3) \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,,


where q n∈U(1)q_n \in U(1) denotes an nnth primitive root of unity, i.e.
(e 2πi16,e 2πi121 2,e 2πi131 3)∈U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3).
  \left(
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{6}}
    \;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{2}} \mathbf{1}_2\;,\; 
    e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{1}{3}} \mathbf{1}_3
  \right) 
  \;\in\;
  U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)
  \,.


(See Baez-Huerta 09, p. 33-36 for a fairly comprehensive discussion. See also e.g. HMY 13, p. 2.)
Strikingly, this exact gauge group (1) of the standard model of particle physics happens to coincide with…


…the group
G SM≃S(U(2)×U(3))⊂SU(5)
   G_{SM} 
    \;\simeq\; 
   S\big(U(2) \times U(3)\big) 
    \;\subset\; 
   SU(5)


of determinant-1 elements in the direct product group U(2)×U(3)U(2) \times U(3), which makes manifest that the standard model gauge group is a subgroup of the simple Lie group SU(5).
This is the basis of “grand unified theories” (GUT), speculative extensions of the standard model trying to understand its gauge group as being a spontaneously broken simple Lie group-symmetry.


…the subgroup of the Jordan algebra automorphism group of the octonionic Albert algebra that “stabilizes a 4d sub-Minkowski spacetime” (see there for details).
More concretely, it is identified with the subgroup of Spin(9) which respects a splitting ℍ⊕ℍ≃ ℝℂ⊕ℂ 3\mathbb{H} \oplus \mathbb{H} \simeq_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{C} \oplus \mathbb{C}^3 (Krasnov 19, see also at SO(10)-GUT)


This is part of ongoing speculation that octonionic exceptional structures might be behind the standard model.

A field configuration of the physical theory of gravity on a spacetime XX is equivalently


a vielbein field, hence a reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle along BO(n−1,1)→BGL(n)\mathbf{B} O(n-1,1) \to \mathbf{B}GL(n), defining a pseudo-Riemannian metric;


a connection that is locally a Lie algebra-valued 1-form with values in the Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω):TX→𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E, \Omega) : T X \to \mathfrak{iso}(d-1,1)


such that this is a Cartan connection.


(This parameterization of the gravitational field is called the first-order formulation of gravity.) The component EE of the connection is the vielbein that encodes a pseudo-Riemannian metric g=E⋅Eg = E \cdot E on XX and makes XX a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Its quanta are the gravitons.
The non-propagating field? Ω\Omega is the spin connection.
The action functional on the space of such connection which defines the classical field theory of gravity is the Einstein-Hilbert action.
More generally, supergravity is a gauge theory over a supermanifold XX for the super Poincare group. The field of supergravity is a Lie-algebra valued form with values in the super Poincare Lie algebra.
(E,Ω,Ψ):TX→𝔰𝔦𝔰𝔬(d−1,1)
  (E,\Omega, \Psi) : T X \to \mathfrak{siso}(d-1,1)


The additional fermionic field Ψ\Psi is the gravitino field.
So the configuration space of gravity on some XX is essentially the moduli space of Riemannian metrics on XX.
In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)
Formalization of mathematical reasoning can be presented in different forms. The framework of natural deduction describes a particular class of deductive systems which is supposed to be close to “natural” deductive reasoning insofar it is based on the idea of reasoning from assumptions in contrast to proof systems that reason from ‘truths’ in the tradition of Hilbertian axiomatics. It is used particularly to present the syntax of formal logic and type theory.

Remark
The phrase “natural deduction” is not always used to mean the same thing. Some people use it semi-informally to refer to a “sort of reasoning” that involves making assumptions, perhaps formalized using hypothetical judgments. Other people take it to refer specifically to deductive systems which are presented using introduction and elimination rules, which is the meaning we adopt on this page. There is significant overlap between the two meanings, but they are not identical.

Relation to category theory
The four classes of rules of natural deduction combined give alternative specifications of universal constructions in category theory. In categorical semantics one considers categories which are such that their objects are regarded as types and their generalized elements as terms, then the rules of natural deductions describe the possible construction of morphisms in that category.
For instance, the connectives of type theory are presentations of functors, but their action on morphisms is not explicitly defined, because  the action is definable from the introduction and elimination rules.
(…)
Decidability
(…)
In general two objects are considered equivalent if they may be replaced by one another in all contexts under consideration (see also the principle of equivalence).
At the propositional level, the general theory of equivalence is discussed at equivalence relation, but that leaves us with the question of the correct definition of equivalence in various situations. Furthermore, we can work on a higher level and ask what the equivalences are, not just whether things are equivalent.
There is a lot of interesting stuff to be said about equality in logic, higher category theory, and the foundations of mathematics, but it hasn't all been said here yet.
In mathematics and especially in formal logic, by a judgement [Frege (1879, §2)] one means the assertion [Russell & Whitehead (1910, p. xviii)] or validation [Kochen (1961, p. 2)] of a proposition PP, hence the claim (or even the specification) of a proof of PP [Church (1940, §5)].
To bring out the subtle (cf. jstor:43154266) but crucial distinction — eloquently amplified by Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2) — between the notion of a proposition PP as such and the judgement/assertion/validation/proof of its truth, it is tradition to prefix the latter with the symbol “⊢\vdash”, known as the Urteilsstrich (German: “judgement stroke”) of [Frege (1879, §2)] (see the historical pointers below), as:
(1)⊢P.
  
  \vdash \; P
  \,.


For example, the Riemann hypothesis certainly is a proposition, but it remains open whether we may truthfully assert or validate it, hence we cannot yet judge that it holds true: No proof is known, even though it seems likely to be in fact true.
In other words, the judgement symbols “⊢P\vdash \, P ” convey that we know (a proof of, hence the truth of) PP [Martin-Löf (1996, lectures 1-2)].
As such, judgements may be formalized as “meta-proposition”, namely propositions but in an ambient meta-language (the deductive system or logical framework) rather than to the object language in which the given PP itself is formulated. (More specifically, any deductive system includes, as part of its specification, which strings of symbols are to be regarded as the judgments. Some of these symbols may themselves express a proposition in the object language, but this is not necessarily the case.)
More generally, one considers hypothetical judgements (maybe first made explicit in [Church (1940, §5)]) which are such assertions/validations but conditioned on premises, hence claims/specifications of proofs based on assumptions AA: Writing
(2)A⊢P
 
  A \;\;\vdash\;\; P


is to express the judgement that given any assertion/validation/proof of AA we know how to produce (from that) a validation/proof of PP.
In systems of (dependent) type theory (where such notation seems to go back to Hofmann (1995, p. 31), cf. below) this is quite literally the case in that the categorical semantics of such a hypothetical judgement is a given by a function (and typically a computable function, hence an algorithm) which maps proofs of AA to proofs of PP.
More generally yet, in type theory the propositions AA and PP appearing here are allowed to be any (dependent) types (see at propositions as types). In this generality, the denotational semantics of hypothetical judgements (2) is given by (computable) functions/morphisms with domain AA and codomain PP. In programming languages based on such type theories this translates to the denotation of an actual program which produces data of data type PP when run on input data of data type AA.
Judgements are themselves subject to a calculus of natural deduction by which further judgements may be inferred from given ones. For example the notation
A⊢P 1,A⊢P 1A⊢P 1×P 2
  \frac{
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1
    ,\,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
    A \;\;\vdash\;\; P_1    
  }{
    A 
      \;\;\vdash\;\; 
    P_1 \times P_2
  }


traditionally expresses that whenever we can assert both P 1P_1 as well as P 2P_2 assuming a validation of AA (hence: given a pair of functions with domain type AA), then with that same assumption we find assertion/validation/proof of their logical conjunction P 1×P 2P_1 \times P_2 (namely a function with codomain to their product type).
Finally, to make explicit which particular assumptions a hypothetical judgement really depends on, it is common to adjoin a generic context symbol Γ\Gamma to the hypothesis on the left hand side of the Urteilsstrich: Notation such as
Γ,a:A⊢p a:P
  \Gamma
  ,\,\;\;
  a \colon A
  \;\;\;
  \vdash
  \;\;\;
  p_a \,\colon\, P


expresses the judgement that PP may be asserted given validation of Γ×A\Gamma \times A, but that in doing so only the validation of AA is actually made use of, while Γ\Gamma may be any context of assumptions (whose validation might however be used in previous/further deduction steps).
In gauge theory two configurations ϕ 1,ϕ 2\phi_1, \phi_2 of gauge fields may be different and still be equivalent: there may be a gauge transformation λ:ϕ 1→ϕ 2\lambda \colon \phi_1 \to \phi_2 between them.
In higher gauge theory also gauge transformations themseves may be different but still equivalent: if there is a gauge-of-gauge transformation ρ:λ 1→λ 2\rho \colon \lambda_1 \to \lambda_2 between them.
These higher order gauge transformations are maybe best known in the physics literature in terms of their infinitesimal approximation, the BRST complex: here the gauge transformations correspond to ghost fields and the gauge-of-gauge transformations to ghost-of-ghost fields.
Local gauge transformations
In physics the term local gauge transformation or gauge equivalence means essentially isomorphism or rather equivalence in an (infinity,1)-category: the configuration space of a physical theory is typically a groupoid (an orbifold) and a gauge transformation between configurations is a morphism in this groupoid.
More specifically, in physical theories called gauge theory – such as describing electromagnetism and Yang-Mills fields – the configuration space is a space of GG-principal bundles (over spacetime XX) with connection over a Lie group GG called the gauge group. A gauge transformation in the strict and original sense of the word is a morphism in the groupoid GBund ∇(X)G Bund_\nabla(X) of these bundles with connection.
In this context the connection ∇\nabla itself – usually thought of in terms of its local Lie-algebra valued 1-forms (A i∈Ω 1(U i⊂X,𝔤))(A_i \in \Omega^1(U_i \subset X, \mathfrak{g})) – is the gauge field . The equation
A′ i=h i −1A ih i+h i −1dh i;h i∈C ∞(U i,G)
  A'_i = h_i^{-1} A_i h_i + h_i^{-1} d h_i \;\;\;\; ; \;\; h_i \in C^\infty(U_i,G)


that characterizes morphisms A i→gA′ iA_i \stackrel{g}{\to} A'_i in the groupoid of Lie-algebra valued forms is historically the hallmark of the “gauge principle” and is often what is meant specifically by gauge transformation .
But from there on the terminology generalizes to almost all physical theories. For one this is because the configuration space of many theories may be thought of as spaces of bundles with connections, notably also for gravity.
Moreover, many formal physical theories such as Chern-Simons theory, supergravity, etc. are described by higher categorical generalizations of bundles with connections: principal ∞-bundles with connection on a principal ∞-bundle such as the Chern-Simons circle 3-bundle. Their configuration spaces form not just groupoids but ∞-groupoids. The higher morphisms in these are called higher gauge transformations.
For instance the configuration space of the Kalb-Ramond field is the 2-groupoid of circle 2-bundles with connection over spacetime. An object in there is locally given by a 2-form B i∈Ω 2(U i⊂X)B_i \in \Omega^2(U_i \subset X). A 1-morphism in there is a first order gauge transformation B i→λB′ iB_i \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} B'_i characterized by the equation B i′=B i+d dRλ iB_i' = B_i + d_{dR} \lambda_i. A 2-morphism in there is a second order gauge transformation λ i⇒g iλ′ i\lambda_i \stackrel{g_i}{\Rightarrow} \lambda'_i characterized by λ′ i=λ i+d dRg i\lambda'_i = \lambda_i + d_{dR} g_i.
The Lie algebroid of the groupoid of configurations and gauge transformations is known in physics in terms of its dual Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra called the BRST-complex. The degree 1 generators in this dg-algebra are hence the functions on infinitesimal gauge transformations. (A discussion of such infinitesimal transformations is here.) These graded functions on infintesimal gauge transformations are called ghost fields or ghosts for short, in the physics literature.
If the space of configurations is not just a groupoid in ordinary spaces but a groupoid in derived spaces such as derived smooth manifolds, then the CE-algebra of the corresponding derived ∞-Lie algebroid is called the BV-BRST complex.
Global gauge transformations
See global gauge group.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
Type theory is a branch of mathematical symbolic logic, which derives its name from the fact that it formalizes not only mathematical terms – such as a variable xx, or a function ff – and operations on them, but also formalizes the idea that each such term is of some definite type, for instance that the type ℕ\mathbb{N} of a natural number x:ℕx : \mathbb{N} is different from the type ℕ→ℕ\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} of a function f:ℕ→ℕf : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} between natural numbers.
Explicitly, type theory is a formal language, essentially a set of rules for rewriting certain strings of symbols, that describes the introduction of types and their terms, and computations with these, in a sensible way.
What may seem like a triviality on first sight turns out to have deep implications:


foundations of mathematics. On the one hand, logic itself is subsumed in the plain idea of operations on terms of types, by observing that any type XX may be thought of as the type of terms satisfying some proposition. Under this propositions are types-paradigm a proof of the proposition is nothing but a term of the corresponding type. This identification leads to a very fruitful identification of operations on types with logical operations.


programming language. Since such a proof is constructive, the term witnessing it being a concrete implementation, and since type theory strictly works by rewriting rules, one may identify the construction of a term in type theory as a program whose output is a certain type. Under this proofs as programs-paradigm, type theory is a mathematical formalization of a programming language. (For instance, Coq and Agda are concrete machine implementations of such a language. They are used both in computer science, where the typing provides certified programming, and may one day be usable in industry.)


calculus for category theory. On the other hand, if one regards, as is natural, any term t:Xt : X to exist in a context Γ\Gamma of other terms x:Γ x : \Gamma, then tt is naturally identified with a “map” t:Γ→Xt : \Gamma \to X, hence: with a morphism. Viewed this way the types and terms of type theory are identified, respectively, with the objects and morphisms of category theory. From this perspective, type theory provides a formal language for speaking about categories. Indeed, from this perspective type theory is formalization along the lines of the Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets.


These aspects naturally harmonize, involving, reflecting on, and subsuming internal logic of categories and categorical logic/categorical semantics in categories.
Moreover, when following the idea of type theory through seriously, it turns out to go well beyond these topics even: If all logical statements are to be witnessed by terms of the type that corresponds to the given proposition, then this should notably be true for what is maybe the most basic logical notion, that of equality. Therefore it makes sense to demand for any two terms x,y:Xx,y : X of a type XX the existence of an identity type Id X(x,y)Id_X(x,y) which represents the proposition that xx is equal to yy, hence such that a term p:Id X(x,y)p : Id_X(x,y) is a proof of this fact. But this idea necessarily iterates, with the equality of two such proofs in turn being witnessed by a term of a second order identity type, and so on. Reflecting on this shows that the type-theoretic notion of equality resulting this way is not the traditional one, but is the notion of homotopy equivalence or equivalence in an (∞,1)-category. Type theory with such identity types properly implemented is thus called homotopy type theory. It is a calculus now for (∞,1)-category theory. See there for more details on this.
Notice that this is obtained not by adding something to the basic idea of type theory, but by removing something, namely the ad-hoc assumption of definite equality.
Similarly, while plain vanilla type theory formalizes intuitionistic logic/intuitionistic mathematics, it is possible to add by hand, if necessary for some reason, axioms such as the law of excluded middle to make type theory also describe classical logic. But by nature it is more general.
In any predicate logic over type theory, propositional equality is the notion of equality which is defined to be a proposition. Propositional equality is most commonly used in set theories like ZFC and ETCS, but it could also be used for definitional equality and conversional equality in some presentations of dependent type theories like Martin-Löf type theory or cubical type theory in place of judgmental equality.
Propositional equality can be contrasted with judgmental equality, where equality is a judgment, and typal equality, where equality is a type.
Note on terminology
Historically in the dependent type theory community, the term propositional equality was used for typal equality. This was because under the principle of propositions as types, one interprets all types in a single-layer type theory as being propositions. However, we choose to make a distinction between propositional equality and typal equality. First, propositional equality as defined in this article is used in the most common foundations of mathematics, such as ZFC and ETCS, and is clearly not a type. Additionally, in some logics over type theory, one can have three distinct notions of equality: judgmental equality, propositional equality, and typal equality. Finally, in the advent of homotopy type theory and other type theoretic higher foundations, typal equality is no longer required to be a subsingleton or h-proposition, and the alternative principle of propositions as some types has become the primary interpretation of dependent type theory, where only the subsingletons or h-propositions are interpreted as propositions.
By intensional type theory one means (but see Rem. ) the flavor of type theory in which identity types are not forced to be mere propositions (that is: not necessarily (-1)-truncated).
The original definition of identity types in Martin-Löf dependent type theory [Martin-Löf (1975, §1.7 and p. 94)] is by default intensional: It takes an additional axiom or rule — the identity reflection rule, cf. Streicher (1993, p. 4, 13 ); Hofmann (1995, p. 16) — to turn intensional into extensional type theory (in which identity types are then truncated to mere propositions).
In particular, homotopy type theory is intensional: the categorical semantics of its identity types are path space objects.


Remark
(terminology)  Beware that some authors take the words “intensional type theory” to refer to type theories which fail to satisfy function extensionality. This is in general a requirement orthogonal to the (-1)-truncation of identity types.
Generally, the origin of the names “extensional” and “intensional” is somewhat confusing. Even where the term refers to the behaviour of equality, it in fact refers not to the typal equality expressed by identity types, but to judgmental equality:
The idea is that the identity type is always an “extensional” notion of equality (although it can be more or less extensional, depending on whether further extensionality principles like function extensionality and univalence hold). Thus, if the judgmental equality coincides with the identity type, then the former is also extensional, whence the type theory is called “extensional” — while if the two equalities do not coincide, then the judgmental equality has room to be more intensional than the identity type, making the type theory “intensional” (but see also Hofmann (1995, ftn. 3), p. 17).
(On this historical reading, “extensional type theory” should refer only to judgmentally extensional type theory with the reflection rule, which is much stronger than merely requiring all types to be h-sets.)


Decidability
Only the intensional but not the extensional Martin-Löf type theory has decidable type checking. (Martin-Löf 75, Hofmann 95).
In modern logic, we understand that every variable should have a type, or domain of discourse or be of some sort. For instance we say that if a variable nn is constrained to be an integer then “nn is of integer type” or “of type ℤ\mathbb{Z}”. The usual formal expression from set theory for this – n∈ℤn \in \mathbb{Z} – is then often written n:ℤn \colon \mathbb{Z}
We speak of typed logic if this typing of variables is enforced by the metalanguage. In formulations of a theory the types are often called sorts. More generally, type theory formalizes reasoning with such typed variables. See there for more
(Untyped logic may be seen as simply a special case, in which there is only a single unique type. Thus, untyped logic has one type, not no type.)
Reasoning with types is formalized in natural deduction (which in turn is formalized in a logical framework such as Elf).
Behaviour of types is specified by a 4-step set of rules


type formation


term introduction


term elimination


computation rules


Deep relations between type theory, category theory and computer science relate types to other notions, such as objects in a category. See at computational trinitarianism for more on this.
In many categories CC in which one does homotopy theory, there is a notion of homotopy between morphisms, which is closely related to the 2-morphisms in higher category theory: a homotopy between two morphisms is a way in which they are equivalent.
If we regard such a category as a presentation of an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category, then homotopies f∼gf\sim g present the 2-cells f⇒gf\Rightarrow g in the resulting (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category.
In topological spaces

Definition
For f,g:X⟶Yf,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y two continuous functions between topological spaces X,YX,Y, then a left homotopy
η:f⇒ Lg
  \eta \colon f \,\Rightarrow_L\, g


is a continuous function
η:X×I⟶Y
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y


out of the standard cylinder object over XX: the product space of XX with the Euclidean closed interval I≔[0,1]I \coloneqq [0,1], such that this fits into a commuting diagram of the form


X  (id,δ 0)↓ ↘ f X×I ⟶η Y  (id,δ 1)↑ ↗ g X.
  \array{
     X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     X \times I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.


(graphics grabbed from J. Tauber here)


Example
Let XX be a topological space and let x,y∈Xx,y \in X be two of its points, regarded as functions x,y:*⟶Xx,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X from the point to XX. Then a left homotopy, def. , between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form
*  δ 0↓ ↘ x I ⟶η X  δ 1↑ ↗ y *.
  \array{
     \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
     \\
     I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{y}}
     \\
     \ast
  }
  \,.


This is simply a continuous path in XX whose endpoints are xx and yy.

In enriched categories
If CC is enriched over Top, then a homotopy in CC between maps f,g:X⇉Yf,g:X\,\rightrightarrows \,Y is a map H:[0,1]→C(X,Y)H:[0,1] \to C(X,Y) in TopTop such that H(0)=fH(0)=f and H(1)=gH(1)=g. In TopTop itself this is the classical notion.
If CC has copowers, then an equivalent definition is a map [0,1]⊙X→Y[0,1]\odot X\to Y, while if it has powers, an equivalent definition is a map X→⋔([0,1],Y)X\to \pitchfork([0,1],Y).
There is a similar definition in a simplicially enriched category, replacing [0,1][0,1] with the 1-simplex Δ 1\Delta^1, with the caveat that in this case not all simplicial homotopies need be composable even if they match correctly. (This depends on whether or not all (2,1)-horns in the simplicial set, C(X,Y)C(X,Y), have fillers.) Likewise in a dg-category we can use the “chain complex interval” to get a notion of chain homotopy.
In model categories
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a model category, it has an intrinsic notion of homotopy determined by its factorizations. For more on the following see at homotopy in a model category.

Definition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a model category and X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object.

A path object Path(X)Path(X) for XX is a factorization of the diagonal ∇ X:X→X×X\nabla_X \colon X \to X \times X as

∇ X:X⟶∈WiPath(X)⟶(p 0,p 1)X×X.
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
   X \underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow} Path(X) \overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.


where X→Path(X)X\to Path(X) is a weak equivalence. This is called a good path object if in addition Path(X)→X×XPath(X) \to X \times X is a fibration.

A cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) for XX is a factorization of the codiagonal (or “fold map”) Δ X:X⊔X→X\Delta_X: X \sqcup X \to X as

Δ X:X⊔X⟶(i 0,i 1)Cyl(X)⟶p∈WX.
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \underoverset{p}{\in W}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.


where Cyl(X)→XCyl(X) \to X is a weak equivalence. This is called a good cylinder object if in addition X⊔X→Cyl(X)X \sqcup X \to Cyl(X) is a cofibration.


Remark
By the factorization axioms every object in a model category has both a good path object and as well as a good cylinder object according to def. . But in some situations one is genuinely interested in using non-good such objects.
For instance in the classical model structure on topological spaces, the obvious object X×[0,1]X\times [0,1] is a cylinder object, but not a good cylinder unless XX itself is cofibrant (a cell complex in this case).
More generally, the path object Path(X)Path(X) of def.  is analogous to the powering ⋔(I,X)\pitchfork(I,X) with an interval object and the cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) is analogous to the tensoring I⊙XI\odot X with an interval object. In fact, if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a VV-enriched model category and XX is fibrant/cofibrant, then these powers and copowers are in fact examples of (good) path and cylinder objects if the interval object is sufficiently good.


Definition
Let f,g:X⟶Yf,g \colon X \longrightarrow Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.

A left homotopy η:f⇒ Lg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_L g is a morphism η:Cyl(X)⟶Y\eta \colon Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y from a cylinder object of XX, def. , such that it makes this diagram commute:

X ⟶ Cyl(X) ⟵ X   f↘ ↓ η ↙ g   Y.
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& Cyl(X) &\longleftarrow& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow &\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    && 
    Y
  }
  \,.



A right homotopy η:f⇒ Rg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_R g is a morphism η:X→Path(Y)\eta \colon X \to Path(Y) to some path object of XX, def. , such that this diagram commutes:

  X   f↙ ↓ η ↘ g Y ⟵ Path(Y) ⟶ Y.
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} 
    \\
    Y &\longleftarrow& Path(Y) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.



Remark
By remark  it follows that in a TopTop-enriched model category, any enriched homotopy between maps X→YX\to Y is a left homotopy if XX is cofibrant and a right homotopy if YY is fibrant. Similar remarks hold for other enrichments.

For more see at homotopy in a model category.
In (co-)fibration categories
Clearly the concept of left homotopy in def.  only needs part of the model category axioms and thus makes sense more generally in suitable cofibration categories. Dually, the concept of path objects in def.  makes sense more generally in suitable fibration categories such as categories of fibrant objects in the sense of Brown.
Likewise if there is a cylinder functor, one gets functorially defined cylinder objects, etc.
In dependent type theory
In dependent type theory, let AA be a type and let PP be a type family indexed by AA, and let f,g:∏ x:AP(x)f,g:\prod_{x:A} P(x) be two elements of a dependent product type of a type family PP. The type of homotopies between ff and gg is the type
f∼g≡∏ x:A(f(x)= B(x)g(x))f \sim g \equiv \prod_{x:A} (f(x) =_{B(x)} g(x))
A homotopy between ff and gg is simply an element H:f∼gH:f \sim g.
Note that a homotopy is not the same as an identification f=gf = g. However this can be made so if one assumes function extensionality.
In formal logic such as type theory a term zz is an entity/expression of the formal language which is of some type ZZ. One writes z:Zz : Z to express this (a typing judgement). The semantics of terms in Set is: elements of a set, where one writes z∈Zz \in Z. One also says zz is an inhabitant of the type ZZ and that ZZ is an inhabited type if it has a term.
A term z:Zz : Z may depend on free variables xx that are themselves terms x:Xx : X of some other type XX. For instance z≔x+3z \coloneqq x + 3 may be a term of type Z≔ℤZ \coloneqq \mathbb{Z} (the integers) which depends on a variable term xx also of type X≔ℤX \coloneqq \mathbb{Z} the integers. The notation for this in the metalanguage is
x:X⊢z:Z.
  x : X \vdash z : Z
  \,.


Generally here also the type ZZ itself may depend on the variable xx (hence the term zz may be of different type depending on its free variables) in which case one says that zz is a term of XX-dependent type.
In the metalanguage of type theory called natural deduction, terms are what the term introduction rules produce.
Traditionally, a homotopy type is a topological space regarded up to weak homotopy equivalence, (although this may sometimes be referred to as its weak homotopy type, (see below)). Formally this may be taken to mean the object that XX represents in the standard homotopy category Ho(Top), or, better, in the (∞,1)-category ∞Grpd ≃\simeq L wheTopL_{whe} Top, the simplicial localization of the category Top at the weak homotopy equivalences, of which Ho(Top)Ho(Top) is the decategorification. As such, topological spaces regarded as homotopy types are equivalently ∞-groupoids (see at homotopy hypothesis for more on this).
More generally, then, we may think of every object in any (∞,1)-topos 𝒞\mathcal{C} as being a homotopy type in the world of 𝒞\mathcal{C} (just as we may think of an object of a 1-topos 𝒮\mathcal{S} as being a “set in the world of 𝒮\mathcal{S}”). For instance, if 𝒞=Sh ∞(C)\mathcal{C} = Sh_\infty(C) is an (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves/of ∞-stacks over some (∞,1)-site CC, then an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be thought of as a homotopy type over CC, or a sheaf of homotopy types. If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is the classifying topos of some geometric theory TT, then an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be called a “TT-structured homotopy type”. And if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos, an object of 𝒞\mathcal{C} may be called a “cohesive homotopy type”. In the special case that 𝒞=Sh ∞(*)≃∞Gprd\mathcal{C} = Sh_\infty(*) \simeq \infty Gprd, this reproduces the traditional notion.
The reason this makes sense is that any (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos has an internal language, which is homotopy type theory — a formal logic whose basic objects are abstract things called homotopy types, just as the basic objects of set theory are abstract things called sets. Inside the internal logic of 𝒞\mathcal{C}, its objects behave like classical homotopy types (although the ambient logic is constructive). This explains why we can think of objects of 𝒞\mathcal{C} as “homotopy types in the world of 𝒞\mathcal{C}”: they are the categorical semantics of these abstract homotopy types in the internal logic of 𝒞\mathcal{C}. In the special case of ∞Grpd\infty Grpd, the internal and external logic are the same, so this meaning also includes the classical usage of “homotopy type”.
Homotopy nn-types
A homotopy type that is an n-truncated object in an (∞,1)-category or equivalently that interprets a type of homotopy level n+2n+2 is also called a homotopy n-type or nn-type for short. For topological spaces / ∞-groupoids this means that all homotopy groups above degree nn are trivial.
Higher Lie theory is the refinement of Lie theory to higher geometry (higher differential geometry). It studies smooth ∞-groupoids and L-∞ algebroids and their relation via Lie integration and Lie differentiation.
What is called the “BRST complex” in the physics literature is the qDGCA which is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of the L ∞L_\infty-algebroid which is the differential version in Lie theory of the ∞\infty-groupoid


whose space of objects is the space of configurations/histories of a given physical system;


whose morphisms describe the gauge transformations between these configurations/histories;


whose kk-morphisms describe the kk-fold gauge-of-gauge transformations.


The generators of the BRST complex are called


in degree 0: fields;


in degree 1: ghost field;


in degree 2: ghost-of-ghost fields;


etc.


The cochain cohomology of the BRST complex is called, of course, BRST cohomology.
In gauge theory the configuration space/phase space is not in general a smooth space, but a smooth groupoid: the gauge transformations between gauge fields are the morphisms of this groupoid.
The infinitesimal approximation to this smooth groupoid is a Lie algebroid. The dg-algebra of functions on this is called the BRST complex of the gauge theory. It contains in degree-0 the (duals to) the gauge fields and in degree-1 the cotangents to the gauge transformations. These degree-1 elements that appear here alongside the physical fields in degree 0 are called ghost fields in the physics literature.
If there are higher gauge transformations “gauge-of-gauge transformations” then the BRST complex has generators in higher degree, too, the cotangents to these higher gauge transformations. These are then called ghost-of-ghost fields.
For more details and further pointers see at BRST complex and in particular at BV-BRST formalism.
In many categories CC in which one does homotopy theory, there is a notion of homotopy between morphisms, which is closely related to the 2-morphisms in higher category theory: a homotopy between two morphisms is a way in which they are equivalent.
If we regard such a category as a presentation of an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category, then homotopies f∼gf\sim g present the 2-cells f⇒gf\Rightarrow g in the resulting (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category.
In topological spaces

Definition
For f,g:X⟶Yf,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y two continuous functions between topological spaces X,YX,Y, then a left homotopy
η:f⇒ Lg
  \eta \colon f \,\Rightarrow_L\, g


is a continuous function
η:X×I⟶Y
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y


out of the standard cylinder object over XX: the product space of XX with the Euclidean closed interval I≔[0,1]I \coloneqq [0,1], such that this fits into a commuting diagram of the form


X  (id,δ 0)↓ ↘ f X×I ⟶η Y  (id,δ 1)↑ ↗ g X.
  \array{
     X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_0)}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{f}}
     \\
     X \times I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& Y
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{(id,\delta_1)}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
     \\
     X
  }
  \,.

Example
Let XX be a topological space and let x,y∈Xx,y \in X be two of its points, regarded as functions x,y:*⟶Xx,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X from the point to XX. Then a left homotopy, def. , between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form
*  δ 0↓ ↘ x I ⟶η X  δ 1↑ ↗ y *.
  \array{
     \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x}}
     \\
     I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{y}}
     \\
     \ast
  }
  \,.


This is simply a continuous path in XX whose endpoints are xx and yy.

In enriched categories
If CC is enriched over Top, then a homotopy in CC between maps f,g:X⇉Yf,g:X\,\rightrightarrows \,Y is a map H:[0,1]→C(X,Y)H:[0,1] \to C(X,Y) in TopTop such that H(0)=fH(0)=f and H(1)=gH(1)=g. In TopTop itself this is the classical notion.
If CC has copowers, then an equivalent definition is a map [0,1]⊙X→Y[0,1]\odot X\to Y, while if it has powers, an equivalent definition is a map X→⋔([0,1],Y)X\to \pitchfork([0,1],Y).
There is a similar definition in a simplicially enriched category, replacing [0,1][0,1] with the 1-simplex Δ 1\Delta^1, with the caveat that in this case not all simplicial homotopies need be composable even if they match correctly. (This depends on whether or not all (2,1)-horns in the simplicial set, C(X,Y)C(X,Y), have fillers.) Likewise in a dg-category we can use the “chain complex interval” to get a notion of chain homotopy.
In model categories
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a model category, it has an intrinsic notion of homotopy determined by its factorizations. For more on the following see at homotopy in a model category.

Definition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a model category and X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object.

A path object Path(X)Path(X) for XX is a factorization of the diagonal ∇ X:X→X×X\nabla_X \colon X \to X \times X as

∇ X:X⟶∈WiPath(X)⟶(p 0,p 1)X×X.
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
   X \underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow} Path(X) \overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.


where X→Path(X)X\to Path(X) is a weak equivalence. This is called a good path object if in addition Path(X)→X×XPath(X) \to X \times X is a fibration.

A cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) for XX is a factorization of the codiagonal (or “fold map”) Δ X:X⊔X→X\Delta_X: X \sqcup X \to X as

Δ X:X⊔X⟶(i 0,i 1)Cyl(X)⟶p∈WX.
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \underoverset{p}{\in W}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.


where Cyl(X)→XCyl(X) \to X is a weak equivalence. This is called a good cylinder object if in addition X⊔X→Cyl(X)X \sqcup X \to Cyl(X) is a cofibration.


Remark
By the factorization axioms every object in a model category has both a good path object and as well as a good cylinder object according to def. . But in some situations one is genuinely interested in using non-good such objects.
For instance in the classical model structure on topological spaces, the obvious object X×[0,1]X\times [0,1] is a cylinder object, but not a good cylinder unless XX itself is cofibrant (a cell complex in this case).
More generally, the path object Path(X)Path(X) of def.  is analogous to the powering ⋔(I,X)\pitchfork(I,X) with an interval object and the cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) is analogous to the tensoring I⊙XI\odot X with an interval object. In fact, if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a VV-enriched model category and XX is fibrant/cofibrant, then these powers and copowers are in fact examples of (good) path and cylinder objects if the interval object is sufficiently good.


Definition
Let f,g:X⟶Yf,g \colon X \longrightarrow Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.

A left homotopy η:f⇒ Lg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_L g is a morphism η:Cyl(X)⟶Y\eta \colon Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y from a cylinder object of XX, def. , such that it makes this diagram commute:

X ⟶ Cyl(X) ⟵ X   f↘ ↓ η ↙ g   Y.
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& Cyl(X) &\longleftarrow& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow &\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    && 
    Y
  }
  \,.



A right homotopy η:f⇒ Rg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_R g is a morphism η:X→Path(Y)\eta \colon X \to Path(Y) to some path object of XX, def. , such that this diagram commutes:

  X   f↙ ↓ η ↘ g Y ⟵ Path(Y) ⟶ Y.
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} 
    \\
    Y &\longleftarrow& Path(Y) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.



Remark
By remark  it follows that in a TopTop-enriched model category, any enriched homotopy between maps X→YX\to Y is a left homotopy if XX is cofibrant and a right homotopy if YY is fibrant. Similar remarks hold for other enrichments.

For more see at homotopy in a model category.
In (co-)fibration categories
Clearly the concept of left homotopy in def.  only needs part of the model category axioms and thus makes sense more generally in suitable cofibration categories. Dually, the concept of path objects in def.  makes sense more generally in suitable fibration categories such as categories of fibrant objects in the sense of Brown.
Likewise if there is a cylinder functor, one gets functorially defined cylinder objects, etc.
In dependent type theory
In dependent type theory, let AA be a type and let PP be a type family indexed by AA, and let f,g:∏ x:AP(x)f,g:\prod_{x:A} P(x) be two elements of a dependent product type of a type family PP. The type of homotopies between ff and gg is the type
f∼g≡∏ x:A(f(x)= B(x)g(x))f \sim g \equiv \prod_{x:A} (f(x) =_{B(x)} g(x))
A homotopy between ff and gg is simply an element H:f∼gH:f \sim g.
Note that a homotopy is not the same as an identification f=gf = g. However this can be made so if one assumes function extensionality.
By intensional type theory one means (but see Rem. ) the flavor of type theory in which identity types are not forced to be mere propositions (that is: not necessarily (-1)-truncated).
The original definition of identity types in Martin-Löf dependent type theory [Martin-Löf (1975, §1.7 and p. 94)] is by default intensional: It takes an additional axiom or rule — the identity reflection rule, cf. Streicher (1993, p. 4, 13 ); Hofmann (1995, p. 16) — to turn intensional into extensional type theory (in which identity types are then truncated to mere propositions).
In particular, homotopy type theory is intensional: the categorical semantics of its identity types are path space objects.


Remark
(terminology)  Beware that some authors take the words “intensional type theory” to refer to type theories which fail to satisfy function extensionality. This is in general a requirement orthogonal to the (-1)-truncation of identity types.
Generally, the origin of the names “extensional” and “intensional” is somewhat confusing. Even where the term refers to the behaviour of equality, it in fact refers not to the typal equality expressed by identity types, but to judgmental equality:
The idea is that the identity type is always an “extensional” notion of equality (although it can be more or less extensional, depending on whether further extensionality principles like function extensionality and univalence hold). Thus, if the judgmental equality coincides with the identity type, then the former is also extensional, whence the type theory is called “extensional” — while if the two equalities do not coincide, then the judgmental equality has room to be more intensional than the identity type, making the type theory “intensional” (but see also Hofmann (1995, ftn. 3), p. 17).
(On this historical reading, “extensional type theory” should refer only to judgmentally extensional type theory with the reflection rule, which is much stronger than merely requiring all types to be h-sets.)


Decidability
Only the intensional but not the extensional Martin-Löf type theory has decidable type checking. (Martin-Löf 75, Hofmann 95).
In physics there are (at least) two different concepts that go by the name gauge group:


a local gauge group GG is a structure group of GG-principal bundles in the configuration space of a classical gauge theory: it acts by gauge transformations on the space of field configurations.


a global gauge group is a group of automorphisms that acts on the (local net of) observables of a quantum field theory.


Notably after quantization the gauge group in the first sense does not become a gauge group in the second sense. On the contrary, observables in quantum field theory are required not to depend on gauge transformations in the first sense, and part of what makes quantization of gauge theory nontrivial is to find among all potential candidate observables those that actually are invariant under gauge transformations, i.e. under isomorphisms of principal bundles with connection in the configuration space of the gauge theory.
Global gauge group
The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in quantum field theory, where the gauge group of a physical system is the group of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable physical effects. In this sense, nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of gauge theories.
In AQFT gauge groups are introduced via a net of C-star-systems.
Local gauge groups
In Yang-Mills theory and other gauge theories the gauge groups is the structure group GG of the GG-principal bundle on which the Yang-Mills field is a connection.
Local gauge groups are visible in the Lagrangian approach to quantum field theory, where they act on the configuration space on which the action functional is a function by gauge transformations. A large machinery has been developed to handle the (path integral) quantization of action functionals on such configuration spaces. See for instance BV-BRST formalism.
We list examples of local gauge groups and ∞-groups for various higher gauge theories.


the gauge group of GG-Yang-Mills theory is the given Lie group GG; for the Yang-Mills theory appearing in the standard model of particle physics this is the unitary group U(3)×SU(2)×U(1)U(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1);


the local gauge group of gravity on a manifold XX is the Poincare group;


the gauge 2-group of the Kalb-Ramond field is the circle 2-group BU(1)=(U(1)→1)\mathbf{B} U(1) = (U(1) \to 1);


the gauge 3-group of the supergravity C-field is the circle 3-group B 2U(1)=(U(1)→1→1)\mathbf{B}^2 U(1) = (U(1) \to 1 \to 1);


the gauge group of abelian higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34 k+3 is the circle (2k+1)-group B 2kU(1)\mathbf{B}^{2k} U(1);


the 7-dimensional “fivebrane Chern-Simons theory” has as gauge 2-group the string 2-group;


the symmetry group of string field theory is some ∞-group that is not an nn-group for any finite nn;


an ∞-Chern-Simons theory has in general not only a gauge ∞-group but an ∞-groupoid of symmetries:


the Poisson sigma-model has as gauge groupoid the symplectic groupoid that is the Lie integration of the given Poisson Lie algebroid;


the Courant sigma-model has as gauge 2-groupoid the symplectic 2-groupoid that integrates the given Courant Lie 2-algebroid;


generally, the AKSZ sigma-model in grade nn has as gauge ∞\infty-groupoid a symplectic Lie n-groupoid.

In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Semantics is the interpretation of the syntax of a theory in a model.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.

In the (∞,1)-topos Top the construction of a loop space of a given topological space is familiar.
This construction may be generalized to any other (∞,1)-topos and in fact to any other (∞,1)-category with homotopy pullbacks.
Loop space objects are defined in any (∞,1)-category C\mathbf{C} with homotopy pullbacks: for XX any pointed object of C\mathbf{C} with point *→X{*} \to X, its loop space object is the homotopy pullback ΩX\Omega X of this point along itself:
ΩX → * ↓  ↓ * → X.
  \array{
    \Omega X &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& X
  }
  \,.


A (generalised) element of ΩX\Omega X may be thought of as a loop in XX at the base point **.
When the point x:*→Xx : {*} \to X is not clear from context, we can write Ω xX\Omega_x X or Ω(X,x)\Omega(X,x) to indicate the point.
Remarks
Since C(X,−)\mathbf{C}(X,-) commutes with homotopy limits, one has a natural homotopy equivalence Ω y¯C(X,Y)≃C(X,Ω yY)\Omega_{\bar{y}}\mathbf{C}(X,Y)\simeq \mathbf{C}(X,\Omega_y Y), for any objects XX and pointed object (Y,y)(Y,y) in C\mathbf{C}, where y¯\bar{y} denotes the morphism X→*→YX \to * \to Y.

fibration sequence


delooping


stable (∞,1)-category


An ∞-group is a group object in ∞Grpd.
Equivalently (by the delooping hypothesis) it is a pointed connected ∞\infty-groupoid.
Under the identification of ∞Grpd with Top this is known as a grouplike A ∞A_\infty-space, for instance.
An ∞\infty-Lie group is accordingly a group object in ∞-Lie groupoids. And so on.
For details see groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category.
An (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback is a limit in an (∞,1)-category 𝒞\mathcal{C} over a diagram of the shape
{a→c←b}→𝒞.
  \{a \to c \leftarrow b\} \to \mathcal{C}
  \,.


In other words it is a cone
A× CB → B ↓ ≅⇙ ↓ A → C
  \array{
    A \times_C B &\to& B
    \\
    \downarrow &\cong\swArrow& \downarrow
    \\
    A &\to& C
  }


which is universal among all such cones in the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categorical sense.
This is the analog in (∞,1)-category theory of the notion of pullback in category theory.
A homotopy fiber sequence is a “long left-exact sequence” in an (∞,1)-category. (The dual concept is that of cofiber sequence.)
Traditionally fiber sequences have been considered in the context of homotopical categories such as model categories and Brown category of fibrant objects which present the (∞,1)-category in question. In particular, classically this was considered for Top itself. In these cases they are obtained in terms of homotopy pullbacks. Since, as discussed there, the homotopy fiber of a morphism may be computed as the ordinary 1-categorical fiber of any fibration resolution of this morphism, one often also speaks of fibration sequences.
In a restrictive sense, a homomorphism is a function between (the underlying sets) of two algebras that preserves the algebraic structure.
More generally, a homomorphism is a function between structured sets that preserves whatever structure there is around. Even more generally, ‘homomorphism’ is just a synonym for ‘morphism’ in any category, the structured sets being generalised to arbitrary objects.
Note: The word “homomorphism” has also traditionally been used for what we call a (weak) 2-functor between bicategories.
The concept of smooth ∞\infty-stack is essentially that of


smooth ∞-groupoid.


∞-orbifold.


Following the logic described at


motivation for sheaves, cohomology and higher stacks


(∞,1)-topos


a smooth ∞\infty-stack is the ∞-categorification of smooth space and differentiable stack. It is an ∞-stack on the (essentially small) site Diff of smooth manifolds, or correspondingly on Ball⊂DiffBall \subset Diff or CartSp ⊂Diff\subset Diff (see smooth space for more on that).
So smooth ∞\infty-stacks are the objects in the (∞,1)-topos that computes smooth generalized cohomology. (See differential nonabelian cohomology and the disucssion under “Models” below for more on that).
Let CartSp={(ℝ n→ℝ m)∈Diff|n,m∈ℕ}⊂DiffCartSp = \{ (\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m) \in Diff| n,m \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset Diff be the full subcategory [of  on the  of the simple form , equipped with the standard structure of a  with the  given by  of manifolds.]
Then
Smooth∞Grpd:=(∞,1)Sh(CartSp)
  Smooth\infty Grpd := (\infty,1)Sh(CartSp)


is the (∞,1)-topos given by the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSpCartSp.
This is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd.

General
A spacetime is a manifold that models space and time in physics.
This is formalized by saying that a spacetime is a smooth Lorentzian space (X,μ)(X,\mu) equipped with a time orientation (see there).
Hence a point in a spacetime is called an event.
In the context of classical general relativity a spacetime is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional. A connected Lorentzian manifold is either time orientable or it has a two-sheeted covering which is time orientable.
In classical physics, notably in special relativity and general relativity points in XX model coordinates where events can take place from the viewpoint of an observer (“points in space and time”) while the metric μ\mu models the field of gravity in general relativity.
Intermingling of space and time
The noun “spacetime” is used in both special relativity and general relativity, but is best motivated from the viewpoint of general relativity. Special relativity deals with the Minkowski spacetime only. The Minkowski spacetime allows a canonical choice of global coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.
Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined canonical time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the physical interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates changes over the domain of definition.
(TODO: references and explanations).
In physics there are (at least) two different concepts that go by the name gauge group:


a local gauge group GG is a structure group of GG-principal bundles in the configuration space of a classical gauge theory: it acts by gauge transformations on the space of field configurations.


a global gauge group is a group of automorphisms that acts on the (local net of) observables of a quantum field theory.


Notably after quantization the gauge group in the first sense does not become a gauge group in the second sense. On the contrary, observables in quantum field theory are required not to depend on gauge transformations in the first sense, and part of what makes quantization of gauge theory nontrivial is to find among all potential candidate observables those that actually are invariant under gauge transformations, i.e. under isomorphisms of principal bundles with connection in the configuration space of the gauge theory.

the gauge group of GG-Yang-Mills theory is the given Lie group GG; for the Yang-Mills theory appearing in the standard model of particle physics this is the unitary group U(3)×SU(2)×U(1)U(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1);

In the original and restricted sense, S-duality refers to the conjectured Montonen-Olive duality auto-equivalence of (super) Yang-Mills theory in 4 dimensions under which the coupling constant is inverted, and more generally under which the combined coupling constant and theta angle tranform under an action of the modular group. At least for super Yang-Mills theory this conjecture can be argued for in detail.
There is also a duality in string theory called S-duality. Specifically in type IIB superstring theory/F-theory this is given by an action of the modular group on the axio-dilaton, hence is, via the proportionality of the dilaton to the string coupling constant, again a weak-strong coupling duality.
Indeed, at least for super Yang-Mills theory Montonen-Olive S-duality may be understood as a special case of the string duality (Witten 95a, Witten 95b): one may understand N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory as the KK-compactification of the M5-brane 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT on the F-theory torus (Johnson 97) to get the D3-brane worldvolume theory, and the remnant modular group action on the compactified torus is supposed to be the 4d Montonen-Olive S-duality (Witten 07).
In (super) Yang-Mills theory
General idea
In its original form, S-duality refers to Montonen-Olive duality , which is about the following phenomenon:
The Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory has two summands,
S YM:∇↦∫ X1e 2⟨F ∇∧⋆F ∇⟩+∫ Xiθ⟨F ∇∧F ∇⟩,
  S_{YM} : \nabla \mapsto \int_X \frac{1}{e^2} \langle F_\nabla \wedge \star F_\nabla\rangle
   + \int_{X} i \theta \langle F_\nabla \wedge F_\nabla \rangle
  \,,


each pairing the curvature 2-form with itself in an invariant polynomial, but the first involving the Hodge star operator dual, and the second not. One can combine the coefficients 1e 2\frac{1}{e^2} and iθi \theta into a single complex coupling constant
τ=θ2π+4πie 2.
  \tau = \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} +  \frac{4 \pi i}{e^2}
  \,.


Montonen-Olive duality asserts that the quantum field theories induced from one such parameter value and another one obtained from it by an action of SL(2,Z) on the upper half plane are equivalent.
This is actually not quite true for ordinary Yang-Mills theory, but seems to be true for N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory.
From compactification of the 6d (2,0)-SCFT and AGT correspondence
In (Witten 95a, Witten 95b, Witten 07) it was suggested that the above S-duality of N=2 D=4 super Yang-Mills theory may be understood geometrically by regarding the super Yang-Mills theory as the Kaluza-Klein compactification of the 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT – that instead of a gauge field given by a principal bundle with connection involves a principal 2-bundle with 2-connection – on a complex torus. The SL(2,ℤ)SL(2,\mathbb{Z})-invariance of the resulting 4-dimensional theory is then the modular group remnant of the conformal invariance of the 6-dimensional theory under conformal transformations of that torus.
Moreover, Witten has suggested that this S-duality secretly drives a host of other subtle phenomena, notably that the geometric Langlands duality (see there for more) is just an aspect of a special case of this.
The AGT correspondence refines this further and regards the 6d (2,0)-superconformal QFT as something like a “2d SCFT with values in 4d super-Yang-Mills theories”. This way the whole mapping class group of general 2d Riemann surfaces acts as a generalized S-duality on 4d super-Yang-Mills theory
In string theory
In string theory, S-duality is supposed to apply to whole string theories and make type II string theory be S-dual to itself and make heterotic string theory be S-dual to type I string theory.
Type IIB S-duality
General idea
Type IIB string theory is obtained by KK-compactification of M-theory on a torus bundle followed by T-dualizing one of the torus cycles. This perspective – referred to as F-theory – exhibits the axio-dilaton of type IIB string theory as the fiber of an elliptic fibration (essentially the torus bundle that M-theory was compactified on (Johnson 97)).
The modular group acts on this elliptic fibration, and this is S-duality for type IIB-strings. In particular the transformation τ↦−1τ\tau \mapsto - \frac{1}{\tau} inverts the type II coupling constant. See at F-theory for more.
The type IIB F1-string and the D1-brane appear this way by double dimensional reduction from the M2-brane wrapping (either) one of the two cycles of the compactifying torus. S-duality mixes these strings by the evident modular group action on the (p,q)∈ℤ 2(p,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^2 labels of the (p,q)-strings. Here at least part of the S-duality action on (p,q)(p,q)-strings may be seen as a system of autoequivalences of the super L-infinity algebras which defines the extended super spacetime constituted by the type II superstring (Bandos 00, FSS 13, section 4.3).
Similarly the D5-brane and the NS5-brane are the double dimensional reduction of the M5-brane wrapping one of the two cycles of the compactifying torus, and hence the S-duality modular group also acts on (p,q)(p,q)-5-branes, exchanging them.
Finally, the D3-brane is instead the double dimensional reduction of the M5-brane, wrapping both compactifying dimensions. Accordingly the worldvolume theory of the D3, which is super Yang-Mills theory in d=4d = 4 has an S-self-duality. That is supposed to be the Montonen-Olive duality discussed above, which is thereby unified with type IIB S-duality.
Cohomological nature of type II fields under S-duality
While F-theory does capture much of this non-perturbative S-duality, there currently remains a puzzle as to the correct differential cohomology nature of all the fields under S-duality: by the above S-duality mixes the Kalb-Ramond field B^ NS\hat B_{NS} with the degree-3 component B^ RR\hat B_{RR} of the RR-field. But the best available description of the fine-structure of these fields is (see also at orientifold) that B^ NS\hat B_{NS} is a cocycle in (twisted) ordinary differential cohomology while B^ RR\hat B_{RR} is (only) one component of a cocycle in (twisted) KU (or really: KR-theory).
This issue was first highlighted in (DMW 00, section 11). In (DFM 03, section 9) it was observed that taking into account the cubical structure in M-theory on the 11-dimensional Chern-Simons term of the supergravity C-field the conceptual mismatch is alleviated, but not quite resolved. See also (BEJVS 05)
On the other hand, as discussed at cubical structure in M-theory, this structure plausibly relates to a generalized cohomology theory beyond ordinary cohomology and beyond K-theory, namely to elliptic cohomology/tmf. Hints like this led in (KrizSati 05) to the conjecture that the right cohomology theory to capture the S-duality of type IIB/F-theory is modular equivariant elliptic cohomology.
Heterotic/type I duality

Something substantial should go here, for the moment the following is copied from a discussion forum comment by some Olof here:

For the Het/I relation, the first observation is that the massless spectra of the two models agree. Moreover, if we make the identification
G μν I=e −Φ hG μν h,Φ I=−Φ h,F˜ 3 I=H˜ 3 h,A 1 I=A 1 h
G^I_{\mu\nu} = e^{-\Phi_h} G^h_{\mu\nu} , \qquad
\Phi^I = - \Phi^h , \qquad
\tilde{F}^I_3 = \tilde{H}^h_3 , \qquad
A^I_1 = A^h_1


the low energy effective supergravity actions of the two models match. Since the string coupling constants g s Ig_s^I and g s hg_s^h are given as the expectation values of the exponentials of the dilatons exp(Φ I)\exp(\Phi^I) and exp(Φ h)\exp(\Phi^h), respectively, the above equations relates the type-I theory at strong coupling to the heterotic theory at weak coupling:
g s I=1g s h.
g^I_s = \frac{1}{g^h_s} .


From the relative scaling of the metric in (1) we also see that the string length in the two theories are related by
l s I=l s hg s h.
l^I_s = l^h_s \sqrt{g^h_s}.


As a non-perturbative check we can consider the tension of the type-I D1 brane. The brane is a BPS object, so for all values of the coupling g s Ig_s^I the tension is given by the same formula
T D1 I=1g s I12π(l s I) 2=g s h2π(l s hg s h) 2=12π(l s h) 2
T^I_{D1} = \frac{1}{g_s^I} \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^I_s\right)^2} = \frac{g^h_s}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\sqrt{g^h_s}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\right)^2}


where I’ve used relations (2) and (3). But this is equal to the tension of the fundamental heterotic string
T F1 h=12π(l s h) 2.
T^h_{F1} = \frac{1}{2\pi\left(l^h_s\right)^2}.


This indicates that it is sensible to identify the strong coupling limit of the type-I D1 brane with the heterotic string.
For type IIA
A priori type IIA superstring theory does not have S-duality, but by compactifying M-theory on a torus one can sort of read off what the non-perturbative additions to type IIA should be that make it have S-duality after all, see

Gottfried Curio, Boris Kors, Dieter Lüst, Fluxes and Branes in Type II Vacua and M-theory Geometry with G(2) and Spin(7) Holonomy, Nucl.Phys.B636:197-224,2002 (arXiv:hep-th/0111165)

Seiberg duality (named after (Seiberg)) is a version of electric-magnetic duality in supersymmetric gauge theory.
For supersymmetric QCD it identifies in the infrared (long distance limit, and only there) the quarks and gluons in a theory with N fN_f quark flavors and SU(N c)SU(N_c) gauge group for
N f>N c+1
  N_f \gt N_c +1


with solitons in a theory of N fN_f quark flavors and gauge group SU(N˜ c)SU(\tilde N_c), where
N˜ c=N f−N c.
  \tilde N_c = N_f - N_c 
  \,.


Realization in string theory
Seiberg duality follows from phenomena in string theory, where gauge theories arise as the worldvolume theories of D-branes (geometric engineering of quantum field theory). Seiberg duality is obtained for gauge theories of D-branes that stretch between two NS5-branes. The duality operation corresponds to exchanging the two NS5-branes.

A supersymmetric extension of plain Yang-Mills theory.
Classification
The existence of super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories of a certain number of supersymmetries in a certain dimension of spacetime is linked to the existence of certain cocycles on the super Poincaré Lie algebra (those that also govern the brane scan). These in turn are closely related to the normed division algebras. See (ABDH 13). See also at division algebra and supersymmetry.
This classification may be paired with that for supergravity theories, to yield a magic pyramid of super Einstein-Yang-Mills theories.
In general two objects are considered equivalent if they may be replaced by one another in all contexts under consideration (see also the principle of equivalence).
At the propositional level, the general theory of equivalence is discussed at equivalence relation, but that leaves us with the question of the correct definition of equivalence in various situations. Furthermore, we can work on a higher level and ask what the equivalences are, not just whether things are equivalent.
In fundamental physics, notably in quantum field theory and string theory one often says that a non-trivial equivalence of quantum field theories between two models (in theoretical physics) is a “duality”.
A bijection is an isomorphism in Set.
Since Set is a balanced category, bijections can also be characterized as functions which are both injective (monic) and surjective (epic).
Given sets AA and BB, a function f:A→Bf:A \to B is a bijection if it comes with an inverse function f −1:B→Af^{-1}:B \to A such that for all elements b∈Bb \in B, f(f −1(b))=bf(f^{-1}(b)) = b and for all elements a∈Aa \in A, if f(a)=bf(a) = b, then a=f −1(b)a = f^{-1}(b)
∀b∈B.(f(f −1(b))=b∧∀a∈A.(f(a)=b⇒a=f −1(b)))\forall b \in B.(f(f^{-1}(b)) = b \wedge \forall a \in A.(f(a) = b \implies a = f^{-1}(b)))
The condition that f(f −1(b))=bf(f^{-1}(b)) = b could also be made more general, by any element a:Aa:A such that a=f −1(b)a = f^{-1}(b). This then becomes
∀a∈A.∀b∈B.((a= Af −1(b))⇒(f(a)= Bb))∧((f(a)= Bb)⇒(a= Af −1(b))\forall a \in A.\forall b \in B.((a =_A f^{-1}(b)) \implies (f(a) =_B b)) \wedge ((f(a) =_B b) \implies (a =_A f^{-1}(b))
This could be simplified down to the statement that f(a)=bf(a) = b if and only if a=f −1(b)a = f^{-1}(b).
∀a∈A.∀b∈B.((f(a)= Bb)⇔(a= Af −1(b))\forall a \in A.\forall b \in B.((f(a) =_B b) \iff (a =_A f^{-1}(b))
This is an adjoint equivalence between two thin univalent groupoids.
A homotopy fiber sequence is a “long left-exact sequence” in an (∞,1)-category. (The dual concept is that of cofiber sequence.)
Traditionally fiber sequences have been considered in the context of homotopical categories such as model categories and Brown category of fibrant objects which present the (∞,1)-category in question. In particular, classically this was considered for Top itself. In these cases they are obtained in terms of homotopy pullbacks. Since, as discussed there, the homotopy fiber of a morphism may be computed as the ordinary 1-categorical fiber of any fibration resolution of this morphism, one often also speaks of fibration sequences.
For topological spaces
A topological space XX is contractible if the canonical map X→*X \to \ast is a homotopy equivalence. It is weakly contractible if this map is a weak homotopy equivalence, hence if all homotopy groups of XX are trivial.
Where the Whitehead theorem does not apply, we may find examples of weakly contractible but not contractible spaces, such as the double comb space in Top.
For ∞\infty-groupoids
Since the Whitehead theorem applies in ∞Grpd (and generally in any hypercomplete (∞,1)-topos), being weakly equivalent to the point is the same as there being a contraction. So an ∞-groupoid is weakly contractible if and only if it is contractible.
(Cis weakly contractible)⇔(C→≃*).
  (C \;\text{is weakly contractible}) \Leftrightarrow
  (C \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} *)
  \,.


In this context one tends to drop the “weakly” qualifier.
Sometimes one allows also the empty object ∅\emptyset to be contractible. To distinguish this, we say


an ∞\infty-groupoid is (-1)-truncated (is a (-1)-groupoid) if it is either empty or equivalent to the point;


an ∞\infty-groupoid is (-2)-truncated (is a (-2)-groupoid) if it is equivalent to the point.


For cohesive ∞\infty-groupoids
Cohesive 


∞

\infty

-groupoids could be contractible in two different ways: topologically contractible in the first sense, or homotopically contractible in the second sense. A cohesive ∞\infty-groupoid SS is homotopically contractible if its underlying ∞\infty-groupoid Γ(S)\Gamma(S) is contractible. A cohesive ∞\infty-groupoid is topologically contractible if its fundamental infinity-groupoid Π(S)\Pi(S) is contractible. These two notions of contractibility are not equivalent to each other: in Euclidean-topological infinity-groupoids the unit interval is topologically contractible, but homotopically the unit interval is only 0-truncated.
A weak homotopy equivalence is a map between topological spaces or simplicial sets or similar which induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups. (The analogous concept in homological algebra is called a quasi-isomorphism.)
The localization or simplicial localization of the categories Top and sSet at the weak homotopy equivalences used as weak equivalences yields the standard homotopy category Ho(Top) and Ho(sSet) or the (∞,1)-category of ∞-groupoids/homotopy types, respectively.
Weak homotopy equivalences are named after homotopy equivalences. They can be identified with homotopy equivalences after one allows to replace the domains by a resolution. The corresponding notions in homological algebra are quasi-isomorphisms and chain homotopy-equivalences.
From another perspective, the notion of weak homotopy equivalence is ‘observational’, in that a map is a weak homotopy equivalence if when we look at it through the observations that we can make of it using homotopy groups or even the fundamental infinity-groupoid, it looks like an equivalence. In contrast, homotopy equivalence is more ‘constructive’; in that ff is a homotopy equivalence if there exists an inverse for it (up to homotopy, of course). Note that both of these notions are weaker than mere isomorphism of topological spaces (homeomorphism) and so can be considered examples of weak equivalences.
There are actually two related concepts here: whether two spaces are weakly homotopy equivalent and whether a map between spaces is a weak homotopy equivalence. The former is usually defined in terms of the latter.
Equivalent characterizations

In this form the statement and its proof appears in (Jardine) (where it is also generalized to weak equivalences in a model structure on simplicial presheaves). See also around (Lurie, prop. 6.5.2.1). The relevant arguments are spelled out in (May, section 9.6). A variant is called the HELP lemma in (Vogt).
Relation to homotopy equivalences

Proposition
Every homotopy equivalence is a weak homotopy equivalence.


Proof
It requires a little bit of thought to prove this, because ff and its homotopy inverse gg need not preserve any chosen basepoint. But for any x∈Xx\in X and any n≥1n\ge 1, we have a commuting diagram
π n(X,x)  →  π n(X,g(f(x)))  ↘  ↗  ↘   π n(Y,f(x))  ⟶  π n(Y,f(g(f(x))))
\array{
  \pi_n(X,x) & & \to & & \pi_n(X,g(f(x)))
  \\
  & 
  \searrow 
  && 
  \nearrow 
  && 
  \searrow
  \\
  && 
  \pi_n(Y,f(x)) 
  && 
  \longrightarrow 
  && 
  \pi_n\big(
    Y,f(g(f(x)))
  \big)
  }


in which the two horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms, because gfg f and fgf g are homotopic to identities. Hence, by the two-out-of-six property for isomorphisms, the diagonal morphhisms are also all isomorphisms.


Proposition
Conversely, any weak homotopy equivalence between m-cofibrant spaces (spaces that are homotopy equivalent to CW complexes) is a homotopy equivalence.

Relation to homotopy types
We discuss the equivalence relation generated by weak homotopy equivalence, called (weak) homotopy type. For the “abelianized” analog of this situation see at quasi-isomorphism the section Relation to homology type.

Proposition
The existence of a weak homotopy equivalence from XX to YY is a reflexive and transitive relation on Top, but it is not a symmetric relation.


Proof
Reflexivity and transitivity are trivially checked. A counterexample to symmetry is example  below.

But we can consider the genuine equivalence relation generated by weak homotopy equivalence:

Definition
We say two spaces XX and YY have the same (weak) homotopy type if they are equivalent under the equivalence relation generated by weak homotopy equivalence.


Remark
Equivalently this means that XX and YY have the same (weak) homotopy type if there exists a zigzag of weak homotopy equivalences
X←→←…→Y.
  X \leftarrow \to\leftarrow \dots \to Y
  \,.


This in turn is equivalent to saying that XX and YY become isomorphic in the homotopy category Ho(Top)/Ho(sSet) with the weak homotopy equivalences inverted.


Remark
Two spaces XX and YY may have isomorphic homotopy groups without being weak homotopy equivalence: for this all the isomorphisms must be induced by an actual map f:X→Yf : X \to Y, as in the above definition.
However, if, roughly, one remembers, how all the homotopy groups act on each other, then this is enough information to exhibit the full homotopy type. This collection of data is called the Postnikov tower decomposition of a homotopy type.

Relation to free homotopy sets
For K,X∈TopSpK, X \,\in\, TopSp, write Map(K,X)Map(K, X) for their mapping space, i.e. not considering or respecting any basepoint. For example, Map(S 1,Y)Map(S^1, Y) is the free loop space of YY, in contrast to the based loop space
Ω xX↪fib x(ev *)Map(S 1,X)↠ev xX
  \Omega_x X 
    \xhookrightarrow{\; fib_x(ev_\ast) \;} 
  Map(S^1, X) 
    \overset{\; ev_x \;}{\twoheadrightarrow}
  X


for any base point x∈Xx \,\in\, X.
Moreover, when KK is a CW complex, write
(1)[K,X]≔τ 0Map(K,X)
  
  {[K,X]} \,\coloneqq\, \tau_0 \,Map(K,X)\,


for the free homotopy set of maps from KK to XX, hence the set of homotopy classes of map K→XK \to X, hence the set of connected components of the mapping space.


Proposition

 (Matumoto, Minami and Sugawara 1984, Thm. 2) 

Proof
The implication (1)⇒(2)(1) \Rightarrow (2) is a standard/classical conclusion in homotopy theory, for example it is a small special case of the fact that Map(K,−)Map(K,-) out of any cell complex KK preserves weak homotopy equivalences (this Prop.).
The implication (2)⇒(3)(2) \Rightarrow (3) is trivial, as the conditions in (3) are just a special case of the condition in (2).
So the point of the statement is that (3) is already sufficient to recover (1). This is the content of Matumoto, Minami and Sugawara 1984, Thm. 1 & Lem. 1.3.


In fundamental physics, notably in quantum field theory and string theory one often says that a non-trivial equivalence of quantum field theories between two models (in theoretical physics) is a “duality”.
In intensional type theory, identity types behave like path space objects; this viewpoint is called homotopy type theory. This induces furthermore a notion of homotopy fibers, hence of homotopy equivalences between types.
On the other hand, if type theory contains a universe Type, so that types can be considered as points of TypeType, then between two types we also have an identity type Paths Type(X,Y)Paths_{Type}(X,Y). The univalence axiom says that these two notions of “sameness” for types are the same.
Extensionality principles like function extensionality, propositional extensionality (where XX and YY are h-propositions, and univalence (“typal extensionality”) are naturally regarded as a stronger form of identity of indiscernibles. In particular, the consistency of univalence means that in Martin-Löf type theory without univalence, one cannot define any predicate that provably distinguishes isomorphic types; thus isomorphic types are “externally indiscernible”, and univalence incarnates that principle internally by making them identical.
The name univalence (due to Voevodsky) comes from the following reasoning. A fibration or bundle p:E→Bp\colon E\to B of some sort is commonly said to be universal if every other bundle of the same sort is a pullback of pp in a unique way (up to homotopy). Less commonly, a bundle is said to be versal if every other bundle is a pullback of it in some way, not necessarily unique. By contrast, a bundle is said to be univalent if every other bundle is a pullback of it in at most one way (up to homotopy). In the language of (∞,1)-category theory, a univalent bundle is an object classifier.
The univalence axiom does not literally say that anything is univalent in this sense. However, it is equivalent to saying that the canonical fibration over TypeType is univalent: every fibration with small fibers is an essentially unique pullback of this one (while those with large fibers are not, they are pullbacks of the next higher Type 1Type_1). For a description of this equivalence, see section 4.8 of the HoTT Book (syntactically) and Gepner-Kock (semantically).
Univalence is a commonly assumed axiom in homotopy type theory, and is central to the proposal (Voevodsky) that this provides a natively homotopy theoretic foundation of mathematics (see at univalent foundations for mathematics).
We work in a dependent type theory with identity types, function types, dependent product types, product types, and dependent sum types.
There are multiple notions of equivalence types in dependent type theory, which can be used for a definition of univalence for a type universe UU; these include

judgmentally strict equivalence types
propositionally strict equivalence types
various notions of weak equivalence types

the type of functions with contractible fibers
the type of spans with contractible fibers
the type of multivalued partial functions which are single-valued and total and have contractible fibers
the type of one-to-one correspondences


type of UU-small equivalences, given a type universe UU and a definition of equivalence above

Let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type ≃ 0\simeq_0. Every Russell universe UU is a reflexive graph with the graph type family R(A,B)R(A, B) defined as R(A,B)≔A≃ 0BR(A, B) \coloneqq A \simeq_0 B and the function idtofam(A,B)\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) is defined as
idtofam(A,B)≔idtoequiv(A,B)\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) \coloneqq \mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B)
Similarly, every Tarski universe (U,T)(U, T) is a reflexive graph with the graph type family R(A,B)R(A, B) defined as R(A,B)≔T(A)≃ 0T(B)R(A, B) \coloneqq T(A) \simeq_0 T(B) and the function idtofam(A,B)\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) is defined as
idtofam(A,B)≔transport T(A,B)\mathrm{idtofam}(A, B) \coloneqq \mathrm{transport}^T(A, B)
Now, let us assume an arbitrary notion of equivalence type ≃\simeq. A Russell or Tarski universe is univalent if it is univalent as a reflexive graph, or equivalently, if one of the following equivalent conditions by the fundamental theorem of identity types hold:


That for each x:Ax:A the type of elements y:Ay:A such that R(x,y)R(x, y) is a contractible type.
x:A⊢ua(x):isContr(∑ y:AR(x,y))x:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x):\mathrm{isContr}\left(\sum_{y:A} R(x, y)\right)

That there is a family of equivalences
x:A,y:A⊢ua(x,y):(x= Ay)≃R(x,y)x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):(x =_A y) \simeq R(x, y)

That R(x,y)R(x, y) is an identity system.


That for each x:Ax:A and y:Ay:A, the function idtofam(x,y)\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y) is an equivalence of types
x:A,y:A,⊢ua(x,y):isEquiv(idtofam(x,y))x:A, y:A, \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):\mathrm{isEquiv}(\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y))

That idtofam(x,y)\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y) is a retraction (This is due to Daniel Licata in Licata 16)
x:A,y:A⊢ua(x,y):R(x,y)→(x= Ay)x:A, y:A \vdash \mathrm{ua}(x, y):R(x, y) \to (x =_A y)x:A,y:A,r:R(x,y)⊢G(x,y):idtofam(x,y,ua(x,y,r))= R(x,y)rx:A, y:A, r:R(x, y) \vdash G(x, y):\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y, \mathrm{ua}(x, y, r)) =_{R(x, y)} r

That R(x,y)R(x, y) with the function idtofam(x,y)\mathrm{idtofam}(x, y) satisfies the universal property of the unary sum of x= Ayx =_A y.


See fundamental theorem of identity types for proofs that these definitions are the same.
Traditional homotopy type theory uses the type of functions with contractible fibers for both ≃\simeq and RR, while Mike Shulman‘s model of higher observational type theory uses the type of UU-small one-to-one correspondences for RR and the type of judgmentally strict equivalences for ≃\simeq.
Stricter versions of univalence
There are stricter versions of univalence, where we replace the equivalence of types between the identity type A= UBA =_U B and the type of equivalences of the universe A≃BA \simeq B in the univalence axioms with some notion of equality, such as judgmental equality, propositional equality, and typal equality.


In any dependent type theory with judgmental equality, given a type universe UU, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a judgmental equality of types. This results in judgmental univalence, which states that for all small types A:UA:U and B:UB:U, one could judge that (A= UB)≡(A≃B)type(A =_U B) \equiv (A \simeq B) \; \mathrm{type}.


Similarly, in the context of any logic over type theory with propositional equality, given a type universe UU, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a propositional equality of types. This results in propositional univalence, which states that for all small types A:UA:U and B:UB:U, (A= UB)≡(A≃B)true(A =_U B) \equiv (A \simeq B) \; \mathrm{true}.


Finally, if we are working inside a Tarski universe (𝒱,𝒯)(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{T}), then given an internal Tarski universe U:𝒱U:\mathcal{V} with T:𝒯(U)→𝒱T:\mathcal{T}(U) \to \mathcal{V}, one could replace the equivalence of types in the definition of univalence with a typal equality of types. This results in typal univalence, which states that for all small types A:𝒯(U)A:\mathcal{T}(U) and B:𝒯(U)B:\mathcal{T}(U), there is an identification ua(A,B):(T(A)= UT(B))= 𝒱(T(A)≃ 𝒱T(B))\mathrm{ua}(A, B):(T(A) =_U T(B)) =_{\mathcal{V}} (T(A) \simeq_{\mathcal{V}} T(B)).


Each of these imply the usual versions of univalence either through the structural rules for judgmental equality and propositional equality, or through identification elimination, transport, and action on identifications for typal equality.
Rules for judgmentally univalent universes
With judgmentally univalent Tarski universes (U,T)(U, T), identities p:A= UBp:A =_U B are equivalences of types AA and BB. Namely, given function types and the isEquiv type family, one could add rules to the type theory which says that A= UBA =_U B behaves as an equivalence type:
Introduction rules:
Γ⊢A:UΓ⊢B:UΓ,x:T[A/X]⊢f:T[B/X]Γ⊢y:isEquiv(f)Γ⊢equiv(f,y):A= UB\frac{\Gamma \vdash A:U \quad \Gamma \vdash B:U \quad \Gamma, x:T[A/X] \vdash f:T[B/X] \quad \Gamma \vdash y:\mathrm{isEquiv}(f)}{\Gamma \vdash \mathrm{equiv}(f, y):A =_U B}
Elimination rules:

Uniqueness rules:

Weaker versions of univalence
In the context of function extensionality, Ian Orton and Andrew Pitts showed here that the univalence axiom can be simplified to the following special cases:

unit:A=∑ a:A1unit : A = \sum_{a:A} 1
flip:(∑ a:A∑ b:BC(a,b))=(∑ b:B∑ a:AC(a,b))flip : (\sum_{a:A} \sum_{b:B} C(a,b)) = (\sum_{b:B} \sum_{a:A} C(a,b))
contract:IsContr(A)→(A=1)contract: IsContr(A) \to (A=1)
unit β:coe(unit(a))=(a,⋆)unit_\beta : coe(unit(a)) = (a,\star)
flip β:coe(flip(a,b,c))=(b,a,c)flip_\beta : coe(flip(a,b,c)) = (b,a,c).

The proof constructs ua(f):A=Bua(f): A=B (for f:A≃Bf:A\simeq B) as the composite
A=unit∑ a:A1=contract∑ a:A∑ b:Bfa=b=flip∑ b:B∑ a:Afa=b=contract∑ b:B1=unitB A \overset{unit}{=} \sum_{a:A} 1 \overset{contract}{=} \sum_{a:A} \sum_{b:B} f a=b \overset{flip}{=} \sum_{b:B} \sum_{a:A} f a = b \overset{contract}{=} \sum_{b:B} 1 \overset{unit}{=} B 
and uses unit βunit_\beta and flip βflip_\beta to compute that coe(ua(f))(a)=f(a)coe(ua(f))(a) = f(a), hence by function extensionality coe(ua(f))=fcoe(ua(f)) = f.
This is weaker than univalence because in the absense of function extensionality, it is no longer possible to prove univalence from this set of axioms.
In addition, unlike the definitions above, this definition of univalence cannot be generalized to reflexive graphs.
Internal univalence
Suppose the Tarski universe UU has

internal identity typesId U:∏ A:UT(A)×T(A)→U\mathrm{Id}^U:\prod_{A:U} T(A) \times T(A) \to U
internal dependent product typesΠ U(x:(−)).(−)(x):(U×∏ A:UT(A)→U)→U\Pi_U (x:(-)).(-)(x):\left(U \times \prod_{A:U} T(A) \to U\right) \to U
internal dependent sum typesΣ U(x:(−)).(−)(x):(U×∏ A:UT(A)→U)→U\Sigma_U (x:(-)).(-)(x):\left(U \times \prod_{A:U} T(A) \to U\right) \to U

We assume the weakest notion of Tarski universe, where the type reflection T(A)T(A) of each A:UA:U is only equivalent to the external type, since (judgmentally, propositionally, typally) strict Tarski universes are weakly Tarski universes, because the judgmental equality and propositional equality imply equivalence of types by the structural rules for judgmental and propostional equality, and typal equality in a type universe of types imply equivalence of types by identification elimination, transport, and action on identifications.
This allows us to define the internal type of equivalences A≃ U inBA \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B, internal to the universe UU, which comes with a canonical equivalence of types
canonical ≃(A,B):T(A≃ U inB)≃(T(A)≃T(B))\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, B):T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B) \simeq (T(A) \simeq T(B))
This implies that the equivalence T(A)≃T(B)T(A) \simeq T(B) is UU-small, and transport being an equivalence then implies that in any universe UU which is closed under function types, dependent product types, and dependent sum types, for all A:UA:U and B:UB:U, the identity type A= UBA =_U B is UU-small.
The internal univalence axiom states that the canonical function
idtointernalequiv(A,B):(A= UB)→T(A≃ U inB)\mathrm{idtointernalequiv}(A, B):(A =_U B) \to T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B)
is an equivalence of types
idtoequiv(A,B):(A= UB)≃T(A≃ U inB)\mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B):(A =_U B) \simeq T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} B)
This is not definable for strongly predicative type universes, since strongly predicative type universes are by definition not closed under dependent product types.
In addition, the internal and external versions of univalence imply each other. In order to show that the two axioms imply each other, we need to show that there is an identification
i(p):canonical ≃(A,B)(idtoequiv(A,B)(p))= T(A)≃T(B)trans T(A,B)(p)i(p):\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, B)(\mathrm{idtoequiv}(A, B)(p)) =_{T(A) \simeq T(B)}  \mathrm{trans}^{T}(A, B)(p)
for all identifications p:A= UBp:A =_U B. By the J rule it is enough to show that canonical ≃(A,A)\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq(A, A) maps the identity equivalence of T(A≃ U inA)T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} A) to the identity equivalence in T(A)≃T(A)T(A) \simeq T(A). Since the identity equivalence in T(A≃ U inA)T(A \simeq_U^\mathrm{in} A) is just the identity function canonical ≃ −1(A,A)(λx.x)\mathrm{canonical}_\simeq^{-1}(A, A)(\lambda x.x) the above statement is always true. Thus, if the universe is closed under identity types, dependent product types, and dependent sum types the two univalence axioms imply each other and both define the same notion of univalent universe.
Relation to function extensionality
The univalence axiom implies function extensionality.
A commented version of a formal proof of this fact can be found in (Bauer-Lumsdaine).
Univalence and axiom K
In this section we assume that the universe is a Tarski universe. Axiom K states that for all A:UA:U the type T(A)T(A) is a set. This means the type reflection of the internal equivalences T(A≃ UB)T(A \simeq_U B) is an h-set, and the univalence axiom then implies that UU is an h-groupoid.
It is frequently stated that the univalence axiom and axiom K are inconsistent with each other. However, this is only true if the Tarski universe UU has internal univalent Tarski universes V:UV:U where the type T(V)T(V) has terms A:T(V)A:T(V) such that T V(A)T_V(A) is an h-set which is not an h-proposition, such as the booleans type. As a result, T(V)T(V) can be proven to not be a set, causing axiom K for UU to be inconsistent with the existence of V:UV:U and univalence.
Canonicity and homotopy canonicity
It is currently open whether the univalence axiom enjoys canonicity in general, but for the special case of 1-truncated homotopy types (groupoids) (and two nested univalent universes and function extensionality), homotopy canonicity has been shown in (Shulman 12, section 13. Thus, in univalent homotopy 1-type theory with two universes, every term of type of the natural numbers is propositionally equal to a numeral.
The construction in (Shulman 12, section 13) uses Artin gluing of a suitable type-theoretic fibration category with the category Set and Grpd, respectively, effectively inducing canonicity from these categories. By (Shulman 12, remark 13.13) for this construction to generalize to untruncated univalent type theory, one seems to need a sufficiently strict global sections functor with values in some model for infinity-groupoids. A proof of the full result has been announced by Christian Sattler and Krzysztof Kapulkin (Sattler 19).
Notice that this sort of canonicity does not yet imply computational effectiveness?, which would require also an algorithm to extract that numeral from the given term. There may be such an algorithm, but so far attempts to extract one from the proof (or to give a constructive version of the proof, which would imply the existence of an algorithm) have not succeeded.
It is also a propositional canonicity, as opposed to the judgmental canonicity which many traditional type theories enjoy. Another approach to canonicity for 1-truncated univalence can be found in (Harper-Licata), which involves modifying the type theory by adding more judgmental equalities, resulting in a judgmental canonicity. However, no algorithm for computing canonical forms has yet been given for this approach either.
Canonicity has been proved for cubical type theory.
One might also try to construct the Hoffman-Streicher groupoid model in a constructive framework; Awodey and Bauer have done some work in this direction with an impredicative universe of h-sets.
A univalent universe inside a non-univalent universe
In a post to the Homotopy Type Theory Google Group, Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine wrote:

Let (x 0:X)(x_0:X) be any pointed type, and (𝒰,El)(\mathcal{U}, El) be a universe (with rules as I set out a couple of emails ago). Then X×𝒰X \times \mathcal{U} is again a universe, admitting all the same constructors as 𝒰\mathcal{U}: take
El(x,A)=El(A)El(x,A) = El(A),(x,A)+ 𝒰(y,B)=(x 0,A+ 𝒰B)(x,A) +_\mathcal{U} (y,B) = (x_0, A +_\mathcal{U} B),
and so on; that is, constructor operations on (X×𝒰)(X \times \mathcal{U}) are constantly x 0x_0 on the first component, and mirror those of 𝒰\mathcal{U} on the second component.
Now if 𝒰\mathcal{U} is univalent, and XX has non-trivial π 0\pi_0 (e.g. X=S 1X=S^1), then 𝒰→(X×𝒰\mathcal{U} \rightarrow (X \times \mathcal{U}) gives a univalent universe sitting inside a non-univalent one (again, with the rules as I set out earlier).
Slightly more generally, given any cumulative pair of universes 𝒰 0→𝒰 1\mathcal{U}_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{U}_1, we can consider 𝒰 0→A×𝒰 1\mathcal{U}_0 \rightarrow A \times \mathcal{U}_1; this shows we can additionally have the smaller universe represented by an element of the larger one.

Mike Shulmanadded:

[N]ot only is X×𝒰X \times \mathcal{U} not univalent, it’s not even “univalent on the image of 𝒰\mathcal{U}”, as was the case for the example in the groupoid model that I mentioned.

An axiom is a proposition in logic that a given theory requires to be true: every model of the theory is required to make the axiom hold true. The sense however is that an axiom is a basic true proposition, used to prove other true propositions (the theorems) in the theory.
Given a language LL (perhaps specified by a signature: a collection of types, function symbols and relation symbols), a theory is the collection of assertions which are derivable (using the rules of deduction of the ambient logic or deductive system) from a given set of assertions, called axioms of the theory. In other words, a theory is generated from a set of axioms, by starting with those axioms and applying rules of deduction, much as terms in an algebraic system may be generated from a set of basic terms by applying operations. Axioms should therefore be considered as presenting a theory; different axiom sets may well give the same theory.
In terms of a deductive system, axioms can be regarded as “rules with zero hypotheses”. The form of such axioms depends on the details of the deductive system used: it could be natural deduction, sequent calculus, a Hilbert system, etc. If we take sequent calculus, for instance, then any collection of sequents written in the given language LL
ϕ→⊢ x→ψ→
  \vec{\phi} \vdash_{\vec x} \vec{\psi}


(asserting that “If every proposition ϕ i\phi_i is true in context x→\vec{x} then also some ψ i\psi_i is/has to be true”) can be taken as a collection of axioms for some theory. Models of the theory will then be those structures of the language in which the axioms are interpreted as true statements. For example, a model of group theory is a structure in the language of groups for which the group theory axioms hold, which is (of course) a group.
Assuming the deductive system is sound?, every sequent which is the conclusion of a valid sequent deduction, starting from the axioms, will also be true in every model. And if the deductive system is also complete, then every sequent of the language which is true in every model will in fact be provable from the axioms.

Hilbert's sixth problem asks for an axiomatization of physics.

By intensional type theory one means (but see Rem. ) the flavor of type theory in which identity types are not forced to be mere propositions (that is: not necessarily (-1)-truncated).
The original definition of identity types in Martin-Löf dependent type theory [Martin-Löf (1975, §1.7 and p. 94)] is by default intensional: It takes an additional axiom or rule — the identity reflection rule, cf. Streicher (1993, p. 4, 13 ); Hofmann (1995, p. 16) — to turn intensional into extensional type theory (in which identity types are then truncated to mere propositions).
In particular, homotopy type theory is intensional: the categorical semantics of its identity types are path space objects.


Remark
(terminology)  Beware that some authors take the words “intensional type theory” to refer to type theories which fail to satisfy function extensionality. This is in general a requirement orthogonal to the (-1)-truncation of identity types.
Generally, the origin of the names “extensional” and “intensional” is somewhat confusing. Even where the term refers to the behaviour of equality, it in fact refers not to the typal equality expressed by identity types, but to judgmental equality:
The idea is that the identity type is always an “extensional” notion of equality (although it can be more or less extensional, depending on whether further extensionality principles like function extensionality and univalence hold). Thus, if the judgmental equality coincides with the identity type, then the former is also extensional, whence the type theory is called “extensional” — while if the two equalities do not coincide, then the judgmental equality has room to be more intensional than the identity type, making the type theory “intensional” (but see also Hofmann (1995, ftn. 3), p. 17).
(On this historical reading, “extensional type theory” should refer only to judgmentally extensional type theory with the reflection rule, which is much stronger than merely requiring all types to be h-sets.)


Decidability
Only the intensional but not the extensional Martin-Löf type theory has decidable type checking. (Martin-Löf 75, Hofmann 95).
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.

Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

The study of groups.
Representation theory is concerned with the study of algebraic structures via their representations. This concerns notably groups, directly or in their incarnation as group algebras, Hopf algebras or Lie algebras, and usually concerns linear representations, hence modules of these structures. But more generally representation theory also studies representations/modules/actions of generalizations of such structures, such as coalgebras via their comodules etc.
See also at geometric representation theory.
While classical mechanics considers deterministic evolution of particles and fields, quantum physics follows nondeterministic evolution where the probability of various outcomes of measurement may be predicted from the state in a Hilbert space representing the possible reality: that state undergoes a unitary evolution, what means that the generator of the evolution is −1\sqrt{-1} times a Hermitean operator called the quantum Hamiltonian or the Hamiltonian operator of the system. The theoretical framework for describing this precisely is the quantum mechanics. It involves a constant of nature, Planck constant hh; some quantum systems with spatial interpretation in the limit h→0h\to 0 lead to classical mechanical systems (not all: some phenomena including non-integer spin are purely quantum mechanical, but the properties depending on their existence survive in the “classical” limit); in limited generality, one can motivate and find the nonfunctorial procedure to single out a right inverse to taking this classical limit under the name quantization.
While quantum mechanics may be formulated for a wide range of physical systems, interpreted as particles, extended particles and fields, the quantum mechanics of fields is often called the quantum field theory and the quantum mechanics of systems of a fixed finite number of particles is often viewed as the quantum mechanics in a narrow sense.
nPOV
Mathematically, despite the basic formalism of quantum mechanics which is sound and clear, there are two big areas which are yet not clear. One is to understand quantization, in all cases – of particles, fields, strings and so on. The second and possibly more central to nLab is a problem how to define rigorously a wide range of quantum field theories and some related quantum mechanical systems like the hypothetical superstring theory. Regarding that this is a central goal, we also put emphasis on the interpretation of quantum mechanics via the picture which is a special case of a FQFT, and where the time evolution functorially leads to evolution operators.
We discuss some basic notions of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanical systems
Recall the notion of a classical mechanical system: the formal dual of a real commutative Poisson algebra.

Definition
A quantum mechanical system is a star algebra (A,(−) *)(A, (-)^\ast) over the complex numbers. The category of of quantum mechanical systems is the opposite category of *\ast-algebras:
QuantMechSys:=*Alg ℂ op.
  QuantMechSys := {\ast}Alg_{\mathbb{C}}^{op}
  \,.



Remark
It makes sense to think of this as a deformed version of a real Poisson algebra as follows:


the Poisson-Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra corresponds to the commutator of the *\ast-algebra:
[a,b]:=ab−ba,
  [a,b] := a b - b a
  \,,



the commutative algebra structure of the Poisson algebra coresponds to the Jordan algebra structure of the *\ast-algebra, with commutative (but non-associative!) product
(a,b):=ab+ba.
  (a,b) := a b + b a
  \,.



With this interpretation the derivation-property of the Poisson bracket over the other product is preserved: for all a,b,c∈Aa,b,c \in A we have
[a,(b,c)]=([a,b],c)+(b,[a,c]).
  [a,(b,c)] = ([a,b],c) + (b,[a,c])
  \,.


We thus may regard a non-commutative star-algebra as a non-associative Poisson algebra : a Jordan-Lie algebra. See there for more details.

Observables and states

Definition
Given a quantum mechanical system in terms of a star algebra AA, we say


an observable is an element a∈Aa \in A such that a *=aa^\ast = a;


a state is a linear function ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} which is positive in the sense that for all a∈Aa \in A we have ρ(aa *)≥0∈ℝ↪ℂ\rho(a a^\ast) \geq 0 \in \mathbb{R} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}.




Remark
One can formalize the idea that a quantum mechanical system is like a deformed classical mechanical system as follows:
To every  *{}^\ast-algebra AA is associated its poset of commutative subalgebras Com(A)Com(A). Then the corresponding quantum mechanical system is a classical mechanical system internal to the sheaf topos Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)):


The *\ast-algebra canonically induces a commuative algebra A̲∈Sh(Com(A))\underline A \in Sh(Com(A));


the (classical) states of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) are in natural bijection with the quantum states externally on AA;


the (classical) observables of A̲\underline{A} in Sh(Com(A))Sh(Com(A)) correspond to the external quantum observables on AA.


(…details…)

One also says that the internal classical mechanical system (Sh(Com(A)),A̲)(Sh(Com(A)), \underline{A}) is the “Bohrification” of the external quantum system AA. See there for more details.
Spaces of states
Given a *\ast-algebra AA together with a state ρ\rho on it, the GNS construction provides an inner product space H ρH_\rho together with an action of AA on H ρH_\rho and a vector Ω=(ρ)\Omega = \sqrt(\rho) – the vacuum vector? – such that for all a∈Aa \in A the value of the state ρ:A→ℂ\rho : A \to \mathbb{C} is obtained by applying aa to ρ\sqrt{\rho} and then taking the inner product with ρ\sqrt \rho:
ρ(A)=⟨ρ,aρ⟩.
  \rho(A) = \langle \sqrt\rho, a \sqrt \rho\rangle
  \,.


If the star algebra AA happens to be a C-star algebra, then this inner product space is naturally a Hilbert space.
Historically and still often in the literature, such a Hilbert space is taken as a fundamental input of the definition of quantum systems.
Traditionally, Dirac‘s “bra-ket” notation is used to represent vectors in such Hilbert spaces of states, where |ψ⟩|\psi\rangle represents a state and ⟨ψ|\langle\psi| represents its linear adjoint. State evolutions are expressed as unitary maps. Self-adjoint operators represent physical quantities such as position and momentum and are called observables. Measurements are expressed as sets of projectors onto the eigenvectors of an observable.
In mixed state quantum mechanics, physical states are represented as density operators ρ\rho, state evolution as maps of the form ρ↦U †ρU\rho \mapsto U^\dagger \rho U for unitary maps UU, and measurements are positive operator-valued measures (POVM’s). There is a natural embedding of pure states into the space of density matrices: |ψ⟩↦|ψ⟩⟨ψ||\psi\rangle \mapsto |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|. So, one way to think of mixed states is a probabilistic mixture of pure states.
ρ=∑ ia i|ψ i⟩⟨ψ i| \rho = \sum_i a_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i| 
Composite systems are formed by taking the tensor product of Hilbert spaces. If a pure state |Ψ⟩∈H 1⊗H 2|\Psi\rangle \in H_1 \otimes H_2 can be written as |ψ 1⟩⊗|ψ 2⟩|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle for |ψ i⟩∈H i|\psi_i\rangle \in H_i it is said to be separable. If no such |ψ i⟩|\psi_i\rangle exist, |Ψ⟩|\Psi\rangle is said to be entangled. If a mixed state is separable if it is the sum of separable pure states. Otherwise, it is entangled.
Flows and time evolution
As for classical mechanics, 1-parameter families of flows in a quantum mechanical system are induced from observables a∈Aa \in A by
ddλb λ=1iℏ[b λ,a].
  \frac{d}{d \lambda} b_\lambda = \frac{1}{i \hbar}[b_\lambda, a]
  \,.


In a non-relativistic system one specifies an observable HH – called the Hamiltonian – whose flow represents the time evolution of the system. (This is the Heisenberg picture.)
We comment on how to interpret this from the point of view of FQFT:
Quantum mechanics of point particles may be understood as a special case of the formalism of quantum field theory. It is interpreted as the quantum analog of the classical mechanics of point particles. Of course, we can take a configuration space of a system of particles looking like the configuration space of a single particle in a higher dimensional manifold.
Remark: related query on the relation between QFT and quantum mechanics (of particles and in general) can be found here.
One may usefully think of the quantum mechanics of a point particle propagating on a manifold XX as being (0+1)(0+1)-dimensional quantum field theory:
the fields of this system are maps Σ→X\Sigma \to X where Σ∈RiemBord 1\Sigma \in Riem Bord_1 are 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold cobordisms. These are the trajectories of the particle.
After quantization this yields a 1-dimensional FQFT given by a functor
U(−):RiemBord 1→Hilb
  U(-) : Riem Bord_1 \to Hilb


from cobordisms to Hilbert spaces (or some other flavor of vector spaces) that assigns


to the point the space of states ℋ\mathcal{H}, typically the space of L 2L_2-sections (with respect to a Riemannian metric on XX) of the background gauge field on XX under which the particle in question is charged


to the cobordism of Riemannian length tt the operator
U(t):=exp(tiℏH):ℋ→ℋ,
  U(t) := \exp\left(\frac{t}{i \hbar } H \right)
  : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{H}
  \,,


where HH is the Hamiltonian operator, typically of the form H=∇ †∘∇H = \nabla^\dagger \circ \nabla  for ∇\nabla the covariant derivative of the given background gauge field.


Such a setup describes the quantum mechanics of a particle that feels forces of backgound gravity encoded in the Riemannian metric on XX and forces of background gauge fields (such as the electromagnetic field) encoded in the covariant derivative ∇\nabla.
(This is the Schrödinger picture.)
Quantum subsystems

Definition
For 𝒜\mathcal{A} an algebra describing a quantum system, def. , a subsystem is a subalgebra (a subobject) B↪𝒜B \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}.
Two subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A} are called independent subsystems if the linear map
B 1⊗B 2→𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \to \mathcal{A}

(b 1,b 2)↦b 1⋅b 2  
  (b_1, b_2) \mapsto b_1 \cdot b_2


from the tensor product of algebras (the composite system) factors as an isomorphism
B 1⊗B 2→≃B 1∨B 2↪𝒜
  B_1 \otimes B_2 \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} B_1 \vee B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}


through the algebra B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that is generated by B 1B_1 and B 2B_2 inside 𝒜\mathcal{A} (the smallest subalgebra containing both).

See for instance (BrunettiFredenhagen, section 5.2.2).

Definition
Given two independent subsystems B 1,B 2↪𝒜B_1, B_2 \hookrightarrow \mathcal{A}, and two states ρ 1:B 1→ℂ\rho_1 : B_1 \to \mathbb{C} and ρ 2:B 2→ℂ\rho_2 : B_2 \to \mathbb{C}, then the corresponding product state ρ 1⊗ρ 2\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2 on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 is defined to be
(ρ 1⊗ρ 2):(b 1,b 2)↦ρ 1(b 1)ρ 2(b 2).
  (\rho_1 \otimes \rho_2) : 
  (b_1 , b_2) \mapsto \rho_1(b_1) \rho_2(b_2)
  \,.



Definition
There exist states on B 1∨B 2B_1 \vee B_2 that are not (convex combinations of) product states. This phenomenon is called entanglement.

Quantum field theory is the general framework for the description of the fundamental processes in physics as understood today. These are carried by configurations of fields under the generalized rules of quantum mechanics, therefore the name. Notably the standard model of particle physics is a quantum field theory and has been the main motivation for the development of the concept in general.
Historically quantum field theory grew out of attempts to combine classical field theory in the context of special relativity with quantum mechanics. While some aspects of it are understood in exceeding detail, the overall picture of what quantum field theory actually is used to be quite mysterious. There are two main approaches for axiomatizing and formalizing the notion:


algebraic quantum field theory: AQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of operator algebras “of observables” to patches of spacetime;


functorial quantum field theory: FQFT – this encodes a quantum field theory as an assignment of spaces of quantum states to patches of codimension 1, and of maps between spaces of states – the time evolution operator – to cobordisms between such patches.


Both these approaches try to capture the notion of a full quantum field theory. On the other hand, much activity in physics is concerned with perturbative quantum field theory. This is a priori to be thought of as an approximation to a full quantum field theory akin to the approximation of a function by its Taylor series, but not the least because it is often the only available technique, the tools of perturbative quantum field theory are to some extent also taken as a definition of quantum field theory.
The gap for instance between the formal study of the AQFT axioms and physics as done in practice by physicists had to a large extent been due to the fact that AQFT had little to say about perturbative quantum field theory. But recently this has been changing. See perturbative quantum field theory for more.
Recent times have seen major progress in understanding these axiomatizations and connecting them to the structures studied in physics (see the references below), but still the number of interesting phenomena in quantum field theory that physicists handle semi-rigorously and that are waiting for a fully formal understanding is large.
Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.

It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.


Whitehead's principle.


sets cover, and more generally n-types cover.


Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Semantics is the interpretation of the syntax of a theory in a model.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.
The category theoretic notions of

category and object

on the one hand and of

theory and model

on the other have been suggested (Lawvere) to usefully formalize, respectively, the heuristic notions

“general” and “particular”

as well as

“abstract” and “concrete”, respectively.

We have:


a (syntactic category of a) Lawvere theory TT (or the equivalent in any doctrine) TT is an abstract general or abstract universal (abstraktes Allgemeines)


the category TMod(E)T Mod(E) of TT-models/algebras in any context EE is a concrete general or concrete universal


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a particular.


That seems to be roughly what is suggested in Lawvere. Of course one could play with this further and consider further refinement such as


a (generating) object in TT is an abstract particular ;


an object of any TMod(E)T Mod(E) is a concrete particular.

In the (∞,1)-topos Top the construction of a loop space of a given topological space is familiar.
This construction may be generalized to any other (∞,1)-topos and in fact to any other (∞,1)-category with homotopy pullbacks.
Loop space objects are defined in any (∞,1)-category C\mathbf{C} with homotopy pullbacks: for XX any pointed object of C\mathbf{C} with point *→X{*} \to X, its loop space object is the homotopy pullback ΩX\Omega X of this point along itself:
ΩX → * ↓  ↓ * → X.
  \array{
    \Omega X &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& X
  }
  \,.


A (generalised) element of ΩX\Omega X may be thought of as a loop in XX at the base point **.
When the point x:*→Xx : {*} \to X is not clear from context, we can write Ω xX\Omega_x X or Ω(X,x)\Omega(X,x) to indicate the point.
Remarks
Since C(X,−)\mathbf{C}(X,-) commutes with homotopy limits, one has a natural homotopy equivalence Ω y¯C(X,Y)≃C(X,Ω yY)\Omega_{\bar{y}}\mathbf{C}(X,Y)\simeq \mathbf{C}(X,\Omega_y Y), for any objects XX and pointed object (Y,y)(Y,y) in C\mathbf{C}, where y¯\bar{y} denotes the morphism X→*→YX \to * \to Y.

stable (∞,1)-category


A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd
  \,,


the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}
  \hookrightarrow
  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.
Externally
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be an (∞,1)-category. Let X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} be an object.
As a discrete ∞-group the automorphism ∞\infty-group of XX is the sub-∞-groupoid
Aut(X)↪𝒞(X,X)
  Aut(X) \hookrightarrow \mathcal{C}(X,X)


of the derived hom space of morphisms in 𝒞\mathcal{C} from XX to itself, on those that are equivalences.
This is an ∞-group in ∞Grpd,
Aut(X)∈Grp(∞Grpd).
 Aut(X)\in Grp(\infty Grpd)
  \,.


Internally
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a cartesian closed (∞,1)-category (for instance an (∞,1)-topos). Write
[−,−]:𝒞 op×𝒞→𝒞
  [-,-] : \mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}


for the internal hom. Then for X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object, the internal automorphism ∞\infty-group is the subobject
Aut(X)↪[X,X]
  \mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow [X,X]


of the internal hom on those morphism that are equivalences.
In the special case that 𝒞\mathcal{C} is an ∞-topos, the delooping BAut(X)\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(X) of the internal automorphism ∞\infty-group is equivalently the ∞-image
*→BAut(X)↪Obj
  * \to \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(X) \hookrightarrow Obj


of the morphism
*→⊢XObj
  * \stackrel{\vdash X}{\to} Obj


to the object classifier, that modulates XX (the “name” of XX).
In homotopy type theory
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be an (∞,1)-topos. Then its internal language is homotopy type theory. In terms of this the object X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} is a type (homotopy type). In the type theory syntax the internal automorphism ∞\infty-group Aut(X)\mathbf{Aut}(X) then is (as a type, without yet the group structure)
⊢(X→≃X):Type,
  \vdash (X \stackrel{\simeq}{\to} X) : Type
  \,,


the subtype of the function type on the equivalences. Its delooping BAut(X)\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Aut}(X) is
⊢(∑ Y:Type[Y=X]):Type,
  \vdash \; \left(\sum_{Y : Type} [Y = X]\right) \colon Type
  \,,


where on the right we have the dependent sum over one argument of the bracket type/(-1)-truncation [X=Y]=isInhab(X=Y)[X = Y] = isInhab(X = Y) of the identity type (X=Y)(X = Y).
The equivalence of this definition to the previous one is essentially equivalent to the univalence axiom.
For XX any kind of space (or possibly a directed space, viewed as some sort of category or higher dimensional analogue of one), its loop space objects Ω xX\Omega_x X canonically inherit a monoidal structure, coming from concatenation of loops.
If x∈Xx \in X is essentially unique, then Ω xX\Omega_x X equipped with this monoidal structure remembers all of the structure of XX: we say X≃BΩ xXX \simeq B \Omega_x X call BAB A the delooping of the monoidal object AA.
What all these terms (“loops” Ω\Omega, “delooping” BB etc.) mean in detail and how they are presented concretely depends on the given setup. We discuss some of these below in the section Examples.

  \,.




Proposition
The (2,1)-category Grp ≥1Grp_{\geq 1} of connected groupoids is equivalent to its full sub-(2,1)-category on those objects of the form BG\mathbf{B}G, for GG a group.


Proof
Given a connected groupoid XX, pick any basepoint x∈Xx\in X and consider the canonical inclusion Bπ 1(X,x)⟶X\mathbf{B}\pi_1(X,x) \longrightarrow X. By construction this is fully faithful and by assumption of connectedness it is essentially surjective, hence it is an equivalence of groupoids.


Proposition
The hom-groupoids between connected groupoids with fundamental groups GG and HH, respectively, are equivalent to the action groupoids of the set of group homomorphisms G→HG \to H acted on by conjugation with elements of HH:
Grpd(BG,BH)≃Grp(G,H)// adH
  Grpd(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}H)
  \simeq
   Grp(G,H)//_{ad}H


Given two group homomorphisms ϕ 1,ϕ 2:G⟶H\phi_1, \phi_2 \colon G \longrightarrow H then an isomorphism between them in this hom-groupoid is an element h∈Hh \in H such that
ϕ 2=Ad h∘ϕ 1≔h −1⋅ϕ 1(−)⋅h.
  \phi_2 = Ad_h \circ \phi_1 \coloneqq h^{-1}\cdot \phi_1(-) \cdot h
  \,.



Proof
By direct inspection of the naturality square for the natural transformations which are the morphisms in Grpd(BG,BH)Grpd(\mathbf{B}G, \mathbf{B}H):
*    * ⟶h * ↓ g 1    ↓ ϕ 1(g 1)  ↓ ϕ 2(g 1) *    * ⟶h * ↓ g 2    ↓ ϕ 1(g 2)  ↓ ϕ 2(g 2) *    * ⟶h *.

    \\
    \ast && && \ast &\stackrel{h}{\longrightarrow}& \ast
  }
  \,.



Remark
The operation of forming π 1\pi_1 is equivalently the operation of forming the homotopy fiber product of the point inclusion with itself, and hence extends to a (2,1)-functor
π 1:Grpd */⟶Grp.
  \pi_1 \colon Grpd^{\ast/} \longrightarrow Grp
  \,.



Proposition
Restricted to connected groupoids among the pointed groupoids, the functor π 1:Grpd ≥1 */⟶Grp\pi_1 \colon Grpd^{\ast/}_{\geq 1} \longrightarrow Grp of remark  is an equivalence of (2,1)-categories.


Proof
It is clear that the functor is essentially surjective: for GG any group then π 1(BG,*)≃G\pi_1(\mathbf{B}G,\ast) \simeq G.
The more interesting point to notice is that π 1\pi_1 is indeed a fully faithful (2,1)-functor, in that for any (X,x),(Y,y)∈Grpd ≥1 */(X,x), (Y,y) \in Grpd^{\ast/}_{\geq 1} then the functor
(π 1) X,Y:Grpd */((X,y),(Y,y))⟶Grp(π 1(X,x),π 1(Y,y))
  (\pi_1)_{X,Y}
  \colon
  Grpd^{\ast/}((X,y),(Y,y))
  \longrightarrow
  Grp(\pi_1(X,x), \pi_1(Y,y))


is an equivalence of hom-groupoids. By prop.  it is sufficient to check this for X=BGX = \mathbf{B}G and Y=BHY = \mathbf{B}H with their canonical basepoints, hence to check that for any two groups G,HG,H the functor
(π 1) X,Y:Grpd */((BG,*),(BH,*))⟶Grp(G,H)
  (\pi_1)_{X,Y}
  \;\colon\;
  Grpd^{\ast/}((\mathbf{B}G,\ast),(\mathbf{B}H,\ast))
  \longrightarrow
  Grp(G,H)


is an equivalence.
To see this, observe that, by definition of pointed objects via the undercategory under the point, a morphism in Grpd */Grpd^{\ast/} between groupoids of this form B(−)\mathbf{B}(-) is a diagram in GrpGrp (unpointed) of the form
  *  ↙ ⇙ h ↘ BG  ⟶Bϕ  BH
  \array{
    && \ast
    \\
    & \swarrow &\swArrow_{h}& \searrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}G
    &&
    \underset{\mathbf{B}\phi}{\longrightarrow}
    &&
    \mathbf{B}H
  }


where the natural isomorphism is equivalently just the choice of an element h∈Hh \in H. Hence these morphisms are pairs (ϕ,h)(\phi,h) of a group homomorphism and an element of the domain.
We claim that the (2,1)-functor π 1\pi_1 takes such (ϕ,h)(\phi,h) to the homomorphism Ad h −1∘ϕ:G⟶HAd_{h^{-1}} \circ \phi \;\colon\; G \longrightarrow H. To see this, consider via remark  this functor as forming loops:
π 1(BG,*)={  *  ↙  ↘ *  ⇙ g  *  ↘  ↙   BG} g∈G.
  \pi_1(\mathbf{B}G,\ast)
  =
  \left\{

      && \ast
      \\
      & \swarrow && \searrow
      \\
      \ast && \swArrow_{\mathrlap{g}} && \ast
      \\
      & \searrow && \swarrow
      \\
      && \mathbf{B}G
    }

Unwinding the whiskering of natural transformations here, the claim follows, as indicated by the label of the upper 2-morphisms on the right.
One observes now that these extra labels hh are precisely the information that “trivializes” the conjugation action which in prop.  prevents the bare set of group homomorphism: a 2-morphism (ϕ 1,h 1)⇒(ϕ 2,h 2)(\phi_1, h_1) \Rightarrow (\phi_2,h_2) in Grp */Grp^{\ast/} is a natural isomorphism of groupoids

But this says in components that h 2=h 1⋅hh_2 = h_1\cdot h. Hence there is a at most one morphism in Grpd */((BG,*),(BH,*))Grpd^{\ast/}((\mathbf{B}G,\ast),(\mathbf{B}H,\ast)) from (ϕ 1,h 1)(\phi_1,h_1) to (ϕ 2,h 2)(\phi_2,h_2): it exists if ϕ 2=Ad h∘ϕ 1\phi_2 = Ad_h \circ \phi_1 and h 2=h 1⋅hh_2 = h_1\cdot h.
But since, by the previous argument, the functor π 1\pi_1 takes (ϕ 1,h 1)(\phi_1,h_1) to Ad h 1 −1∘ϕ 1Ad_{h_1^{-1}} \circ \phi_1, this means that such a morphism exists precisely if both (ϕ 1,h 1)(\phi_1,h_1) and (ϕ 2,h 2)(\phi_2,h_2) are taken to the same group homomorphism by π 1\pi_1
Ad h 2 −1∘ϕ 2=Ad h −1⋅h 1 −1∘ϕ 2=Ad h 1 −1∘ϕ 1.
  Ad_{h_2^{-1}} \circ \phi_2
  =
  Ad_{h^{-1}\cdot h_1^{-1}}\circ \phi_2
  = 
  Ad_{h_1^{-1}} \circ \phi_1

This establishes that π 1\pi_1 is alspo an equivalence on all hom-groupoids.

This proof also shows that B(−)\mathbf{B}(-) is in fact the inverse equivalence:

For parameterized ∞\infty-groupoids (∞\infty-stacks / (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves)
The following result makes precise for parameterized ∞-groupoids – for ∞-stacks – the general statement that kk-fold delooping provides a correspondence between n-categories that have trivial r-morphisms for r<kr \lt k and k-tuply monoidal n-categories.

Definition
An Ek-algebra object AA in an (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} is called groupal if its connected components π 0(A)∈H ≤0\pi_0(A) \in \mathbf{H}_{\leq 0} is a group object.
Write Mon 𝔼[k] gp(H)Mon^{gp}_{\mathbb{E}[k]}(\mathbf{H}) for the (∞,1)-category of groupal E kE_k-algebra objects in H\mathbf{H}.
A groupal E 1E_1-algebra – hence an groupal A-∞ algebra object in H\mathbf{H} – we call an ∞-group in H\mathbf{H}. Write ∞Grp(H)\infty Grp(\mathbf{H}) for the (∞,1)-category of ∞-groups in H\mathbf{H}.


Theorem
Let k>0k \gt 0, let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves and let H * ≥k\mathbf{H}_*^{\geq k} denote the full subcategory of the category H *\mathbf{H}_{*} of pointed objects, spanned by those pointed objects thar are k−1k-1-connected (i.e. their first kk homotopy sheaves) vanish. Then there is a canonical equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
H ≥k */≃Mon 𝔼[k] gp(H).
  \mathbf{H}^{\ast/}_{\geq k} \simeq Mon^{gp}_{\mathbb{E}[k]}(\mathbf{H}) \,.


between the pointed (k−1)(k-1)-connected objects and the groupal Ek-algebra objects in H\mathbf{H}.

This is Higher Algebra, theorem 5.2.6.10
Specifically for H=\mathbf{H} =  Top, this reduces to the following classical theorem due to Peter May, known as the May recognition theorem.

Theorem
Let YY be a topological space equipped with an action of the little cubes operad 𝒞 k\mathcal{C}_k and suppose that YY is grouplike. Then YY is homotopy equivalent to a kk-fold loop space Ω kX\Omega^k X for some pointed topological space XX.

This is Higher Algebra, theorem 5.2.6.15

Remark
For k=1k = 1 we have a looping/delooping equivalence

  Grp(\mathbf{H})

  \mathbf{H}_{\geq 1}^{\ast /}


between pointed connected objects in H\mathbf{H} and grouplike A-∞ algebra objects in H\mathbf{H}: ∞-group objects in H\mathbf{H}.


Remark
If the ambient (∞,1)-topos has homotopy dimension 0 then every connected object EE admits a point *→E* \to E. Still, the (∞,1)-category of pointed connected objects differs from that of unpointed connected objects (because in the latter the natural transformations may have nontrivial components on the point, while in the former case they may not).
The connected objects EE which fail to be ∞-groups by failing to admit a point are of interest: these are the ∞-gerbes in the (∞,1)-topos.

For cohesive ∞\infty-groupoids
A special case of the parameterized ∞\infty-groupoids above are cohesive ∞-groupoids. Looping and delooping for these is discussed at cohesive (∞,1)-topos – structures in the section Cohesive ∞-groups.
For (∞,n)(\infty,n)-categories
See delooping hypothesis.
A smooth ∞\infty-groupoid is an ∞-groupoid equipped with cohesion in the form of smooth structure. Examples include smooth manifolds, Lie groups, Lie groupoids and generally Lie infinity-groupoids, but also for instance moduli spaces of differential forms, moduli stacks of principal connections and generally of cocycles in differential cohomology.
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd of all smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. It realizes a higher geometry version of differential geometry.
Many properties of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids are inherited from the underlying Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids. See ETop∞Grpd for more.
There is a refinement of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids to synthetic differential ∞-groupoids. See SynthDiff∞Grpd for more on that.

Definition
For XX a smooth manifold, say an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} is a differentiably good open cover if each non-empty finite intersection of the U iU_i is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
Every paracompact smooth manifold admits a differentiably good open cover.


Proof
This is mathematical folklore. A detailed proof is given at good open cover.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.



Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage. The Grothendieck topology that is generated from it is the standard open cover topology.



Proof
For {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} any open cover of a paracompact manifold also ∐ iU i\coprod_i U_i is paracompact. Hence we may find a differentiably good open cover {K j→∐ iU i}\{K_j \to \coprod_i U_i\}. This is then a refinement of the original open cover of XX.


Definition
Let CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} be the site of Cartesian spaces with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage of differentiably good open covers.


Definition
The (∞,1)-topos of smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on CartSp smooth{}_{smooth}:
Smooth∞Grpd≔Sh (∞,1)(CartSp smooth).
  Smooth \infty Grpd 
   \coloneqq
  Sh_{(\infty,1)}(CartSp_{smooth})
  \,.




Remark
(Brown-Gersten property)  The homotopy descent of simplicial presheaves on the above site may conveniently be checked by a Brown-Gersten property, see there.


Cohesion

Proposition
Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is a cohesive (∞,1)-topos.


Proof
The site CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (as discussed there) an ∞-cohesive site. See there for the implication.


Definition
Let SmoothMfd be the large site of paracompact smooth manifolds with smooth functions between them and equipped with the coverage whose covering families are differentiably good open covers : open covers {U i→U}\{U_i \to U\} where each non-empty open intersection is diffeomorphic to a Cartesian space.


Proposition
This does indeed define a coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated by it is the standard open cover topology.


Proof
This is discussed in detail at good open cover.


Proposition
The (∞,1)-topos Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd is equivalent to the hypercompletion Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd)\hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd) of the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the large site SmoothMfd
Smooth∞Grpd≃Sh^ (∞,1)(SmoothMfd).
  Smooth \infty Grpd \simeq \hat Sh_{(\infty,1)}(SmoothMfd)
  \,.



Proof
By the above we have that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is a dense sub-site of SmoothMfd. With this the claim follows as in the analogous discussion at ETop∞Grpd.


Corollary
The canonical embedding of smooth manifolds as 0-truncated objects in Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd is a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor
SmoothMfd↪Smooth∞Grpd,.
  SmoothMfd \hookrightarrow Smooth \infty Grpd
  ,.


Relative cohesion
We discuss the relation of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth\infty Grpd to other cohesive (∞,1)-toposes.
Continuous cohesion
The cohesive (∞,1)-topos ETop∞Grpd of Euclidean-topological ∞-groupoids has as site of definition CartSp top{}_{top}. There is a canonical forgetful functor
i:CartSp smooth→CartSp top
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \to CartSp_{top}



Proposition
The functor ii extends to an essential (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(i !⊣i *⊣i *):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_*)
  : 
  Smooth\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd


such that the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding is factored through the induced inclusion SmoothMfd ↪i\stackrel{i}{\hookrightarrow} Mfd as
SmoothMfd ↪ Smooth∞Grpd ↓ i  ↓ i ! Mfd ↪ ETop∞Grpd
  \array{
    SmoothMfd &\hookrightarrow& Smooth\infty Grpd
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i}} && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{i_!}}
    \\
    Mfd &\hookrightarrow& ETop\infty Grpd
  }
  \,



Proof
Using the observation that ii preserves coverings and pullbacks along morphism in covering families, the proof follows precisely the steps of the proof of this proposition.
(Both of these are special cases of a general statement about morphisms of (∞,1)-sites, which should eventually be stated in full generality somewhere).


Corollary
The essential global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd factors through that of ETop∞Grpd
(Π Smooth⊣Disc Smooth⊣Γ Smooth):Smooth∞Grpd→i *←i *→i !ETop∞Grpd→Γ ETop←Disc ETop→Π ETop∞Grpd
  (\Pi_{Smooth} \dashv Disc_{Smooth} \dashv \Gamma_{Smooth})
   : 
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{i_!}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{i^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{i_*}{\to}}}
  ETop\infty Grpd
   \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{ETop}}{\to}}{\stackrel{\overset{Disc_{ETop}}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{ETop}}{\to}}}
  \infty Grpd 



Proof
This follows from the essential uniqueness of the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism and of adjoint (∞,1)-functors.


Observation
The functor i !i_! here is the forgetful functor that forgets smooth structure and only remembers Euclidean topology-structure.

Infinitesimal cohesion
Observe that CartSp smooth{}_{smooth} is (the syntactic category of) a Lawvere theory: the algebraic theory of smooth algebras (C ∞C^\infty-rings). Write SmoothAlg:=Alg(C)SmoothAlg := Alg(C) for the category of its algebras. Let InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opInfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the infinitesimally thickened points.

Definition
Let CartSp synthdiff↪SmoothAlg op{}_{synthdiff} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} be the full subcategory on the objects of the form U×DU \times D with D∈CartSp smooth↪SmoothAlg opD \in CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op} and D∈InfPoint↪SmoothAlg opD \in InfPoint \hookrightarrow SmoothAlg^{op}. Write
i:CartSp smooth↪CartSp synthdiff
  i : CartSp_{smooth} \hookrightarrow CartSp_{synthdiff}


for the canonical inclusion.


Proposition
The inclusion exhibits an infinitesimal cohesive neighbourhood of Smooth∞GrpdSmooth \infty Grpd
(i !⊣i *⊣i *⊣i !):Smooth∞Grpd↪SynthDiff∞Grpd,
  (i_! \dashv i^* \dashv i_* \dashv i^!)
  :
  Smooth \infty Grpd
   \hookrightarrow
  SynthDiff\infty Grpd
  \,,


where SynthDiff∞Grpd is the cohesive (∞,1)-topos of synthetic differential ∞-groupoids: the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff}.


Proof
This follows as a special case of this proposition after observing that CartSp synthdiffCartSp_{synthdiff} is an infinitesimal neighbourhood site of CartSp smoothCartSp_{smooth} in the sense defined there.

In SynthDiff∞Grpd we have ∞-Lie algebras and ∞-Lie algebroids as actual infinitesimal objects. See there for more details.
Truncations
The (1,1)-topos on the 0-truncated smooth ∞\infty-groupoids is
Sh(CartSp)≃Smooth∞Grpd ≤0↪Smooth∞Grpd,
  Sh(CartSp) 
  \simeq 
  Smooth \infty Grpd_{\leq 0} \hookrightarrow Smooth\infty Grpd

the sheaf topos on SmthMfd/CartSp discussed at smooth space.
The concrete objects in there
Smooth∞Grpd ≤0 conc↪Smooth∞Grpd
  Smooth\infty Grpd_{\leq 0}^{conc}

  Smooth \infty Grpd


are precisely the diffeological spaces.

Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
The notion of principal ∞\infty-bundle is a categorification of principal bundle from groups and groupoids to ∞-groupoids, or rather from parameterized groupoids (generalized spaces called stacks) to parameterized ∞\infty-groupoids (generalized spaces called ∞-stacks).

We define GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles in the general context of an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, with GG a group object in the (∞,1)-topos.
Recall that for A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} an object equipped with a point pt A:*→Apt_A : {*} \to A , its corresponding loop space object ΩA\Omega A is the homotopy pullback
ΩA → * ↓  ↓ * → A.

Conversely, for G∈HG \in \mathbf{H} we say an object BG\mathbf{B}G is a delooping of GG if it has an essentially unique point and if G≃ΩBGG \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}G. We call GG an ∞-group. More in detail, its structure as a group object in an (∞,1)-category is exhibited by the ?ech nerve?

We discuss now that PP canonically has the structure of a GG-principal ∞-bundle and that BG\mathbf{B}G is the fine moduli space for GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles.

Definition
(principal GG-action)
Let GG be a group object in the (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}. A principal action of GG on a morphism (P→X)∈H(P \to X) \in \mathbf{H} is a groupoid object P//GP//G that sits over *//G*//G in that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams Δ op→H\Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H}
⋮  ⋮ P×G×G →(p 2,p 3) G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓ P → *

    P \times G

in H\mathbf{H};
and such that P→XP \to X exhibits the (∞,1)-colimit
X≃lim →(P//G:Δ op→H)
  X \simeq \lim_\to (P//G : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H})


called the base space over which the action takes place.

We may think of P//GP//G as the action groupoid of the GG-action on PP. For us it defines this GG-action.

Proposition
The GG-principal action as defined above satisfies the principality condition in that we have an equivalence of groupoid objects
⋮  ⋮ P× XP× XP →≃ P×G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P× XP →≃ P×G ↓↓  ↓↓ P →≃ P.
   \array{
     \vdots && \vdots

     P \times_X P \times_X P
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
     P \times G \times G
     \\
    \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow 
     && \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow

     P \times_X P

     P \times G
     \\
     \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
     \\
     P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P
   }
   \,.
 


Proof
This principality condition asserts that the groupoid object P//GP//G is effective. By Giraud's axioms characterizing (∞,1)-toposes, every groupoid object in H\mathbf{H} is effective.


Proposition
For X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G any morphism, its homotopy fiber P→XP \to X is canonically equipped with a principal GG-action with base space XX.


Proof
First we show that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams
⋮  ⋮  ⋮ P× XP× XP →≃ P×G×G → G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P× XP →≃ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓  ↓↓ P →= P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ X →= X →g BG,
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    P \times_X P \times_X P 
    &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P \times G \times G
    &\to& G \times G
    \\
    \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
    && 
   \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow 
    && \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P \times_X P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P \times G

    \\
    \downarrow\downarrow
    && \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P &\stackrel{=}{\to}& P &\stackrel{}{\to}& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{=}{\to}& X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,,


with the right square swhere the left horizontal morphisms are equivalences, as indicated. We proceed by induction through the height of this diagram.
The defining (∞,1)-pullback square for P× XPP \times_X P is
P× XP → P ↓  ↓ P → X
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X
  }


To compute this, we may attach the defining (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback square of PP to obtain the pasting diagram
P× XP → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


and use the pasting law for pullbacks, to conclude that P× XPP \times_X P is the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


By definition of PP as the homotopy fiber of X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G, the lower horizontal morphism is equivbalent to P→*→BGP \to {*} \to \mathbf{B}G, so that P× XPP \times_X P is also equivalent to the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


This finally may be computed as the pasting of two pullbacks
P× XP ≃ P×G → G → *   ↓  ↓  ↓   P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\simeq& P \times G &\to& G &\to& {*}
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    &&P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


of which the one on the right is the defining one for GG and the remaining one on the left is just an (∞,1)-product.
Proceeding by induction from this case we find analogously that P × X n+1≃P×G × nP^{\times_X^{n+1}} \simeq P \times G^{\times_n}: suppose this has been shown for (n−1)(n-1), then the defining pullback square for P × X n+1P^{\times_X^{n+1}} is
P× XP × X n → P ↓  ↓ P × X n → X.
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X
  }
  \,.


We may again paste this to obtain
P× XP × X n → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P × X n → X → BG
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    &\to&
    *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
  }


and use from the previous induction step that
(P × X n→X→BG)≃(P × X n→*→BG)
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to X \to \mathbf{B}G) 
  \simeq
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to * \to \mathbf{B}G)


to conclude the induction step with the same arguments as before.
This shows that P//GP//G is the Cech nerve of P→XP \to X. It remains to show that indeed X=lim → nP×G × nX = {\lim_\to}_n P \times G^{\times^n}. For this notice that *→BG* \to \mathbf{B}G is an effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category. Hence so is P→XP \to X. This proves the claim, by definition of effective epimorphism.
using this we have
X ≃BG∏ BGX  ≃(lim → nG × n)∏ BGX  ≃lim → n(G × n∏ BGX)  ≃lim → n(P×G × n)  ≃lim →P//G.
  \begin{aligned}
    X & \simeq \mathbf{B}G \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
    \\
      & \simeq \left({\lim_{\to}}_n G^{\times^n}\right) \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_{\to}}_n ( G^{\times^n} \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to}_n ( P\times G^{\times^n} )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to} P//G
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


We have established that every cocycle X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G canonically induced a GG-principal action on the homotopy fiber P→XP \to X. The following definition declares the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles to be those GG-principal actions that do arise this way.

Definition
We say a GG-principal action of GG on PP over XX is a GG-principal ∞-bundle if the colimit over P//G→*//GP//G \to *//G produces a pullback square: the bottom square in
⋮  ⋮ P×G×G → G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓ P → * ↓  ↓ X=lim →(P×G •) →g BG=lim →(G •).

Definition
For GG an infinity-group in H\mathbf{H} and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} any object, write
GBund(X)⊂Grpd(H)/*//G
  G Bund(X) \subset Grpd(\mathbf{H})/{*//G}


for the sub-(infinity,1)-category on the over-(infinity,1)-category of the groupoid objects over *//G*//G on the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles as above.


Proposition
We have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
GBund(X)≃H(X,BG)
  G Bund(X) \simeq \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)


of GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles over XX with cocycles X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G.


Proof
The arrow category H I\mathbf{H}^I is still an (infinity,1)-topos and hence the Giraud-Lurie axioms still hold. This means that by the discussion at groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category (using the statement below HTT, cor. 6.2.3.5) we have an equivalence
Grpd(H I)≃(H I) eff I
  Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I) \simeq 
  (\mathbf{H}^{I})^{I}_{eff}


between groupoid objects in H I\mathbf{H}^I and effective epimorphisms in the arrow category.
Notice that groupoid objects and effective epis in H I\mathbf{H}^I are given objectwise over the two objects of the interval I=Δ[1]I = \Delta[1].
Restricting this equivalence along the inclusion
H(X,BG)↪(H I) I
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
    \hookrightarrow
  (\mathbf{H}^I)^I


given by sending a cocycle to its homotopy fiber diagram
(X→BG)↦(P → * ↓  ↓ X → BG)
 (X \to \mathbf{B}G)
  \mapsto 
  \left(
     \array{
        P &\to& * 
        \\
        \downarrow && \downarrow
        \\
        X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
     }
  \right)


therefore yields precisely the equivalence in question
GBund(X) ↪ Grpd(H I) ↓ ≃  ↓ ≃ H(X,BG) ↪hofib (H I) I.
  \array{
     G Bund(X) &\hookrightarrow& Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I)
     \\
     \downarrow^\simeq && \downarrow^\simeq
     \\
     \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{hofib}{\hookrightarrow}&
     (\mathbf{H}^I)^I
  }
  \,.


In words this says that the cohomology on XX with coefficients in GG classified GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles, and in fact does so on the level of cocycles.
Connections on GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles
For some comments on the generalization of the notion of connection on a bundle to principal ∞\infty-bundles see differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos – survey.
A homotopy fiber sequence is a “long left-exact sequence” in an (∞,1)-category. (The dual concept is that of cofiber sequence.)
Traditionally fiber sequences have been considered in the context of homotopical categories such as model categories and Brown category of fibrant objects which present the (∞,1)-category in question. In particular, classically this was considered for Top itself. In these cases they are obtained in terms of homotopy pullbacks. Since, as discussed there, the homotopy fiber of a morphism may be computed as the ordinary 1-categorical fiber of any fibration resolution of this morphism, one often also speaks of fibration sequences.

The notion of ∞\infty-action is the notion of action (module/representation) in homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory, from algebra to higher algebra.
Notably a monoid object in an (∞,1)-category AA may act on another object NN by a morphism A⊗N→NA \otimes N \to N which satisfies an action property up to coherent higher homotopy.
If the ∞\infty-action is suitably linear in some sense, this is also referred to as ∞-representation.
We discuss the actions of ∞-groups in an (∞,1)-topos, following NSS. (For groupoid ∞-actions see there.)
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos.
Let G∈Grp(H)G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) be an group object in an (∞,1)-category in H\mathbf{H}, hence a homotopy-simplicial object on H\mathbf{H} of the form
(⋯⟶⟶⟶⟶G×G⟶⟶⟶G⟶⟶*)
  \left(
  \cdots 
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
  G \times G \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}} G \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow} *
  \right)


satisfying the groupoidal Segal conditions.
hence an ∞-group.

Definition
An action (or ∞\infty-action, for emphasis) of GG on an object V∈HV \in \mathbf{H} is a groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category which is equivalent to one of the form
(⋯⟶⟶⟶⟶V×G×G⟶⟶⟶V×G⟶p 1⟶ρV)
  \left(
  \cdots 
  \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}}}
  V \times G \times G \stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\stackrel{\longrightarrow}{\longrightarrow}} V \times G \stackrel{\overset{\rho}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{p_1}{\longrightarrow}} V  
  \right)


such that the projection maps
⋯ ⟶⟶⟶⟶ V×G×G ⟶⟶⟶ V×G ⟶p 1⟶ρ V   ↓  ↓  ↓ ⋯ ⟶⟶⟶⟶ G×G ⟶⟶⟶ G ⟶⟶ *
  \array{

  }


constitute a morphism of groupoid objects V⫽G→*⫽GV\sslash G \to *\sslash G.
The (∞,1)-category of such actions is the slice of groupoid objects over *⫽G*\sslash G on these objects.

There is an equivalent formulation which does not invoke the notion of groupoid object in an (∞,1)-category explicitly. This is based on the fundamental fact, discussed at ∞-group, that delooping constitutes an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
B:Grp(H)→H ≥1 */.
  \mathbf{B} : Grp(\mathbf{H}) \to \mathbf{H}^{*/}_{\geq 1}
  \,.


form group objects in an (∞,1)-category to the (∞,1)-category of connected pointed objects in H\mathbf{H}.

Proposition
Every ∞\infty-action ρ:V×G→V\rho : V \times G \to V has a classifying morphism c ρ:V⫽G→BG\mathbf{c}_\rho : V \sslash G \to \mathbf{B}G in that there is a fiber sequence
V ↓ V⫽G →ρ¯ BG
  \array{
    V
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    V \sslash G &\stackrel{\overline{\rho}}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }


such that ρ\rho is the GG-action on VV regarded as the corresponding GG-principal ∞-bundle modulated by ρ¯\overline{\rho}.

This allows to characterize ∞\infty-actions in the following convenient way. See (NSS) for a detailed discussion.

Definition
For V∈HV \in \mathbf{H} an object, a GG-∞\infty-action ρ\rho on VV is a fiber sequence in H\mathbf{H} of the form
V → V⫽G   ↓ ρ¯   BG.
  \array{
    V &\to& V \sslash G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\overline{\rho}}}
    \\
    && \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.


The (∞,1)-category of GG-actions in H\mathbf{H} is the slice (∞,1)-topos of H\mathbf{H} over BG\mathbf{B}G:
Act H(G)≔H /BG.
  Act_{\mathbf{H}}(G) 
    \;\coloneqq\; 
  \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}
  \,.




Remark
At least in the special case that H=Grpd ∞\mathbf{H} \,=\, Grpd_\infty, this may also be understood as an instance of the “fundamental theorem of 


∞

\infty

-topos theory”, see there. For a model category-presentation see also Borel model structure – Relation to the slice over the simplicial classifying space.



Remark
A ρ∈Act H(G)\rho \in Act_{\mathbf{H}}(G) corresponds to a morphism denoted ρ¯:V⫽G→BG\overline{\rho} : V\sslash G \to \mathbf{B}G in H\mathbf{H} hence to an object ρ¯∈H /BG\overline{\rho} \in \mathbf{H}_{/\mathbf{B}G}.
A morphism ϕ:ρ 1→ρ 2\phi : \rho_1 \to \rho_2   in Act H(G)Act_{\mathbf{H}}(G) corresponds to a diagram
V 1⫽G  →  V 2⫽G   ρ 1¯↘  ↙ ρ 2¯   BG
  \array{
     V_1 \sslash G &&\stackrel{}{\to}&& V_2 \sslash G
     \\
     & {}_{\mathllap{\overline{\rho_1}}}\searrow && \swarrow_{\mathrlap{\overline{\rho_2}}}
     \\
     && \mathbf{B}G
  }


in H\mathbf{H}.


Remark
The bundle ρ¯\overline{\rho} in def.  is the universal ρ\rho-associated VV-fiber ∞-bundle.


Remark
In the form of def.  ∞\infty-actions have a simple formulation in the internal language of homotopy type theory: a GG-action on VV is simply a dependent type over BG\mathbf{B}G with fiber VV:
*:BG⊢V(*):Type.
  * : \mathbf{B}G \vdash V(*) : Type
 \,.


Model category presentation
In the context of geometrically discrete ∞-groupoids a model category structure presenting the (∞,1)-category of ∞\infty-actions is the Borel model structure (DDK 80).
In full generality, an ∞\infty-representation is an ∞-action of some higher algebraic structure on some object in a higher category up to coherent homotopy. One also speaks of representation up to homotopy or maybe sh-representations .
We motivate the general notion of ∞\infty-representation by recalling first some category theoretic aspects of the ordinary notion of representation, and then leading over to the analogous (∞,1)-category theoretic notions.
Representations as functors
Recall that for GG a discrete group with delooping groupoid BG=(G→→)\mathbf{B}G = (G \stackrel{\to}{\to}), and kkVect the category of vector spaces (over some base field kk), ordinary linear representations of GG are equivalently functors
ρ:BG→kVect.
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to k Vect
  \,.


Such a functor takes the single object of BG\mathbf{B}G to some vector space VV and takes every morphism (*→g*)(* \stackrel{g}{\to} * ) in BG\mathbf{B}G labeled by an element g∈Gg \in G to a linear automorphism ρ(g):V→V\rho(g) : V \to V such that composition and the identity is respected. We have an equivalence of categories
Func(BG,kVect)≃Rep k(G).
  Func(\mathbf{B}G, k Vect) \simeq Rep_k(G)
  \,.


Here the category VectVect could be replaced by other categories and they need not be abelian categories or otherwise linear for the above to make sense. For instance if we take instead the category Set itself, then a functor
ρ:BG→Set
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to Set


is what is called a permutation representation. In topology one is interested in representations in Top
ρ:BG→Top.
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to Top
  \,.


(However, rarely is it sufficient to regard these just as functors to the 1-category TopTop. Instead, in order to speak about topological fiber bundles and fibrations, one needs to regard Top here as an (∞,1)-category and regard ρ:BG→Top\rho : \mathbf{B}G \to Top as an (∞,1)-functor. This we come to below in ∞-Representations)
Moreover, we may replace BG\mathbf{B}G by a more general groupoid. For KK any groupoid, a functor
ρ:K→kVect
  \rho : K \to k Vect


is called a linear representation of KK. This now picks not just a single vector space V∈VectV \in Vect, but one vector space V xV_x for each object x∈Kx \in K. And to each morphism (x→gy)(x \stackrel{g}{\to} y) in KK is assigns a linear map ρ(g):V x→V y\rho(g) : V_x \to V_y.
For instance if K=Π 1(X)K = \Pi_1(X) is the fundamental groupoid of a manifold XX, then a representation
ρ:Π(X)→vect
  \rho : \Pi(X) \to vect


is a vector bundle over XX with flat connection on a bundle.
And we do not even need to assume that KK here is a groupoid. For instance if DD is a directed graph (or quiver) and F(D)F(D) its path category, then a functor
F(D)→Vect
  F(D) \to Vect


is called a quiver-representation of DD.
One could in principle therefore speak of a functor
F(D)→Set
  F(D) \to Set


as a “quiver permutation representation”, but there does not seem to be much use of this terminology in practice. The examples do show, however, that there is considerable overlap between the notion of representation and of functor .
Structured representations as morphisms in 2-toposes
Still a bit more generally, we can speak of representations that preserve extra structure, such as smooth structure. For instance for GG a Lie group we have that BG\mathbf{B}G is a Lie groupoid: an object in the (2,1)-topos of (2,1)-sheaves over the site C=C =  CartSp or C=C = Diff.
We may also promote the category Vect to this (2,1)(2,1)-topos, by replacing it by the stack VectBundVectBund, which assigns to each test manifold U∈CU \in C the groupoid of smooth vector bundles over UU. Then a morphism
ρ:BG→VectBund
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to VectBund


in the (2,1)-topos Sh (2,1)(C)Sh_{(2,1)}(C) is a smooth representation of GG, in that the linear automorphisms ρ(g):V→V\rho(g) : V \to V depend smoothly on the point g∈Gg \in G.
We can recover the underlying ordinary representation by applying the global section functor Γ:Sh (2,1)(C)→Grpd\Gamma : Sh_{(2,1)}(C) \to Grpd. This is given by evaluating every thing on the terminal object *∈C{*} \in C, which here is just the ordinary point, regarded as a smmoth manifold.
This yields the underlying bare representation
Γ(ρ):BG→Vect.
  \Gamma(\rho) : \mathbf{B}G \to Vect
  \,.


Conversely, one finds that extending such a bare representation from the point to all test spaces in CC amounts to equipping it with smooth structure.
As before, this is not restricted to connected objects: we may replace BG\mathbf{B}G here with any Lie groupoid. For instance for XX a smooth manifold and P 1(X)\mathbf{P}_1(X) is smooth path groupoid a representation
ρ:P 1(X)→VectBund
  \rho : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to VectBund


as a morphism in the 2-topos is a vector bundle on XX with connection on a bundle. Or if we consider non-linear representations, a representation
ρ:P 1(X)→BG
  \rho : \mathbf{P}_1(X) \to \mathbf{B}G


is a GG-principal bundle with connection on a bundle on XX. See parallel transport for more details and references.
By just changing the site here, we can implement other geometric structures. For instance for GG an algebraic group we may think of BG\mathbf{B}G as an algebraic stack over something like the fppf-site structure C=CAlg k opC = CAlg_k^{op} on formal duals of commutative kk-algebras or similar.
In this case there is a well-known good generalization of VectBundVectBund: instead of just vector bundles we can consider their completion to quasicoherent sheaves. The stack of these is the object in the (2,1)-topos given by
QC:SpecA↦AMod,  
  QC : Spec A \mapsto A Mod
  \,,


where on the right we have the groupoid of modules over AA. Over the point this is again just a kk-module hence a vector space and hence a representation
ρ:BG→QC
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to QC


of an algebraic group is a representation of GG on a vector space.
But also here we may allow the represented structure to have more than one object. For instance for XX any scheme regarded as an object in Sh (2,1)(C)Sh_{(2,1)}(C) a representation of XX in the context of QCQC is a morphism
ρ:X→QC,
  \rho : X \to QC
  \,,


which is equivalently a quasicoherent sheaf of modules on XX. As before, we may think of this as assigning to each point of XX one representation space, only that in a scheme XX there are no morphisms that would act on these.
But more generally for KK an algebraic stack, a representation
ρ:K→QC
  \rho : K \to QC


assigns to each point of K 0K_0 a representation space, such that these glue together to a quasicoherent sheaf of modules, and to each morphism in KK a morphism between the corresponding representation spaces, as before.
Analogous constructions are available for more general sites, effectively we can take CC to be the opposite category of TT-algebras over a Lawvere theory for TT any algebraic theory that contains the theory of abelian groups. If for instance we take T=T = CartSp we are back to the smooth case discussed before.
Also notice that if we take the site to be the point, C=*C = *, then sheaves over it are just sets and stacks over it are just bare groupoids, so that we recover the discussion at the very beginning.
∞\infty-Representations
We have found above the the term “representation” it to a large extent congruent with the term “morphism in a (2,1)-topos with codomain a stack of modules”.
This way of thinking of representations has an immediate generalization to higher category theory and in particular to (∞,1)-category theory/homotopy theory.
To start with the simple discussion over the point again, a model for a notion of a category of ∞\infty-modules that is useful is an (∞,1)-category Ch •(k)Ch_\bullet(k) that is presented by a model structure on chain complexes.
If again GG is a discrete group, then an (∞,1)-functor (equivalently: a “strong homotopy-functor” or “homotopy coherent functor”, see there for details)
ρ:BG→Ch •(k)
  \rho : \mathbf{B}G \to Ch_\bullet(k)


assigns


to the single obect of BG\mathbf{B}G a chain complex V •V_\bullet;


to a group element g∈Gg \in G a chain map ρ(g):V •→V •\rho(g) : V_\bullet \to V_\bullet;


to a pair of group elements g,g′g, g' a chain homotopy
ρ(g,g′):ρ(g′)∘ρ(g)⇒ρ(g′g)\rho(g,g') : \rho(g')\circ\rho(g) \Rightarrow \rho(g' g);


to a triple of group elements a homotopy of homotopies between composites of ρ(g,g′),ρ(g,g″)\rho(g,g'), \rho(g,g'') and ρ(g′,g″)\rho(g',g'') and so on
(see the diagrams at group cohomology for more details in low degree).


In other words, this is much like representation of GG as before on an ordinary vector space, only that now the action property of ρ\rho holds only up to coherent homotopy . Therefore people also speak of representations up to homotopy (AbadCrainic) as well as strong homotopy representations and many other variants.
As before, there is in principle no reason to restrict oneself to representations of groupoids here. For KK any ∞-groupoid or even (∞,1)-category (recall the quiver representations) and for ModMod any (∞,1)-category of ∞\infty-modules (for instance as presented by a model structure on modules over an algebra over an operad) we may call an (∞,1)-functor
ρ:K→Mod
  \rho : K \to Mod


an ∞\infty-representation of KK.
If we wish to consider ∞\infty-generalizations of permutation representations we can also consider more general codomain (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories here. For instance if we take ∞Grpd itself, then an ∞\infty-permutation representation
K→∞Grpd
  K \to \infty Grpd


is known as an (∞,1)-presheaf. For KK the delooping of an ordinary group or the orbit category of a topological group, such appear genuinely from the point of view of representations for instance in equivariant cohomology and equivariant homotopy theory. Notice that by the homotopy hypothesis-theorem we have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
∞Grpd≃Top
  \infty Grpd \simeq Top


so that the above is equivalently an (∞,1)-functor
K→Top
  K \to Top


hence literally a representation up to homotopy in the classical sense of homotopy theory.
As before, all this may be lifted from the point into large classes of (∞,1)-toposes to equip the notion of ∞\infty-representation with geometric structure (algebraic structure, smooth structure, etc.)
There are then analogs of the above relation between representations of path groupoids and connections on bundles. For more on this see higher parallel transport. Quite generally, in every locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} there is a notion of fundamental ∞-groupoid P(X)\mathbf{P}(X) of any object XX. Representation of Π(X)\mathbf{\Pi}(X) define general abstract flat differential cohomology and local systems on XX, generally also in nonabelian cohomology (see there for some more properties and examples).
For instance dg-geometry is the study of the (∞,1)-topos over an (∞,1)-site of formal duals of dg-algebras. Again there is the canonical ∞-stack
QC:SpecA↦AMod
  QC : Spec A \mapsto A Mod


on this site, where now however AModA Mod denotes the ∞-groupoid (or (∞,1)-category if we do a more comprehensive discussion) of chain complexes equipped with the structure of a module ove the dg-algebra AA.
For XX any ∞-stack then a morphism
ρ:X→QC
  \rho : X \to QC


is a equivalently a quasicoherent ∞-stack of modules on XX, or an ∞\infty-representation with “dg-algebraic structure”.
If one replaces XX here by its de Rham stack X dRX_{dR} then dg-algebraic ∞\infty-representations
ρ:X dR→QC
  \rho : X_{dR} \to QC


are D-modules on XX.
A discussion of these higher categorical structure in representation theory is in (Ben-ZviNadler).
nn-Representations
If the codomain ModMod is not an (∞,1)-category that is just a (n,1)-category (all k-morphismss for k>nk \gt n are effectively identities) then an ∞\infty-representation is called an nn-representation. These are representations up to homotopy where from degree nn on all homotopies are actually identities: nn-truncated representations up to homotopy.
As always in higher category theory, the cases for low nn are more restrictive but typically admit a more tractable detailed analysis and construction.
2-representations of 2-groups and Lie 2-groups on various variants of 2-vector spaces have been considered for instance in (Schreiber, BaezBaratinFreidelWise, and other places).
In analogy to the case for n=1n=1, 2-Representations P 2(X)→2Vect\mathbf{P}_2(X) \to 2 Vect of the smooth path 2-groupoid of a smooth manifold describe connections on a 2-bundle. See there for more details.
An associated ∞\infty-bundle E→XE \to X is a fiber bundle in an (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} with typical fiber F∈HF \in \mathbf{H} that is classified by a cocycle X→BAut̲(F)X \to \mathbf{B}\underline{Aut}(F) with coefficients in the delooping of the internal automorphism ∞-group of FF. We say this is associated to the corresponding Aut̲(F)\underline{Aut}(F)-principal ∞-bundle.
More generally there should be notions of associated ∞\infty-bundles whose fibers are objects in an (∞,n)-topos over H\mathbf{H} for some n>1n \gt 1.
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos.

Definition
For V,X∈HV,X \in \mathbf{H} two objects, say a VV-fiber ∞-bundle over XX is a morphism E→XE \to X (an object in the slice (∞,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}) such that there exists an effective epimorphism U→XU \to X and an (∞,1)-pullback square
U×V → E ↓  ↓ U → X.
  \array{
    U \times V &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    U &\to& X
  }
  \,.



Definition
Let G∈Grp(H)G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) be an ∞-group equipped with an ∞-action ρ\rho on VV. Then for P→XP \to X a GG-principal ∞-bundle over XX, the ρ\rho-associated ∞\infty-bundle is
P× GV→X,
  P \times_G V \to X
  \,,


where P× GV:=(P×V)//GP \times_G V := (P \times V)//G is the homotopy quotient of the diagonal GG-action.


Remark
Below in Properties we see that every ρ\rho-associated ∞\infty-bundle is a VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle and that every VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle arises as associated to an Aut(V)\mathbf{Aut}(V)-principal ∞-bundle

Let H\mathbf{H} be an ambient (∞,1)-topos. Let V,XV, X be two objects of H\mathbf{H}. Then a VV-fiber bundle over XX in H\mathbf{H} is a morphism E→XE \to X such that there is an effective epimorphism U→XU \to X and an (∞,1)-pullback square of the form
U×V → E ↓  ↓ U → X.
  \array{
    U \times V &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    U &\to& X
  }
  \,.


Externally this is a VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle.

Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
The notion of principal ∞\infty-bundle is a categorification of principal bundle from groups and groupoids to ∞-groupoids, or rather from parameterized groupoids (generalized spaces called stacks) to parameterized ∞\infty-groupoids (generalized spaces called ∞-stacks).

groupal model for universal principal ∞-bundles.


We define GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles in the general context of an ∞-stack (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}, with GG a group object in the (∞,1)-topos.
Recall that for A∈HA \in \mathbf{H} an object equipped with a point pt A:*→Apt_A : {*} \to A , its corresponding loop space object ΩA\Omega A is the homotopy pullback
ΩA → * ↓  ↓ * → A.
  \array{
    \Omega A &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    {*} &\to& A
  }
  \,.


Conversely, for G∈HG \in \mathbf{H} we say an object BG\mathbf{B}G is a delooping of GG if it has an essentially unique point and if G≃ΩBGG \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}G. We call GG an ∞-group. More in detail, its structure as a group object in an (∞,1)-category is exhibited by the ?ech nerve?

We discuss now that PP canonically has the structure of a GG-principal ∞-bundle and that BG\mathbf{B}G is the fine moduli space for GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles.

Definition
(principal GG-action)
Let GG be a group object in the (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}. A principal action of GG on a morphism (P→X)∈H(P \to X) \in \mathbf{H} is a groupoid object P//GP//G that sits over *//G*//G in that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams Δ op→H\Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H}
⋮  ⋮ P×G×G →(p 2,p 3) G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓ P → *
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    P \times G \times G
    &\stackrel{(p_2, p_3)}{\to}& G \times G
    \\
   \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow 
    && \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P \times G
    &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& G
    \\
    \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P &\stackrel{}{\to}& {*}
  }


in H\mathbf{H};
and such that P→XP \to X exhibits the (∞,1)-colimit
X≃lim →(P//G:Δ op→H)
  X \simeq \lim_\to (P//G : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H})


called the base space over which the action takes place.

We may think of P//GP//G as the action groupoid of the GG-action on PP. For us it defines this GG-action.

Proposition
The GG-principal action as defined above satisfies the principality condition in that we have an equivalence of groupoid objects
⋮  ⋮ P× XP× XP →≃ P×G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P× XP →≃ P×G ↓↓  ↓↓ P →≃ P.
   \array{
     \vdots && \vdots
     \\
     P \times_X P \times_X P
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
     P \times G \times G
     \\
    \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow 
     && \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
     \\
     P \times_X P
     &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& 
     P \times G
     \\
     \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
     \\
     P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P
   }
   \,.
 


Proof
This principality condition asserts that the groupoid object P//GP//G is effective. By Giraud's axioms characterizing (∞,1)-toposes, every groupoid object in H\mathbf{H} is effective.


Proposition
For X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G any morphism, its homotopy fiber P→XP \to X is canonically equipped with a principal GG-action with base space XX.


Proof
First we show that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams
⋮  ⋮  ⋮ P× XP× XP →≃ P×G×G → G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P× XP →≃ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓  ↓↓ P →= P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ X →= X →g BG,
  \array{
    \vdots && \vdots && \vdots
    \\
    P \times_X P \times_X P 
    &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P \times G \times G
    &\to& G \times G
    \\
    \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
    && 
   \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow 
    && \downarrow\downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P \times_X P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P \times G
    &\stackrel{p_2}{\to}& G
    \\
    \downarrow\downarrow
    && \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
    \\
    P &\stackrel{=}{\to}& P &\stackrel{}{\to}& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    X &\stackrel{=}{\to}& X &\stackrel{g}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,,


with the right square swhere the left horizontal morphisms are equivalences, as indicated. We proceed by induction through the height of this diagram.
The defining (∞,1)-pullback square for P× XPP \times_X P is
P× XP → P ↓  ↓ P → X
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X
  }


To compute this, we may attach the defining (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback square of PP to obtain the pasting diagram
P× XP → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


and use the pasting law for pullbacks, to conclude that P× XPP \times_X P is the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


By definition of PP as the homotopy fiber of X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G, the lower horizontal morphism is equivbalent to P→*→BGP \to {*} \to \mathbf{B}G, so that P× XPP \times_X P is also equivalent to the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


This finally may be computed as the pasting of two pullbacks
P× XP ≃ P×G → G → *   ↓  ↓  ↓   P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\simeq& P \times G &\to& G &\to& {*}
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    &&P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


of which the one on the right is the defining one for GG and the remaining one on the left is just an (∞,1)-product.
Proceeding by induction from this case we find analogously that P × X n+1≃P×G × nP^{\times_X^{n+1}} \simeq P \times G^{\times_n}: suppose this has been shown for (n−1)(n-1), then the defining pullback square for P × X n+1P^{\times_X^{n+1}} is
P× XP × X n → P ↓  ↓ P × X n → X.
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X
  }
  \,.


We may again paste this to obtain
P× XP × X n → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P × X n → X → BG
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    &\to&
    *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
  }


and use from the previous induction step that
(P × X n→X→BG)≃(P × X n→*→BG)
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to X \to \mathbf{B}G) 
  \simeq
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to * \to \mathbf{B}G)


to conclude the induction step with the same arguments as before.
This shows that P//GP//G is the Cech nerve of P→XP \to X. It remains to show that indeed X=lim → nP×G × nX = {\lim_\to}_n P \times G^{\times^n}. For this notice that *→BG* \to \mathbf{B}G is an effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category. Hence so is P→XP \to X. This proves the claim, by definition of effective epimorphism.
using this we have
X ≃BG∏ BGX  ≃(lim → nG × n)∏ BGX  ≃lim → n(G × n∏ BGX)  ≃lim → n(P×G × n)  ≃lim →P//G.
  \begin{aligned}
    X & \simeq \mathbf{B}G \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
    \\
      & \simeq \left({\lim_{\to}}_n G^{\times^n}\right) \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_{\to}}_n ( G^{\times^n} \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to}_n ( P\times G^{\times^n} )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to} P//G
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


We have established that every cocycle X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G canonically induced a GG-principal action on the homotopy fiber P→XP \to X. The following definition declares the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles to be those GG-principal actions that do arise this way.

Definition
We say a GG-principal action of GG on PP over XX is a GG-principal ∞-bundle if the colimit over P//G→*//GP//G \to *//G produces a pullback square: the bottom square in
⋮  ⋮ P×G×G → G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓ P → * ↓  ↓ X=lim →(P×G •) →g BG=lim →(G •).

  \,.



Definition
For GG an infinity-group in H\mathbf{H} and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} any object, write
GBund(X)⊂Grpd(H)/*//G
  G Bund(X) \subset Grpd(\mathbf{H})/{*//G}


for the sub-(infinity,1)-category on the over-(infinity,1)-category of the groupoid objects over *//G*//G on the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles as above.


Proposition
We have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
GBund(X)≃H(X,BG)
  G Bund(X) \simeq \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)


of GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles over XX with cocycles X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G.


Proof
The arrow category H I\mathbf{H}^I is still an (infinity,1)-topos and hence the Giraud-Lurie axioms still hold. This means that by the discussion at groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category (using the statement below HTT, cor. 6.2.3.5) we have an equivalence
Grpd(H I)≃(H I) eff I
  Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I) \simeq 
  (\mathbf{H}^{I})^{I}_{eff}


between groupoid objects in H I\mathbf{H}^I and effective epimorphisms in the arrow category.
Notice that groupoid objects and effective epis in H I\mathbf{H}^I are given objectwise over the two objects of the interval I=Δ[1]I = \Delta[1].
Restricting this equivalence along the inclusion
H(X,BG)↪(H I) I
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
    \hookrightarrow
  (\mathbf{H}^I)^I


given by sending a cocycle to its homotopy fiber diagram
(X→BG)↦(P → * ↓  ↓ X → BG)
 (X \to \mathbf{B}G)
  \mapsto 
  \left(
     \array{
        P &\to& * 
        \\
        \downarrow && \downarrow
        \\
        X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
     }
  \right)


therefore yields precisely the equivalence in question
GBund(X) ↪ Grpd(H I) ↓ ≃  ↓ ≃ H(X,BG) ↪hofib (H I) I.
  \array{
     G Bund(X) &\hookrightarrow& Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I)
     \\
     \downarrow^\simeq && \downarrow^\simeq
     \\
     \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{hofib}{\hookrightarrow}&
     (\mathbf{H}^I)^I
  }
  \,.


In words this says that the cohomology on XX with coefficients in GG classified GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles, and in fact does so on the level of cocycles.
Connections on GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles
For some comments on the generalization of the notion of connection on a bundle to principal ∞\infty-bundles see differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos – survey.
The notion of principal ∞\infty-bundle is a categorification of principal bundle from groups and groupoids to ∞-groupoids, or rather from parameterized groupoids (generalized spaces called stacks) to parameterized ∞\infty-groupoids (generalized spaces called ∞-stacks).

Conversely, for G∈HG \in \mathbf{H} we say an object BG\mathbf{B}G is a delooping of GG if it has an essentially unique point and if G≃ΩBGG \simeq \Omega \mathbf{B}G. We call GG an ∞-group. More in detail, its structure as a group object in an (∞,1)-category is exhibited by the ?ech nerve?

We discuss now that PP canonically has the structure of a GG-principal ∞-bundle and that BG\mathbf{B}G is the fine moduli space for GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles.

Definition
(principal GG-action)
Let GG be a group object in the (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H}. A principal action of GG on a morphism (P→X)∈H(P \to X) \in \mathbf{H} is a groupoid object P//GP//G that sits over *//G*//G in that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams Δ op→H\Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H}

in H\mathbf{H};
and such that P→XP \to X exhibits the (∞,1)-colimit
X≃lim →(P//G:Δ op→H)
  X \simeq \lim_\to (P//G : \Delta^{op} \to \mathbf{H})


called the base space over which the action takes place.

We may think of P//GP//G as the action groupoid of the GG-action on PP. For us it defines this GG-action.

Proposition
The GG-principal action as defined above satisfies the principality condition in that we have an equivalence of groupoid objects
⋮  ⋮ P× XP× XP →≃ P×G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P× XP →≃ P×G ↓↓  ↓↓ P →≃ P.
   \array{
     \vdots && \vdots
     \\

     P \times G \times G

     \\
     \downarrow\downarrow && \downarrow\downarrow
     \\
     P &\stackrel{\simeq}{\to}& P
   }
   \,.
 


Proof
This principality condition asserts that the groupoid object P//GP//G is effective. By Giraud's axioms characterizing (∞,1)-toposes, every groupoid object in H\mathbf{H} is effective.


Proposition
For X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G any morphism, its homotopy fiber P→XP \to X is canonically equipped with a principal GG-action with base space XX.

First we show that we have a morphism of simplicial diagrams

with the right square swhere the left horizontal morphisms are equivalences, as indicated. We proceed by induction through the height of this diagram.
The defining (∞,1)-pullback square for P× XPP \times_X P is
P× XP → P ↓  ↓ P → X
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X
  }


To compute this, we may attach the defining (∞,1)(\infty,1)-pullback square of PP to obtain the pasting diagram
P× XP → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& P &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


and use the pasting law for pullbacks, to conclude that P× XPP \times_X P is the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → X → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


By definition of PP as the homotopy fiber of X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G, the lower horizontal morphism is equivbalent to P→*→BGP \to {*} \to \mathbf{B}G, so that P× XPP \times_X P is also equivalent to the pullback
P× XP →  → * ↓    ↓ P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\to& &\to& {*}
    \\
    \downarrow && && \downarrow
    \\
    P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


This finally may be computed as the pasting of two pullbacks
P× XP ≃ P×G → G → *   ↓  ↓  ↓   P → * → BG.
  \array{
    P \times_X P &\simeq& P \times G &\to& G &\to& {*}
    \\
    &&\downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    &&P &\to& {*} &\to& \mathbf{B}G
    \,.
  }


of which the one on the right is the defining one for GG and the remaining one on the left is just an (∞,1)-product.
Proceeding by induction from this case we find analogously that P × X n+1≃P×G × nP^{\times_X^{n+1}} \simeq P \times G^{\times_n}: suppose this has been shown for (n−1)(n-1), then the defining pullback square for P × X n+1P^{\times_X^{n+1}} is
P× XP × X n → P ↓  ↓ P × X n → X.
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X
  }
  \,.


We may again paste this to obtain
P× XP × X n → P → * ↓  ↓  ↓ P × X n → X → BG
  \array{
    P \times_X P^{\times_X^n}
    &\to&
    P
    &\to&
    *
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    P^{\times_X^n}&\to& X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
  }


and use from the previous induction step that
(P × X n→X→BG)≃(P × X n→*→BG)
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to X \to \mathbf{B}G) 
  \simeq
  (P^{\times_X^n} \to * \to \mathbf{B}G)


to conclude the induction step with the same arguments as before.
This shows that P//GP//G is the Cech nerve of P→XP \to X. It remains to show that indeed X=lim → nP×G × nX = {\lim_\to}_n P \times G^{\times^n}. For this notice that *→BG* \to \mathbf{B}G is an effective epimorphism in an (infinity,1)-category. Hence so is P→XP \to X. This proves the claim, by definition of effective epimorphism.
using this we have
X ≃BG∏ BGX  ≃(lim → nG × n)∏ BGX  ≃lim → n(G × n∏ BGX)  ≃lim → n(P×G × n)  ≃lim →P//G.
  \begin{aligned}
    X & \simeq \mathbf{B}G \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
    \\
      & \simeq \left({\lim_{\to}}_n G^{\times^n}\right) \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_{\to}}_n ( G^{\times^n} \prod_{\mathbf{B}G} X )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to}_n ( P\times G^{\times^n} )
      \\
      & \simeq {\lim_\to} P//G
  \end{aligned}
  \,.


We have established that every cocycle X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G canonically induced a GG-principal action on the homotopy fiber P→XP \to X. The following definition declares the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles to be those GG-principal actions that do arise this way.

Definition
We say a GG-principal action of GG on PP over XX is a GG-principal ∞-bundle if the colimit over P//G→*//GP//G \to *//G produces a pullback square: the bottom square in
⋮  ⋮ P×G×G → G×G ↓↓↓  ↓↓↓ P×G →p 2 G ↓↓  ↓↓ P → * ↓  ↓ X=lim →(P×G •) →g BG=lim →(G •).

Definition
For GG an infinity-group in H\mathbf{H} and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} any object, write
GBund(X)⊂Grpd(H)/*//G
  G Bund(X) \subset Grpd(\mathbf{H})/{*//G}


for the sub-(infinity,1)-category on the over-(infinity,1)-category of the groupoid objects over *//G*//G on the GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles as above.


Proposition
We have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
GBund(X)≃H(X,BG)
  G Bund(X) \simeq \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)


of GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles over XX with cocycles X→BGX \to \mathbf{B}G.


Proof
The arrow category H I\mathbf{H}^I is still an (infinity,1)-topos and hence the Giraud-Lurie axioms still hold. This means that by the discussion at groupoid object in an (infinity,1)-category (using the statement below HTT, cor. 6.2.3.5) we have an equivalence
Grpd(H I)≃(H I) eff I
  Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I) \simeq 
  (\mathbf{H}^{I})^{I}_{eff}


between groupoid objects in H I\mathbf{H}^I and effective epimorphisms in the arrow category.
Notice that groupoid objects and effective epis in H I\mathbf{H}^I are given objectwise over the two objects of the interval I=Δ[1]I = \Delta[1].
Restricting this equivalence along the inclusion
H(X,BG)↪(H I) I
  \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
    \hookrightarrow
  (\mathbf{H}^I)^I


given by sending a cocycle to its homotopy fiber diagram
(X→BG)↦(P → * ↓  ↓ X → BG)
 (X \to \mathbf{B}G)
  \mapsto 
  \left(
     \array{
        P &\to& * 
        \\
        \downarrow && \downarrow
        \\
        X &\to& \mathbf{B}G
     }
  \right)


therefore yields precisely the equivalence in question
GBund(X) ↪ Grpd(H I) ↓ ≃  ↓ ≃ H(X,BG) ↪hofib (H I) I.
  \array{
     G Bund(X) &\hookrightarrow& Grpd(\mathbf{H}^I)
     \\
     \downarrow^\simeq && \downarrow^\simeq
     \\
     \mathbf{H}(X, \mathbf{B}G)
     &\stackrel{hofib}{\hookrightarrow}&
     (\mathbf{H}^I)^I
  }
  \,.


In words this says that the cohomology on XX with coefficients in GG classified GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles, and in fact does so on the level of cocycles.
Connections on GG-principal ∞\infty-bundles
For some comments on the generalization of the notion of connection on a bundle to principal ∞\infty-bundles see differential cohomology in an (∞,1)-topos – survey.
A homotopy pullback is a special kind of homotopy limit: the appropriate notion of pullback in the context of homotopy theory. Homotopy pullbacks model the quasi-category pullbacks in the (infinity,1)-category that is presented by a given homotopical category. Since pullbacks are also called fiber products, homotopy pullbacks are also called homotopy fiber products.
The notion of homotopy pushout is the dual concept.
For more details see homotopy limit.
In the context of homotopy type theory a homotopy pullback is the interpretation of the space of solutions to an equation.
In category theory
As with all homotopy limits, there is both a local and a global notion of homotopy pullback.
The global definition says that the homotopy pullback of a cospan X→Z←YX \to Z \leftarrow Y in a category with weak equivalences CC is its image under the right derived functor of the base change functor pb:C →←→Cpb: C^{\to \leftarrow} \to C.
The local definition says that the homotopy pullback of X→Z←YX \to Z \leftarrow Y in a category with a notion of homotopy consists of a square
P → Y ↓  ↓ X → Z
  \array{
   P & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }


that commutes up to homotopy, and such that for any other square
T → Y ↓  ↓ X → Z
  \array{
   T & \to& Y
   \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
   \\
   X &\to& Z
  }


that commutes up to homotopy, there exists a morphism T→PT\to P, unique up to homotopy, making the two triangles commute up to homotopy, and similarly for homotopies and higher homotopies. In other words, there is an equivalence
Map(T,P)≃HoSq(T,X→Z←Y)Map(T,P) \simeq HoSq(T,X\to Z\leftarrow Y)
between the space of maps T→PT\to P and the space of homotopy commutative squares with vertex TT.
In good situations, such as when X,Y,ZX,Y,Z are fibrant in a model category, the two constructions agree up to weak equivalence.
Note that in both cases, there is a canonical map from the actual pullback X× ZYX\times_Z Y to the homotopy pullback X× Z hYX\times_Z^h Y. In the global case this comes by the definition of a derived functor; in the local case it comes because a commutative square is, in particular, a homotopy commutative one.
In homotopy type theory
In homotopy type theory the homotopy pullback of a term of function type
f:A→C
  f : A \to C


along a term of function type
g:B→C
  g : B \to C


is given formally by precisely the same formula that would also define the ordinary fiber product of functions of sets, namely by
{a:A,b:B|f(a)=g(b)}.
  \left\{
     a : A, b : B \;\; | \;\; f(a) = g(b)
  \right\}
  \,.


Spelled out, this is the dependent sum
∑a:A b:B(f(a)=g(b))
  \underset{
    \array{
      {a \colon A}  
      \\
      {b\colon B}
    }
   }{\sum} 
   \big(
     f(a) = g(b)
   \big)


over the dependent identity type over the evaluation of ff and gg.
What in classical logic is interpreted as the set of pairs (a,b)(a,b) such that f(a)f(a) and g(b)g(b) are equal here becomes the restriction of a mapping cocylinder.
Formal proof that this is the homotopy pullback in homotopy type theory is in (Brunerie). Proof in the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory is below.
Fiber-wise characterization

Proposition
In plain homotopy types (i.e. in ∞-groupoids, in the classical model structure on simplicial sets etc.) the following holds:
a diagram
A ⟶f B ↓  ↓ p C ⟶g D
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    C &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& D
  }


is a homotopy pullback diagram precisely if it induces a weak equivalence on all homotopy fibers
hfib b(f) ⟶ A ⟶f B ↓ ≃  ↓  ↓ p hfib p(b)(g) ⟶ C ⟶g D
  \array{
    hfib_b(f) &\longrightarrow& A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}  && \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    hfib_{p(b)}(g) &\longrightarrow& C &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& D
  }


for all elements b∈Bb \in B.

(e.g. CPS 05, 5.2, MO)

Remark
For the analog of prop.  to hold in (∞,1)-categories more general than ∞-groupoids one would need either “enough global elements” of the object BB to detect all homotopy fibers, or else one would need a suitable “internal” formulation of the statement.

On the other hand in stable homotopy theory the statement holds generally:

Proposition
For 𝒞\mathcal{C} a stable model category, then for a diagram
A ⟶f B ↓  ↓ p C ⟶g D
  \array{
    A &\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}& B
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p}}
    \\
    C &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& D
  }


the following are equivalent


the square is a homotopy pullback square;


the square is a homotopy pushout squre;


the induced morphism on the homotopy fiber over the zero object 0 is a weak equivalence
hfib 0(f)⟶≃hfib 0(g).
   hfib_0(f) \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} hfib_0(g)
   \,.




A proof in terms of stable model categories including the third item is spelled out for instance in (Hovey 07, remark 7.1.12). (Beware: this is not in the original volume from 1999, but is in the version “reprinted with corrections” from 2007.) A proof in terms of stable (∞,1)-categories is in (Lurie HA, prop. 1.1.3.4 (2) lemma 1.2.4.14).

A universal principal ∞-bundle over an ∞-group-object in an (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} is a morphism EG→BG\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G in a 1-categorical model CC for H\mathbf{H} (a homotopical category) such that every GG-principal ∞-bundle P→XP \to X in H\mathbf{H} is modeled in CC by an (ordinary) pullback of EG→BG\mathbf{E}G \to \mathbf{B}G.
Notice that in the proper (∞,1)-topos-context the universal GG-principal ∞-bundle for an ∞-group GG is nothing but the point inclusion *→BG* \to \mathbf{B}G into the delooping of GG: every GG-principal ∞\infty-bundle P→XP \to X is the (∞,1)-pullback
P → * ↓  ≃⇙ ↓ X → BG
  \array{
    P &\to& *
    \\
    \downarrow &{}^{\mathllap{\simeq}}\swArrow& \downarrow 
    \\
    X &\stackrel{}{\to}& \mathbf{B}G
  }


of the point in H\mathbf{H}, namely the homotopy kernel of its classifying map gg. In other words, in a full (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categorical context the notion of universal bundle disappears. It is a notion genuinely associated with 1-categorical models for H\mathbf{H}.
An element of a set is a thing which “belongs to,” or “is an element of,” that set.
The circularity of this definition is unavoidable in foundational set theories in which “set” is an undefined term. In “definitional” set theories, where “set” is defined in terms of something else, elements are likewise defined in terms of the same “something else.”
If sets (or setoids) are regarded as the semantics of some type theory, then an element of a set is the interpretation of a term of some type.
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} any object, the over-(∞,1)-category H/X\mathbf{H}/X is itself an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos: the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos (the fundamental theorem of 


∞

\infty

-topos theory).
If we think of H\mathbf{H} as a big topos, then for X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} we may think of H/X∈\mathbf{H}/X \in  (∞,1)-topos as the little topos-incarnation of XX. The objects of H/X\mathbf{H}/X we may think of as (∞,1)-sheaves on XX.
This correspondence between objects of XX and their little-topos incarnation is entirly natural: H\mathbf{H} is equivalently recovered as the (∞,1)-category whose objects are over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes H/X\mathbf{H}/X and whose morphisms are (∞,1)-geometric morphisms over H\mathbf{H}.

Proposition
For H\mathbf{H} an (∞,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object also the over-(∞,1)-category H/X\mathbf{H}/X is an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos. This is the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos of H\mathbf{H} over XX.

This is HTT, prop 6.3.5.1 (1).
Base change to the point

Proposition
There is a canonical (∞,1)-geometric morphism
H/X⟶X *⟵X *⟶X !H
  \mathbf{H}/X 
    \stackrel{\overset{X_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{X^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{X_*}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}


where the extra left adjoint X !X_! is the obvious projection X !:(Y→X)↦XX_! : (Y \to X) \mapsto X, and X *X_* is given by forming the (∞,1)-product with XX.

This is called an etale geometric morphism. See there for more details.

Proof
The fact that (X !⊣X *)(X_! \dashv X^*) follows from the universal property of the products. The fact that X *X^* preserves (∞,1)-colimits and hence has a further right adjoint X *X_* by the adjoint (∞,1)-functor theorem follows from that fact that H\mathbf{H} has universal colimits.


Corollary
If H\mathbf{H} is a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos then for all X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} also the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H/X\mathbf{H}/X is locally ∞\infty-connected.


Proof
The composite of (∞,1)-geometric morphisms
H/X⟶X *⟵X *⟶X !H⟶Γ H⟵LConst H⟶Π H∞Grpd
  \mathbf{H}/X 
    \stackrel{\overset{X_!}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{X^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{X_*}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \mathbf{H}
  \stackrel{\overset{\Pi_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longrightarrow}}{\stackrel{\overset{LConst_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longleftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma_{\mathbf{H}}}{\longrightarrow}}}
  \infty Grpd


is itself a geometric morphism. Since ∞Grpd is the terminal object in (∞,1)Topos this must be the global section geometric morphism for H/X\mathbf{H}/X. Since it has the extra left adjoint Π∘X !\Pi \circ X_! it is locally ∞\infty-connected.


Proposition
Let ((∞,1)Topos/H) et⊂(∞,1)Topos/H((\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H})_{et} \subset (\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H} be the full sub-(∞,1)-category on the etale geometric morphisms H/X→H\mathbf{H}/X \to \mathbf{H}. Then there is an equivalence
((∞,1)Topos/H) et≃H
  ((\infty,1)Topos/\mathbf{H})_{et}
  \simeq
  \mathbf{H}

As (∞,1)(\infty,1)-sheaves on the big (∞,1)(\infty,1)-site of an object
We spell out how H/X\mathbf{H}/X is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves over the big site of XX.
The following may be seen as the presheaf version of the fundamental theorem of 


∞

\infty

-topos theory.

Proposition
(forming overcategories commutes with passing to presheaves)
Let CC be a small (∞,1)-category and X:K⟶CX \colon K \longrightarrow C a diagram. Write C /XC_{/X} and PSh(C) /XPSh(C)_{/X} for the corresponding over (∞,1)-categories, where – notationally implicitly – we use the (∞,1)-Yoneda embedding C↪PSh(C)C \hookrightarrow PSh(C).
Then we have an equivalence of (∞,1)-categories
PSh(C /X)⟶≃PSh(C) /X.
  PSh\big(
    C_{/X}
  \big) 
  \stackrel{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} 
  PSh(C)_{/X}
  \,.


This appears as HTT, 5.1.6.12. For more on this see (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves.

Remark
Here we may think of C/XC/X as the big site of the object c∈PSh(C)c \in PSh(C), hence of PSh(C/X)PSh(C/X) as presheaves on XX.


Proposition
Let CC be equipped with a subcanonical coverage, let X∈CX \in C and regard C/XC/X as an (∞,1)-site with the big site-coverage. Then we have
Sh(C/X)≃Sh(C)/X.
  Sh(C/X) \simeq Sh(C)/X
  \,.



Proof
By the discussion of adjoint (∞,1)-functors on over-(∞,1)-categories adjoint (∞,1)-functors we have that the adjunction
(F⊣i):Sh(C)↪←FPSh(C)
  (F \dashv i) : Sh(C) \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)


passes to an adjunction on the over-(∞,1)-categories
(F/X⊣i/X):Sh(C)/X↪←FPSh(C)/X,
  (F/X \dashv i/X) : Sh(C)/X \stackrel{\overset{F}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  PSh(C)/X
  \,,


(where we are using that FiX≃XF  i X \simeq X by the assumption that the coverage is subcanonical, so that the representable XX is a (∞,1)-sheaf), such that i/Xi/X is still a full and faithful (∞,1)-functor (where we are using that the unit X→FiXX \to F i X is an equivalence, since XX is a sheaf).
Since moreover the (∞,1)-limits in Sh(C)/XSh(C)/X are computed as limits in Sh(C)Sh(C) over diagrams with a bottom element adjoined (as discussed at limits in over-(∞,1)-categories) it follows that with FF preserving all finite limits, so does F/XF/X.
In summary we have that (F/X⊣i/X)(F/X \dashv i/X) is a reflective sub-(∞,1)-category of PSh(C/X)PSh(C/X) hence is the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-sheaves on the category C/XC/X for some (∞,1)-site-structure. But since F/XF/X inverts precisely those morphisms that are inverted by FF under the projection PSh(C)/X→PSh(C)PSh(C)/X \to PSh(C), it follows that this is the big site structure on C/XC/X (this is the defining property of the big site).

Specifically for the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞Grpd we also have the following characterization.

Proposition
For H=\mathbf{H} =  ∞Grpd we have that for X∈∞GrpX \in \infty Grp any ∞-groupoid the corresponding over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos is equivalent to the (∞,1)-category of (∞,1)-presheaves on XX:
∞Grpd/X≃PSh(X)≃[X,∞Grpd].
  \infty Grpd/X \simeq PSh(X) \simeq [X, \infty Grpd]
  \,.



Proof
This is a special case of the (∞,1)-Grothendieck construction. See the section (∞,0)-fibrations over ∞-groupoids.

The following proposition asserts that the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over an nn-truncated object indeed behaves like a generalized n-groupoid


Proposition
For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} and 𝒳\mathcal{X} an n-localic (∞,1)-topos, then the over-(∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos 𝒳/U\mathcal{X}/U is nn-localic precisely if the object UU is nn-truncated.


This is (StrSp, lemma 2.3.16).
Object classifier
If Obj κ∈HObj_\kappa \in \mathbf{H} is an object classifier for κ\kappa-small objects, then the projection Obj Κ×X→XObj_\Kappa \times X \to X regarded as an object in the slice is a κ\kappa-small object classifier in H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}.
In homotopy type theory
If a homotopy type theory is the internal language of H\mathbf{H}, then then theory in context x:X⊢⋯x : X \vdash \cdots is the internal language of H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}.
Explicitly
A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.


See at dependent product – In terms of spaces of sections for more on this.
An associated ∞\infty-bundle E→XE \to X is a fiber bundle in an (∞,1)-topos H\mathbf{H} with typical fiber F∈HF \in \mathbf{H} that is classified by a cocycle X→BAut̲(F)X \to \mathbf{B}\underline{Aut}(F) with coefficients in the delooping of the internal automorphism ∞-group of FF. We say this is associated to the corresponding Aut̲(F)\underline{Aut}(F)-principal ∞-bundle.
More generally there should be notions of associated ∞\infty-bundles whose fibers are objects in an (∞,n)-topos over H\mathbf{H} for some n>1n \gt 1.
Let H\mathbf{H} be an (∞,1)-topos.

Definition
For V,X∈HV,X \in \mathbf{H} two objects, say a VV-fiber ∞-bundle over XX is a morphism E→XE \to X (an object in the slice (∞,1)-topos H /X\mathbf{H}_{/X}) such that there exists an effective epimorphism U→XU \to X and an (∞,1)-pullback square
U×V → E ↓  ↓ U → X.

    U \times V &\to& E

Definition
Let G∈Grp(H)G \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) be an ∞-group equipped with an ∞-action ρ\rho on VV. Then for P→XP \to X a GG-principal ∞-bundle over XX, the ρ\rho-associated ∞\infty-bundle is
P× GV→X,
  P \times_G V \to X
  \,,


where P× GV:=(P×V)//GP \times_G V := (P \times V)//G is the homotopy quotient of the diagonal GG-action.


Remark
Below in Properties we see that every ρ\rho-associated ∞\infty-bundle is a VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle and that every VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle arises as associated to an Aut(V)\mathbf{Aut}(V)-principal ∞-bundle

Let H\mathbf{H} be an ambient (∞,1)-topos. Let V,XV, X be two objects of H\mathbf{H}. Then a VV-fiber bundle over XX in H\mathbf{H} is a morphism E→XE \to X such that there is an effective epimorphism U→XU \to X and an (∞,1)-pullback square of the form
U×V → E ↓  ↓ U → X.
  \array{
    U \times V &\to& E
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow
    \\
    U &\to& X
  }
  \,.


Externally this is a VV-fiber ∞\infty-bundle.
See at associated ∞-bundle for more.
A gauge theory may denote either a classical field theory or a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in differential cohomology (abelian or nonabelian).
Ordinary gauge theories
An ordinary gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are vector bundles with connection.
This includes notably the fields that carry the three fundamental forces of the standard model of particle physics:


Ordinary electromagnetism in the absence of magnetic charges is a gauge theory of U(1)U(1)-principal bundles with connection.


Fields in Yang-Mills theory (such as appearing in the standard model of particle physics and in GUTs) are vector bundles with connection.


Other examples include formal physical models.

Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a gauge theory whose field configurations are GG-principal bundles for GG a finite group (these come with a unique connection, so that in this simple case the connection is no extra datum).

The group GG in these examples is called the gauge group of the theory.
Higher and generalized gauge theories
The above examples of gauge fields consisted of cocycles in degree-11 differential cohomology.
More generally, a higher gauge theory is a quantum field theory whose field configurations are cocycles in more general differential cohomology, for instance higher degree Deligne cocycles or more generally cocycles in other differential refinements, such as in differential K-theory.
This generalization does contain experimentally visible physics such as

The magnetic current in electromagnetism is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle refining a cocycle in degree-33 Eilenberg-MacLane cohomology: the magnetic charge .

But a whole tower of higher and generalized gauge theories became visible with the study of higher supergravity theories,


The Kalb-Ramond field is a bundle gerbe with connection, a Deligne cocycle with curvature 3-form.


The supergravity C-field is a Deligne cocycle with curvature 4-form.


The RR-field is a cocycle in differential K-theory.


Gravity as a (non-)gauge theory
In the first order formulation of gravity also the theory of gravity looks a little like a gauge theory. However, there is a crucial difference. What really happens here is Cartan geometry: the field of gravity may be encoded in a vielbein field, namelely an orthogonal structure on the tangent bundle, hence as an example of a G-structure, and the torsion freedom of this G-structure may be encoded by an auxiliary connection, namely a Cartan connection, often called the “spin connection” in this context. Hence while in the formulation of Cartan geometry gravity is described by many of the ingredients from differential geometry that also govern pure gauge theory, it’s not quite the same. In particular there is a constraint on a Cartan connection, which in terms of vielbein fields is the constraint that the vielbein (which is part of the Cartan connection) is non-degenerate, and hence really a “soldering form”. Such a constraint is absent in a “genuine” gauge theory such as Yang-Mills theory or Chern-Simons theory.
Non-redundancy and locality
Sometimes one see the view expressed that gauge symmetry is “just a redundancy” in the description of a theory of physics, for instance in that among observables it is only the gauge invariant ones which are physically meaningful.
This statement however
Anomalies
In the presence of magnetic charge (and then even in the absence of chiral fermion anomalies?) the standard would-be action functional for higher gauge theories may be ill-defined. The Green-Schwarz mechanism is a famous phenomenon in differential cohomology by which such a quantum anomaly cancels against that given by chiral fermions.
The notion of representation is closely related to, or even identical, to that of action: some object CC that has a notion of composition is represented on some object DD that has a notion of composition. In this generality representation is just another word for functor (or potentially ∞\infty-functor). But in practice the term representation is typically used in the context of representation theory, where we attempt to study CC in terms of its representations in DD, where DD is typically rather more familiar.
Most specifically, one studies representations of a group by linear endomorphisms of a vector space; that is, CC is (the delooping of) a group and DD is Vect. However, the typical tools in representation theory these days involve vast generalizations of the notion of a linear representation of a group; for instance, one studies D-modules on action groupoids G// AdGG //_{Ad}G and things like that. This may be thought of as studying representations with values in ∞-vector spaces.
In physics there are (at least) two different concepts that go by the name gauge group:


a local gauge group GG is a structure group of GG-principal bundles in the configuration space of a classical gauge theory: it acts by gauge transformations on the space of field configurations.


a global gauge group is a group of automorphisms that acts on the (local net of) observables of a quantum field theory.


Notably after quantization the gauge group in the first sense does not become a gauge group in the second sense. On the contrary, observables in quantum field theory are required not to depend on gauge transformations in the first sense, and part of what makes quantization of gauge theory nontrivial is to find among all potential candidate observables those that actually are invariant under gauge transformations, i.e. under isomorphisms of principal bundles with connection in the configuration space of the gauge theory.
Global gauge group
The concept of gauge groups is most prominent in quantum field theory, where the gauge group of a physical system is the group of transformations of the mathematical model of the system that do not correspond to any measurable physical effects. In this sense, nontrivial gauge groups arise from redundancies of the mathematical description. Gauge groups are a central ingredient of gauge theories.
In AQFT gauge groups are introduced via a net of C-star-systems.
Local gauge groups
In Yang-Mills theory and other gauge theories the gauge groups is the structure group GG of the GG-principal bundle on which the Yang-Mills field is a connection.
Local gauge groups are visible in the Lagrangian approach to quantum field theory, where they act on the configuration space on which the action functional is a function by gauge transformations. A large machinery has been developed to handle the (path integral) quantization of action functionals on such configuration spaces. See for instance BV-BRST formalism.
We list examples of local gauge groups and ∞-groups for various higher gauge theories.


the gauge group of GG-Yang-Mills theory is the given Lie group GG; for the Yang-Mills theory appearing in the standard model of particle physics this is the unitary group U(3)×SU(2)×U(1)U(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1);


the local gauge group of gravity on a manifold XX is the Poincare group;


the gauge 2-group of the Kalb-Ramond field is the circle 2-group BU(1)=(U(1)→1)\mathbf{B} U(1) = (U(1) \to 1);


the gauge 3-group of the supergravity C-field is the circle 3-group B 2U(1)=(U(1)→1→1)\mathbf{B}^2 U(1) = (U(1) \to 1 \to 1);


the gauge group of abelian higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory in dimension 4k+34 k+3 is the circle (2k+1)-group B 2kU(1)\mathbf{B}^{2k} U(1);


the 7-dimensional “fivebrane Chern-Simons theory” has as gauge 2-group the string 2-group;


the symmetry group of string field theory is some ∞-group that is not an nn-group for any finite nn;


an ∞-Chern-Simons theory has in general not only a gauge ∞-group but an ∞-groupoid of symmetries:


the Poisson sigma-model has as gauge groupoid the symplectic groupoid that is the Lie integration of the given Poisson Lie algebroid;


the Courant sigma-model has as gauge 2-groupoid the symplectic 2-groupoid that integrates the given Courant Lie 2-algebroid;


generally, the AKSZ sigma-model in grade nn has as gauge ∞\infty-groupoid a symplectic Lie n-groupoid.




The field of quantum field theory started out as a description of the fundamental particles that are observed in experiment, such as electrons and photons.
However, even so, abstractly the formalization of the concept of particle within QFTs is somewhat subtle.
If the quantum field theory is on Minkowski space and comes with a Hilbert space of states on which thus the Poincare group of translations, rotations and boosts in Minkowski space acts, the massive particle excitations of the theory can be found in the discrete spectrum of the time translation operator as the irreducible unitary representations of the Poincare group. For QFTs on curved spacetimes the situation is more subtle.
Often, however, QFTs are considered as quantizations of given Lagrangians. In these cases one often identifies their particle content with that explicitly encoded by the Lagrangian. Notably when that arises from second quantization of some 1-dimensional sigma-model, the particles of the theory are those described by these sigma-models.
In particle physics
In particle physics phenomenology a model is the specification of a physical theory, fundamentally of a quantum field theory, that reproduces aspects phenomenology, notably the fundamental physics observed in particle accelerators?.
The standard model of particle physics is, by default, the currently best model available, given the available experimental data.
Despite the success of this model, it is conceptually unsatisfactory in many ways and it is clear that it can be a roughly accurate description of reality not high above the currently experimentally available energy-scales. Therefore phenomenologists still “build” plenty of other models that refine the standard model in one way or other, being compatible with the present data, but making various other predictions for what should be observed at higher energies.
It is generally understood that models are approximations to reality. The proverbial saying goes:

Every model is wrong. But some models are useful.

Explicitly
A section of a morphism f:A→Bf : A \to B in some category is a right-inverse: a morphism σ:B→A\sigma : B \to A such that
f∘σ:B→σA→fB
  f \circ \sigma : B \stackrel{\sigma}{\to} A \stackrel{f}{\to} B


equals the identity morphism on BB.
Typically A→fBA \stackrel{f}{\to} B is thought of as a bundle and then one speaks of sections of bundles. For topological bundles one considers continuous sections, for smooth bundles smooth sections, etc.
In terms of dependent product
In a locally cartesian closed category 𝒞\mathcal{C}, regard the morphism f:A→Bf\colon A \to B as an object [f]∈𝒞 /B[f] \in \mathcal{C}_{/B} in the slice category over BB. Then there is the dependent product
∏B[f]∈𝒞.
  \underset{B}{\prod} [f] \in \mathcal{C}
  \,.


This is the space of sections of ff. A single section σ\sigma is a global element in here
σ:*→∏B[f].
  \sigma \colon \ast \to \underset{B}{\prod} [f]
  \,.


See at dependent product – In terms of spaces of sections for more on this.
Traditional
Given a right principal GG-bundle π:P→X\pi: P\to X and a left GG-action on some FF, all in a sufficiently strong category CC (such as Top), one can form the quotient object P× GF=(P×F)/∼P \times_G F = (P\times F)/{\sim}, where P×FP \times F is a product and ∼\sim is the smallest congruence such that (using generalized elements) (pg,f)∼(p,gf)(p g,f)\sim (p,g f); there is a canonical projection P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X where the class of (p,f)(p,f) is mapped to π(p)∈X\pi(p)\in X, hence making P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X into a fibre bundle with typical fiber FF, and the transition functions belonging to the action of GG on FF. We say that P× GF→XP\times_G F\to X is the associated bundle to P→XP\to X with fiber FF.
In geometric homotopy theory
In the context of higher topos theory there is an elegant and powerful definition and construction of associated bundles. We discuss here some basics and how this recovers the traditional definition. For more see at associated infinity-bundle and at geometry of physics – representations and associated bundles.
At geometry of physics – principal bundles in the section Smooth principal bundles via smooth groupoids is discussed how smooth principal bundles for a Lie group GG over a smooth manifold XX are equivalently the homotopy fibers of morphisms of smooth groupoids (smooth stacks) of the form
X⟶BG.
  X \stackrel{}{\longrightarrow} \mathbf{B}G
  \,.


Now given an action ρ\rho of GG on some smooth manifold VV, and regarding this action via its action groupoid projection p ρ:V//G→BGp_\rho \colon V//G \to \mathbf{B}G as discussed above, then we may consider these two morphisms into BG\mathbf{B}G jointly
  V//G   ↓ p ρ X ⟶g BG
  \array{
    && V//G
    \\
    && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_\rho}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}G
  }


and so it is natural to construct their homotopy fiber product.
We now discuss that this is equivalently the associated bundle which is associated to the principal bundle P→XP \to X via the action ρ\rho.

Proposition
For GG a smooth group (e.g. a Lie group), XX a smooth manifold, P→XP \to X a smooth GG-principal bundle over XX and ρ\rho a smooth action of GG on some smooth manifold VV, then the associated VV-fiber bundle P× GV→XP \times_G V\to X is equivalently (regarded as a smooth groupoid) the homotopy pullback of the action groupoid-projection p ρ:V//G→BGp_\rho \colon V//G \to \mathbf{B}G along a morphism g:X→BGg \colon X\to\mathbf{B}G which modulates PP
P× GV ⟶ V//G ↓  ↓ p ρ X ⟶g BG.
  \array{
    P\times_G V &\longrightarrow& V//G
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{p_\rho}}
    \\
    X &\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}& \mathbf{B}G
  }
  \,.



Proof
By the discussion at geometry of physics – principal bundles in the section Smooth principal bundles via smooth groupoids, the morphism gg of smooth groupoids is presented by a morphism of pre-smooth groupoids after choosing an open cover {U i→X}\{U_i \to X\} over wich PP trivialize and choosing a trivialization, by the zig-zag
C({U i}) • ⟶g • (BG) • ↓ ≃ lwe X
  \array{
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet &\stackrel{g_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}& (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{lwe}}}
    \\
    X
  }


where the top morphism is the Cech cocycle of the given local trivialization regarded as a morphism out of the Cech groupoid of the given cover.
Moreover, by this proposition the morphism (p ρ) •(p_\rho)_\bullet is a global fibration of pre-smooth groupoids, hence, by the discussion at geometry of physics – smooth homotopy types, the homotopy pullback in question is equivalently computed as the ordinary pullback of pre-smooth groupoids of (p ρ) •(p_\rho)_\bullet along this g •g_\bullet
C({U i}) •×(BG) •(V//G) • ⟶ (V//G) • ↓  ↓ (p ρ) • C({U i}) • ⟶g • (BG) • ↓ ≃ lwe X.
  \array{
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet \underset{(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet}{\times} (V//G)_\bullet &\longrightarrow& (V//G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow && \downarrow^{\mathrlap{(p_\rho)_\bullet}}
    \\
    C(\{U_i\})_\bullet &\stackrel{g_\bullet}{\longrightarrow}&
    (\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq_{lwe}}}
    \\
    X
  }
  \,.


This pullback is computed componentwise. Hence it is the pre-smooth groupoid whose morphisms are pairs consisting of a morphism (x,i)→(x,j)(x,i)\to (x,j) in the Cech groupoid as well as a morphism s→gρ(s)(g)s \stackrel{g}{\to} \rho(s)(g) in the action groupoid, such that the group label gg of the latter equals the cocycle g ij(x)g_{i j}(x) of the cocycle on the former. Schematically:
C({U i}) •×(BG) •(V//G) •={((x,i),s)⟶g ij(x)((x,j),ρ(s)(g))}.
  C(\{U_i\})_\bullet \underset{(\mathbf{B}G)_\bullet}{\times} (V//G)_\bullet
  =
  \left\{
     ((x,i),s) \stackrel{g_{i j}(x)}{\longrightarrow} ((x,j),\rho(s)(g))
  \right\}
  \,.


This means that the pullback groupoid has at most one morphism between every ordered pair of objects. Accordingly this groupoid is equivalence of groupoids equivalent to the quotient of its space of objects by the equivalence relation induced by its morphisms:
⋯≃(∐iU i×V)/ ∼.
  \cdots \simeq
  \left(
    \underset{i}{\coprod} U_i \times V
  \right)/_\sim
  \,.


This is a traditional description of the associated bundle in question.

In particle physics, matter is a bound state of fermionic particles.
This is in contrast to force fields, whose quanta are bosonic particles.
In the standard model of particle physics, all matter fields are sections of a spinor bundle on spacetime which is associated of a U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)-principal bundle.
In the standard model of cosmology matter is characterized as part of the energy-momentum density with specific parameter of state w=p/ρw = p/\rho, see at FRW model.
In particle physics
In particle physics phenomenology a model is the specification of a physical theory, fundamentally of a quantum field theory, that reproduces aspects phenomenology, notably the fundamental physics observed in particle accelerators?.
The standard model of particle physics is, by default, the currently best model available, given the available experimental data.

Therefore phenomenologists still “build” plenty of other models that refine the standard model in one way or other, being compatible with the present data, but making various other predictions for what should be observed at higher energies.
It is generally understood that models are approximations to reality. The proverbial saying goes:

Every model is wrong. But some models are useful.

In the context of mechanics (broadly construed), one distinguishes between kinematics and dynamics:


Kinematics concerns (only) the physical fields, states and observables, including the spaces and algebras (such as a phase space or Hilbert space of (pure) states and an appropriate algebra of observables) into which they are organised;


Dynamics additionally treats the evolution of the system in time or even spacetime: as given by a Lagrangian and action functional and as given by the action of Hamiltonian quantum observables on physical states.
In the Schrödinger picture, we think of the states as evolving, while the observables evolve in the Heisenberg picture. In the interaction picture we think of the states as evolving with respect to a given time evolution and the observables to evolve, too, with respect to a perturbation of this time evolution.

Given a Lagrangian field theory with field bundle E→fbΣE \overset{fb}{\to} \Sigma over spacetime Σ\Sigma, then a field history is a smooth section of this field bundle Φ∈Γ Σ(E)\Phi \in \Gamma_\Sigma(E).
For every Cauchy surface Σ p↪Σ\Sigma_p \hookrightarrow \Sigma the restriction Φ| Σ p\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p} of Φ\Phi to Σ p\Sigma_p may be thought of as the field configuration “at that time” and hence the change of Φ| Σ p\Phi\vert_{\Sigma_p} as the choice of Cauchy surface changes reflects the “history” of these configurations, whence the name.
For a sigma model field theory a field history may be thought of as a trajectory.

General
A spacetime is a manifold that models space and time in physics.
This is formalized by saying that a spacetime is a smooth Lorentzian space (X,μ)(X,\mu) equipped with a time orientation (see there).
Hence a point in a spacetime is called an event.
In the context of classical general relativity a spacetime is usually in addition assumed to be connected and four-dimensional. A connected Lorentzian manifold is either time orientable or it has a two-sheeted covering which is time orientable.
In classical physics, notably in special relativity and general relativity points in XX model coordinates where events can take place from the viewpoint of an observer (“points in space and time”) while the metric μ\mu models the field of gravity in general relativity.
Intermingling of space and time
The noun “spacetime” is used in both special relativity and general relativity, but is best motivated from the viewpoint of general relativity. Special relativity deals with the Minkowski spacetime only. The Minkowski spacetime allows a canonical choice of global coordinates such that the metric tensor has in every point the form diag(-1, 1, 1, 1), which identifies the first coordinate as representing the time coordinate and the others as representing space coordinates.
Given a general spacetime, there is not necessarily a globally defined coordinate system, and therefore not necessarily a globally defined canonical time coordinate. More specifically, there are spacetimes that admit coordinates defined on subsets where the physical interpretation of the coordinates as modelling time and space coordinates changes over the domain of definition.
(TODO: references and explanations).
The covariant phase space of a system in physics is the space of all of its solutions to its classical equations of motion, the space of trajectories of the system. Often one considers a parameterization of this by boundary data or choice of a Cauchy surface. This parameterization is what traditionally is just called a “phase space”. The “covariant” in “covariant phase space” is to indicated that it comes without any unnatural choices.
For a system described by Lagrangian mechanics, the covariant phase space comes canonically equipped with a presymplectic structure. A proper phase space or reduced phase space is a quotient space of the covariant phase space on which the presymplectic structure refines to a symplectic structure or Poisson strucure.
Typically these phase spaces are (locally) naturally parameterized by the suitable boundary conditions which uniquely determine the corresponding history of the physical system. Much of the literature on phase spaces deals with parameterizing these boundary conditions.
For instance for a non-relativistic particle propagating on a Riemannian manifold XX with the usual action functional, a trajectory is uniquely fixed by the position x∈Xx \in X and the momentum p∈T x *Xp \in T^*_x X of the particle at a given time. Correspondingly the space of all solutions and hence the (covariant) phase space of the system may be identified with the cotangent bundle T *XT^* X of XX.
(The term “phase” in “phase space” can be related to the phase of complex numbers in this example, see at phase and phase space in physics.)
However, even reduced phase spaces are not all cotangent bundles, typically not, for instance, if they are obtained by symplectic reduction. This way a finite-dimensional phase space can sometimes describe continuous systems (e.g. in hydrodynamics) whch have infinitely many degrees of freedom; that phase space is however not a cotangent bundle of something in general.
In formal logic, a metalanguage is a language (formal or informal) in which the symbols and rules for manipulating another (formal) language – the object language – are themselves formulated. That is, the metalanguage is the language used when talking about the object language.
For instance the symbol ϕ\phi may denote a proposition in a deductive system, but the statement “ϕ\phi can be proven” is not itself a proposition in the deductive system, but a statement in the metalanguage, often denoted by a sequent of the form
⊢ϕtrue
  \vdash \phi \, true


and then called a judgement instead (in type theory one might also omit the “truetrue”, see at propositions-as-types for details on this). Or, more generally, if the truth of ϕ\phi depends on the truth of some other proposition ψ\psi then
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true


is the hypothetical judgement in the metalanguage that there is a proof of ϕ\phi in the context in which ψ\psi is assumed.
In contrast, the implication expression (ψ→ϕ)(\psi \to \phi) may denote another proposition in the object language, a conditional statement. A deduction theorem connects the two, in that it says that if the judgement
ψtrue⊢ϕtrue
  \psi \, true \vdash \phi \, true  



holds in the metalanguage, then the judgement
⊢(ψ→ϕ)true
  \vdash (\psi \to \phi) \, true


may be deduced; the converse is the rule of modus ponens. (Actually, both the deduction theorem and modus ponens are slightly more general, being relativized to an arbitrary context, but we needn't get into that here.)

In many categories CC in which one does homotopy theory, there is a notion of homotopy between morphisms, which is closely related to the 2-morphisms in higher category theory: a homotopy between two morphisms is a way in which they are equivalent.
If we regard such a category as a presentation of an (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category, then homotopies f∼gf\sim g present the 2-cells f⇒gf\Rightarrow g in the resulting (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category.
In topological spaces

Definition
For f,g:X⟶Yf,g\colon X \longrightarrow Y two continuous functions between topological spaces X,YX,Y, then a left homotopy
η:f⇒ Lg
  \eta \colon f \,\Rightarrow_L\, g


is a continuous function
η:X×I⟶Y
  \eta \;\colon\; X \times I \longrightarrow Y


out of the standard cylinder object over XX: the product space of XX with the Euclidean closed interval I≔[0,1]I \coloneqq [0,1], such that this fits into a commuting diagram of the form


X  (id,δ 0)↓ ↘ f X×I ⟶η Y  (id,δ 1)↑ ↗ g X.

  \,.


(graphics grabbed from J. Tauber here)


Example
Let XX be a topological space and let x,y∈Xx,y \in X be two of its points, regarded as functions x,y:*⟶Xx,y \colon \ast \longrightarrow X from the point to XX. Then a left homotopy, def. , between these two functions is a commuting diagram of the form
*  δ 0↓ ↘ x I ⟶η X  δ 1↑ ↗ y *.
  \array{
     \ast
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_0}}\downarrow & \searrow^{\mathrlap{x}}

     I &\stackrel{\eta}{\longrightarrow}& X
     \\
     {}^{\mathllap{\delta_1}}\uparrow & \nearrow_{\mathrlap{y}}
     \\
     \ast
  }
  \,.


This is simply a continuous path in XX whose endpoints are xx and yy.

In enriched categories
If CC is enriched over Top, then a homotopy in CC between maps f,g:X⇉Yf,g:X\,\rightrightarrows \,Y is a map H:[0,1]→C(X,Y)H:[0,1] \to C(X,Y) in TopTop such that H(0)=fH(0)=f and H(1)=gH(1)=g. In TopTop itself this is the classical notion.
If CC has copowers, then an equivalent definition is a map [0,1]⊙X→Y[0,1]\odot X\to Y, while if it has powers, an equivalent definition is a map X→⋔([0,1],Y)X\to \pitchfork([0,1],Y).
There is a similar definition in a simplicially enriched category, replacing [0,1][0,1] with the 1-simplex Δ 1\Delta^1, with the caveat that in this case not all simplicial homotopies need be composable even if they match correctly. (This depends on whether or not all (2,1)-horns in the simplicial set, C(X,Y)C(X,Y), have fillers.) Likewise in a dg-category we can use the “chain complex interval” to get a notion of chain homotopy.
In model categories
If 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a model category, it has an intrinsic notion of homotopy determined by its factorizations. For more on the following see at homotopy in a model category.

Definition
Let 𝒞\mathcal{C} be a model category and X∈𝒞X \in \mathcal{C} an object.

A path object Path(X)Path(X) for XX is a factorization of the diagonal ∇ X:X→X×X\nabla_X \colon X \to X \times X as

∇ X:X⟶∈WiPath(X)⟶(p 0,p 1)X×X.
  \nabla_X 
  \;\colon\;
   X \underoverset{\in W}{i}{\longrightarrow} Path(X) \overset{(p_0,p_1)}{\longrightarrow} X \times X
  \,.


where X→Path(X)X\to Path(X) is a weak equivalence. This is called a good path object if in addition Path(X)→X×XPath(X) \to X \times X is a fibration.

A cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) for XX is a factorization of the codiagonal (or “fold map”) Δ X:X⊔X→X\Delta_X: X \sqcup X \to X as

Δ X:X⊔X⟶(i 0,i 1)Cyl(X)⟶p∈WX.
  \Delta_X
  \;\colon\;
  X \sqcup X \overset{(i_0,i_1)}{\longrightarrow} Cyl(X) \underoverset{p}{\in W}{\longrightarrow} X
  \,.


where Cyl(X)→XCyl(X) \to X is a weak equivalence. This is called a good cylinder object if in addition X⊔X→Cyl(X)X \sqcup X \to Cyl(X) is a cofibration.


Remark
By the factorization axioms every object in a model category has both a good path object and as well as a good cylinder object according to def. . But in some situations one is genuinely interested in using non-good such objects.
For instance in the classical model structure on topological spaces, the obvious object X×[0,1]X\times [0,1] is a cylinder object, but not a good cylinder unless XX itself is cofibrant (a cell complex in this case).
More generally, the path object Path(X)Path(X) of def.  is analogous to the powering ⋔(I,X)\pitchfork(I,X) with an interval object and the cylinder object Cyl(X)Cyl(X) is analogous to the tensoring I⊙XI\odot X with an interval object. In fact, if 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a VV-enriched model category and XX is fibrant/cofibrant, then these powers and copowers are in fact examples of (good) path and cylinder objects if the interval object is sufficiently good.


Definition
Let f,g:X⟶Yf,g \colon X \longrightarrow Y be two parallel morphisms in a model category.

A left homotopy η:f⇒ Lg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_L g is a morphism η:Cyl(X)⟶Y\eta \colon Cyl(X) \longrightarrow Y from a cylinder object of XX, def. , such that it makes this diagram commute:

X ⟶ Cyl(X) ⟵ X   f↘ ↓ η ↙ g   Y.
  \array{
    X &\longrightarrow& Cyl(X) &\longleftarrow& X
    \\
    & {}_{\mathllap{f}}\searrow &\downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}}& \swarrow_{\mathrlap{g}}
    \\
    && 
    Y
  }
  \,.



A right homotopy η:f⇒ Rg\eta \colon f \Rightarrow_R g is a morphism η:X→Path(Y)\eta \colon X \to Path(Y) to some path object of XX, def. , such that this diagram commutes:

  X   f↙ ↓ η ↘ g Y ⟵ Path(Y) ⟶ Y.
  \array{
    && X
    \\
    & {}^{\mathllap{f}}\swarrow & \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\eta}} & \searrow^{\mathrlap{g}} 
    \\
    Y &\longleftarrow& Path(Y) &\longrightarrow& Y
  }
  \,.



Remark
By remark  it follows that in a TopTop-enriched model category, any enriched homotopy between maps X→YX\to Y is a left homotopy if XX is cofibrant and a right homotopy if YY is fibrant. Similar remarks hold for other enrichments.

For more see at homotopy in a model category.
In (co-)fibration categories
Clearly the concept of left homotopy in def.  only needs part of the model category axioms and thus makes sense more generally in suitable cofibration categories. Dually, the concept of path objects in def.  makes sense more generally in suitable fibration categories such as categories of fibrant objects in the sense of Brown.
Likewise if there is a cylinder functor, one gets functorially defined cylinder objects, etc.
In dependent type theory
In dependent type theory, let AA be a type and let PP be a type family indexed by AA, and let f,g:∏ x:AP(x)f,g:\prod_{x:A} P(x) be two elements of a dependent product type of a type family PP. The type of homotopies between ff and gg is the type
f∼g≡∏ x:A(f(x)= B(x)g(x))f \sim g \equiv \prod_{x:A} (f(x) =_{B(x)} g(x))
A homotopy between ff and gg is simply an element H:f∼gH:f \sim g.
Note that a homotopy is not the same as an identification f=gf = g. However this can be made so if one assumes function extensionality.
For XX a smooth space, there are useful refinements of the fundamental groupoid Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X) which remember more than just the homotopy class of paths, i.e. whose morphisms are (piecewise, say) smooth paths in XX modulo an equivalence relation still strong enough to induce a groupoid structure, but weaker than dividing out homotopies relative to endpoints.
Let XX be a smooth manifold.

Definition
For γ 1,γ 2:[0,1]→X\gamma_1, \gamma_2  : [0,1] \to X two smooth maps, a thin homotopy γ 1⇒γ 2\gamma_1 \Rightarrow \gamma_2 is a smooth homotopy, i.e. a smooth map
Σ:[0,1] 2→X
  \Sigma : [0,1]^2 \to X


with

Σ(0,−)=γ 1\Sigma(0,-) = \gamma_1
Σ(1,−)=γ 2\Sigma(1,-) = \gamma_2
Σ(−,0)=γ 1(0)=γ 2(0)\Sigma(-,0) = \gamma_1(0) = \gamma_2(0)
Σ(−,1)=γ 1(1)=γ 2(1)\Sigma(-,1) = \gamma_1(1) = \gamma_2(1)

which is thin in that it doesn’t sweep out any surface: every 22-form pulled back to it vanishes:

∀B∈Ω 2(X):Σ *B=0\forall B \in \Omega^2(X)\colon \Sigma^* B = 0.



Definition
A path γ:[0,1]→X\gamma\colon [0,1] \to X has sitting instants if there is a neighbourhood of the boundary of [0,1][0,1] such that γ\gamma is locally constant restricted to that.


Definition
The path groupoid P 1(X)P_1(X) is the diffeological groupoid that has

Obj(P 1(X))=XObj(P_1(X)) = X
P 1(X)(x,y)={P_1(X)(x,y) = \{thin-homotopy classes of paths γ:x→y\gamma\colon x \to y  with sitting instants}\}.

Composition of paths comes from concatenation and reparameterization of representatives. The quotient by thin-homotopy ensures that this yields an associative composition with inverses for each path.

This definition makes sense for XX any generalized smooth space, in particular for XX a sheaf on Diff.
Moreover, P 1(X)P_1(X) is always itself naturally a groupoid internal to generalized smooth spaces: if XX is a Chen space or diffeological space then P 1(X)P_1(X) is itself internal to that category. However, even if XX is a manifold, P 1(X)P_1(X) will not be a manifold, see smooth structure of the path groupoid for details.
There are various generalizations of the path groupoid to n-groupoids and ∞-groupoids. See


path n-groupoid,


path ∞-groupoid.


A discrete space is, in general, an object of a concrete category SpSp of spaces that is free on its own underlying set. More generally, the notion can be applied relative to any forgetful functor.
Note: This page is about the “cohesive” or “topological” notion of discreteness. In 2-category theory the term “discrete object” is also often used for 0-truncated objects. For this usage, see discrete morphism instead.
A discrete space must, in particular, be a free object for the forgetful functor U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp\to Set, i.e. in the image of its left adjoint F:Set→SpF: Set \to Sp. However, this is not sufficient for it to be free on its own underlying set; we must also require that the counit FUX→XF U X\to X be an isomorphism.
Thus, we say that U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp \to Set (or more generally, any functor) has discrete spaces or discrete objects if it has a fully faithful left adjoint. This ensures that the functor
Set→FSp→USet Set \stackrel{F}\to Sp \stackrel{U}\to Set 
is (naturally isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set. This is true, for example, if SpSp is Top, Diff, Loc, etc.
Assuming that UU is faithful (as it is when SpSp is a concrete category), we can characterise a discrete space XX as one such that every function from XX to YY (for YY any space) is a morphism of spaces. (More precisely, this means that every function from U(X)U(X) to U(Y)U(Y) is the image under UU of a morphism from XX to YY.)
The dual notion is a codiscrete object.
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
An object in the essential image of coDisccoDisc is called a codiscrete object.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc)ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
If one thinks of ℰ\mathcal{E} as a category of spaces, then the codiscrete objects are called codiscrete spaces.
The dual notion is that of discrete objects.


Proposition
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.



Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has a terminal object that is preserved by Γ\Gamma, then ℰ\mathcal{E} has concrete objects.

This is (Shulman, theorem 1).

Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has codiscrete objects and has pullbacks that are preserved by Γ\Gamma and , then Γ\Gamma is a Grothendieck fibration.

This is (Shulman, theorem 2).
An axiom is a proposition in logic that a given theory requires to be true: every model of the theory is required to make the axiom hold true. The sense however is that an axiom is a basic true proposition, used to prove other true propositions (the theorems) in the theory.
Given a language LL (perhaps specified by a signature: a collection of types, function symbols and relation symbols), a theory is the collection of assertions which are derivable (using the rules of deduction of the ambient logic or deductive system) from a given set of assertions, called axioms of the theory. In other words, a theory is generated from a set of axioms, by starting with those axioms and applying rules of deduction, much as terms in an algebraic system may be generated from a set of basic terms by applying operations. Axioms should therefore be considered as presenting a theory; different axiom sets may well give the same theory.
In terms of a deductive system, axioms can be regarded as “rules with zero hypotheses”. The form of such axioms depends on the details of the deductive system used: it could be natural deduction, sequent calculus, a Hilbert system, etc. If we take sequent calculus, for instance, then any collection of sequents written in the given language LL
ϕ→⊢ x→ψ→
  \vec{\phi} \vdash_{\vec x} \vec{\psi}


(asserting that “If every proposition ϕ i\phi_i is true in context x→\vec{x} then also some ψ i\psi_i is/has to be true”) can be taken as a collection of axioms for some theory. Models of the theory will then be those structures of the language in which the axioms are interpreted as true statements. For example, a model of group theory is a structure in the language of groups for which the group theory axioms hold, which is (of course) a group.
Assuming the deductive system is sound?, every sequent which is the conclusion of a valid sequent deduction, starting from the axioms, will also be true in every model. And if the deductive system is also complete, then every sequent of the language which is true in every model will in fact be provable from the axioms.

Definition
An adjoint triple (of functors between categories or generally of 1-morphisms in a 2-category)
(F⊣G⊣H):C→D
  (F \dashv G \dashv H) \colon C \to D 


is a triple of functors/morphisms F,H:C→DF,H \colon C \to D and G:D→CG \colon D \to C together with adjunction data F⊣GF\dashv G and G⊣HG\dashv H. That is, it is an adjoint string of length 3.


Proposition
An adjoint triple (F⊣G⊣H)(F\dashv G\dashv H), def.  is equivalently an adjoint pair in the 2-category whose morphisms are adjoint pairs in the original 2-category, hence an adjunction of adjunctions
(F⊣G)⊣(G⊣H).
  (F \dashv G) \dashv (G \dashv H)
  \,.


This fact plays an important role in Licata–Shulman, 5.1. Relatedly, it also appears in the characterization of certain kinds of geometric morphism (e.g. the local ones) in terms of adjunctions in the 2-category Topos.
It may be suggestive to denote this like so
F ⊣ G ⊥  ⊥ G ⊣ H
  \array{
     F &\dashv& G
     \\
     \bot && \bot
     \\
     G &\dashv& H
  }


such that the two adjoint pairs appear horizontally, while the second order adjunction between them runs vertically.
The term modal logic refers to an enrichment of standard formal logic, where the standard logical conjunctions (and, or, not, implication and, perhaps, for all, exists etc.) are accompanied by certain extra operations – called modal operators and traditionally denoted by symbols like “□\Box”, “◊\lozenge”, , “◯\bigcirc” – such that for pp any proposition an expression like □p\Box p is a(nother) proposition whose interpretation is intended to be:

“pp holds (only) in a certain way”,

where the “certain way” is (implicitly) specified by whatever axioms are satisfied by the given modal operator.
In other words, modal operators in modal logic are meant to express a certain mode of being true — and in generalization to modal type theory they express more generally a mode of being, whence the reference to Kant‘s modalities.
For example (see also pointers below):


in epistemic logic one considers modal operators meant to express that
“pp is necessarily true”, or that “pp is possibly true”
(often read as “necessarily known to be true” etc., whence the reference to epistemology);


in temporal logic one considers modal operators meant to express that
“pp will eventually become true”, etc.;


in doxastic logic one is concerned with statements such as:
“pp is believed to be true”, etc.


Beware however that there is no broad agreement on which further axioms exactly make a general modal operator — which in itself is any (co-)monad on the underlying universe of propositions (of types), see below — encode/reflect any such intended “mode of being (true)”. As a result:

‘Ask three modal logicians what modal logic is, and you are likely to get at least three different answers’. [Blackburn, deRijke & Venema (2001), Introduction]

Historically, the default example of a modal logic is known as S4 modal logic, originally motivated as a model for epistemic logic (with a modality for being “necessarily true”), but really just axiomatizing (propositional logic equipped with) any co-monad □\Box on the universe of propositions, without further specification. There are variants known as T modal logic and K modal logic which drop some of the axioms even on this comonad, but it seems good practice to agree that a modal operator is at least a (co-)monad on the universe of propositions (of types).
In this sense, modal logic is the counterpart in the computational trilogy to:


category theory with (co-)monads (categorical algebra),


computer science with (co-)monads in computer science (computational effects).


A traditional semantics considered for modal logics is in terms of sets with relations, called Kripke frames. Specifically for epistemic logic this is also known as possible worlds semantics. However, the canonical categorical semantics for epistemic logic is arguably in categorical models of dependent types, as explained here.
There is also algebraic semantics in terms of algebras with (co)-closure operators. For instance, temporal logics can have posets as models.
Here is a brief list of flavors of modal logic. More details are discussed below.


epistemic logics: it is known to XX that, it is common knowledge that;


temporal logic: henceforth, eventually, hitherto, previously, now, tomorrow, yesterday, since, until, inevitably, finally, ultimately, endlessly, it will have been, it is being …


dynamic logic?: after the program/computation/action finishes, the program enables, throughout the computation;


doxastic logic: it is believed that


deontic logic: it is obligatory/forbidden/permitted/unlawful that


geometric logic: it is locally the case that


metalogic: it is valid/satisfiable/provable/consistent that (Goldblatt).
The metalogical version was important in the history of modern modal logic. Gödel played an important role there.

Löb's axiom (incompleteness theorem)



A monad is a structure that is a lot like a monoid, but that lives in a bicategory rather than a monoidal category. In other words, the concept of a monad is a vertical categorification of that of a monoid.
Monads are among the most pervasive structures in category theory and its applications (notably to categorical algebra). For their applications to computer science, see monads in computer science.
Many of these applications use monads in the bicategory Cat, which is called a monad on a category. These are central to the category-theoretic account of universal algebra, as well as underlying the theory of simplicial objects and thus, via the Dold-Kan correspondence, much of homological algebra.
Monads
A monad in a bicategory KK is given by


an object aa, together with


an endomorphism t:a→at \colon a \to a, and


2-cellsη:1 a→t\;\eta \colon 1_a \to t (the unit of tt) and μ:t∘t→t\mu \colon t \circ t \to t (the multiplication)


such that the diagrams 

















































































 



























































 commute (where certain coherence isomorphisms have been omitted).
The name “monad” and the terms “unit”, “multiplication” and “associativity” bear a clear analogy with monoids (but see also at monad (disambiguation)). Indeed, one can define a monad on an object aa of a bicategory KK as just a monoid object in the endomorphism category K(a,a)K(a,a). Alternatively, monads can be taken as more fundamental, and a monoid in a monoidal category CC can be defined as a monad in BC\mathbf{B} C, the one-object bicategory corresponding to CC.
A third and somewhat less obvious definition says that a monad in KK is a lax 2-functor from the terminal bicategory 11 to KK: the unique object *\ast of 11 is sent to the object aa, the morphism 1 a1_a becomes tt, and η\eta and μ\mu arise from the coherent 2-cells expressing lax functoriality. This in turn is equivalent to saying that a monad is a category enriched in a bicategory with a single object and single morphism. Among higher-category theorists, it’s tempting to suggest that this is the most fundamental definition, and the most basic reason for the ubiquity and importance of monads. Regardless of this, however, the earlier more elementary definitions are both practically and pedagogically essential.
Finally, a monad can be defined in terms of the “Kleisli operation” taking any map a→Tba \to T b to a map Ta→TbT a \to T b; see extension system.
We can picture a monad in KK as an image of the third oriental in KK. See the remarks at monoidal category.
The data of and axioms for a monad can be expressed graphically as string diagrams. Writing T:C→C,η,μT \colon C \to C, \eta, \mu for the monad in question (this notation being the standard one when K=CatK = Cat), these data can be represented as

Thanks to the distinctive shapes, one can usually omit the labels:

The axioms then appear as:

Monads in CatCat are sometimes, mostly in older literature, also called triples (alluding to the triple of data (A,μ,i)(A,\mu,i)), following Eilenberg and Moore, or triads. In even older literature, they are also referred to as standard constructions, the original term used by Godement when he introduced the idea, or fundamental constructions. For terminological remarks by Ross Street see category-list here.
The bicategory of monads
Given the equivalence between monads in KK and lax functors 1→K1 \to K it is straightforward to define the bicategory Mnd(K)Mnd(K) of monads in KK to be the lax functor category [1,K] ℓ[1,K]_\ell, which consists of lax functors, lax transformations and modifications.
Spelling this out, we see that an object of Mnd(K)Mnd(K) is a monad (a,t,η,μ)(a,t,\eta,\mu) in KK. A morphism of monads (a,t)→(b,s)(a,t) \to (b,s) is given by 1-cell x:a→bx \colon a \to b together with a 2-cell λ:sx→xt\lambda \colon s x \to x t satisfying
x →η sx sx xη t↓  ↓λ xt →1 xtssx →sλ sxt →λt xtt μ sx↓    ↓xμ t sx  →λ  xt
\array{
  x & \stackrel{\eta^s x}{\to} & s x \\
  \mathllap{x \eta^t} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\lambda} \\
  x t & \stackrel{1}{\to} & x t
}\qquad \qquad
\array{
 s s x & \stackrel{s \lambda}{\to} & s x t & \stackrel{\lambda t}{\to}
 & x t t \\
 \mathllap{\mu^s x} \downarrow & & & & \downarrow \mathrlap{x \mu^t}
 \\
 s x & & \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} & & x t
}


Finally, a 2-cell (x,λ)⇒(y,κ)(x,\lambda) \Rightarrow (y, \kappa) is given by a 2-cell m:x⇒ym \colon x \Rightarrow y satisfying
sx →sm sy λ↓  ↓κ xt →mt yt
\array{
 s x & \stackrel{s m}{\to} & s y \\
 \mathllap{\lambda} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\kappa} \\
 x t & \stackrel{m t}{\to} & y t
}


Algebras/modules over a monad
Given that a monad in a bicategory ℬ\mathcal{B} is nothing but a monoid object in a hom-category ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a), it is natural to consider a module over this monoid: a module for a monad. This notion of module is more general than a module in a monoidal category, however, since it need not live in ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a) but can be in ℬ(b,a)\mathcal{B}(b,a) (for left modules) or ℬ(a,c)\mathcal{B}(a,c) (for right modules).
In a Cat-like bicategory, left modules over a monad are usually known as algebras over the monad. This terminology is confusing from the point of view of monads as monoids, but is justified because in Cat itself, such algebras with domain 1 are just algebras for a monad in the classical sense. Such algebras are a powerful tool to encode general algebraic structures; this is the topic of universal algebra. The algebras over a monad form its Eilenberg-Moore category, which is characterized by a universal property.
Some monads arise from operads, in which case algebras for the monad are the same as algebras for the operad. A Lawvere theory is another special sort of monad in CatCat.
Relation to adjunctions and monadicity
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) induces a monad R∘LR \circ L and a comonad L∘RL \circ R. There is in general more than one adjunction which gives rise to a given monad this way, in fact there is a category of adjunctions for a given monad. An adjunction inducing a monad TT is called a resolution of TT. The initial object in that category is the adjunction over the Kleisli category of the monad and the terminal object is that over the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras. (e.g. Borceux, vol. 2, prop. 4.2.2) The latter is called the monadic adjunction.
Moreover, passing from adjunctions to monads and back to their monadic adjunctions constitutes itself an adjunction between adjunctions and monads, called the semantics-structure adjunction.
A comonad (or cotriple) on a category AA is a comonoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors A→AA \to A. More generally, a comonad in a 2-category EE is a comonoid in the monoidal category E(X,X)E(X,X) for some object X∈KX\in K.
Just as a monad may be defined for any 2-category, EE, as a lax 2-functor from 1\mathbf{1} to EE, so a comonad in EE is an oplax 2-functor from 1→E\mathbf{1} \to E.
See at monad for more.
Coalgebras
A coalgebra over a comonad (or comodule) over a comonad CC on a category AA is an object a∈Aa\in A with a map a→Caa\to C a satisfying dual axioms to those for an algebra over a monad. The category of coalgebras is called its (co-)Eilenberg-Moore category and satisfies a universal property dual to that of the Eilenberg-Moore object for a monad; it can thereby be internalized to any 2-category. The forgetful functor from the category of coalgebras to the category AA is called a comonadic functor. Similarly, a comonad also has a co-Kleisli category.
Comonadic homology and descent
Any comonad on AA induces an augmented simplicial endofunctor of AA consisting of its iterates. If AA is an abelian category and the comonad is additive, then this is the basis of comonadic homology?. Comodules (= coalgebras) over the comonad with underlying endofunctor M R↦M R⊗ RSM_R\mapsto M_R\otimes_R S in RR-ModMod for the extension of rings R↪SR\hookrightarrow S correspond to the descent data for that extension. Gluing of categories from localizations may also be formalized via comonads.
Mixed distributive laws
Distributive laws between a monad and a comonad are so-called mixed distributive laws; a special case has been rediscovered in physics under the name entwining structures (Brzeziński, Majid 1997). Their theory is often studied in the connection with the theory of comonads in the bicategory of rings, modules and morphisms of modules, that is corings. There is a homomorphism of bicategories from a bicategory of entwinings to a bicategory of corings (Škoda 2008), which is an analogue of the 2-functor compcomp (R. Street, Formal theory of monads, JPAA 1972) of strict 2-categories in the case of distributive laws of monads (recall also that a distributive law among monads corresponds to a monad in the 2-category of monads).
In computer science, a (co-)monad (or (co-)Kleisli triple, or (co-)extension system) is a kind of data type-structure which describes “notions of computations” [Moggi (1989), Moggi (1991)] that may “have external effects or be subject to external contexts/causes” — such as involving random access memory, input/output, exception handling, writing to or reading from global variables, etc. — as familiar from imperative programming but cast as “pure functions” with deterministic and verifiable behaviour, in the style of functional programming.
In short, a (“extension system-style” [Manes (1976), Ex. 3.12] or “Kleisli triple-style” [Moggi (1991), Def. 1.2]) monad in a given programming language consists of assignments (but see below):


to any data type DD of a new data type ℰ(D)\mathcal{E}(D) of “DD-data with ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects”,


to any pair of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful functions (programs) of the form prog 12:D 1→ℰ(D 2)prog_{12} \,\colon\, D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_2) and prog 23:D 2→ℰ(D 3)prog_{23} \,\colon\, D_2 \to \mathcal{E}(D_3) of an effective-composite function bind ℰprog 23∘prog 12(−):D 1→ℰ(D 3)bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog_{23} \;\circ\; prog_{12}(-) \,\colon\, D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_3) (their binding or Kleisli composition),


to any data type DD of a function ret D ℰ:D→ℰ(D)ret^{\mathcal{E}}_D \;\colon\; D \to \mathcal{E}(D) assigning “trivial ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects”,


such that the binding is associative and also unital with respect to the return operation, hence such that data types with ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs between them constitute a category (the Kleisli category of the given effect/monad ℰ\mathcal{E}).
We now explain in more detail what this means and what it is good for.
Basic idea: Monadic effects
In programming it frequently happens that a program with “nominal” output data type DD de facto outputs data of some modified type T(D)T(D) which accounts for “external effects” caused by the program, where
(1)D↦ℰ(D)
  
  D \;\mapsto\; \mathcal{E}(D)


is some general operation sending data types DD to new data types ℰ(D)\mathcal{E}(D).

For example, if alongside the computation of its nominal output data d:Dd \colon D a program also writes a log message msg:msg \,\colon\, String, then its actual output data is the pair (d,msg)(d, msg) of product type Write(D)≔D×StringWrite(D) \,\coloneqq\, D \times String.
Or, dually, if the program may fail and instead “throw an exception message” msg:msg \,\colon\, String, then its actual output data is either d:Dd \colon D or msg:Stringmsg \colon String, hence is of coproduct type Excep(D)≔D⊔StringExcep(D) \,\coloneqq\, D \sqcup String.

Given such an ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful program prog 12:D 1→ℰ(D 2)prog_{12} \;\colon\; D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_2) and given a subsequent program prog 23:D 2→ℰ(D 3)prog_{23} \,\colon\, D_2 \to \mathcal{E}(D_3) accepting nominal input data of type D 2D_2 and itself possibly involved in further effects of type ℰ(−)\mathcal{E}(-), then the naïve composition of the two programs makes no sense (unless ℰ(D)=D\mathcal{E}(D) = D is actually the trivial sort of effect), but their evident intended composition is, clearly, obtained by:


first adjusting prog 23prog_{23} via a given prescription
(2)prog↦bind ℰprog,
  
  \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!
  prog \;\mapsto\; bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog
  \,,


such that bind ℰprog 23:ℰ(D 2)→ℰ(D 3)bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog_{23} \,\colon\, \mathcal{E}(D_2) \to \mathcal{E}(D_3):


does accept data of type ℰ(D 2)\mathcal{E}(D_2) and


“acts as prog 23prog_{23} while carrying any previous ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects along” (this intuition becomes a formal fact below in (9));




then forming the naive composition bind ℰprog 23∘prog 12bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog_{23} \;\circ\;  prog_{12}


as follows:




(Beware that we are denoting by “bind ℰprog(−)bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog (-)” what in programming languages like Haskell is denoted by “(-) >>= prog” aka “fish notation”, eg. Milewski (2019), and which some authors denote by “prog *prog^\ast\,”, e.g. Moggi (1991); Uustalu (2021), lecture 1, p. 12.)

Depending on the intended behaviour of these programs, it remains to specify how exactly bind ℰprog 23bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog_{23} “carries ℰ(−)\mathcal{E}(-)-effects along”, hence what the “bind” operation (2) does concretely.

For instance, in the above example of a logging-effect, where Write(D 2)≔D 2×StringWrite(D_2) \,\coloneqq\, D_2 \times String, the evident way is to use the concatenation String×String→concatStringString \times String \xrightarrow{\; concat \;} String and set:
bind Writeprog 23≔D 2×String→prog 23×Id StringD 3×String×String→Id D 3×concatD 3×String. bind^{Write} prog_{23}\;\coloneqq\; D_2 \times String \xrightarrow{ prog_{23} \times Id_{String} } D_3 \times String \times String \xrightarrow{ Id_{D_3} \times concat } D_3 \times String \,. 
In the other example above, where the effect is the possible throwing of an exception message, the evident way to carry this kind of effect along is to use the codiagonal ∇:String⊔String→String\nabla \,\colon\, String \sqcup String \to String, which amounts to keep forwarding the exception that has already been thrown, if any:
bind Excepprog 23≔D 2⊔String→prog 23⊔Id StringD 3⊔String⊔String→id D 3⊔∇D 3⊔String.bind^{Excep} prog_{23} \;\coloneqq\; D_2 \sqcup String \xrightarrow{ prog_{23} \sqcup Id_{String} } D_3 \sqcup String \sqcup String \xrightarrow{ id_{D_3} \sqcup \nabla } D_3 \sqcup String \,.

Whatever design choice one makes for how to “carry along effects”, it must be consistent in that applying the method to a triple of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs which are nominally composable, then their effectful composition should be unambiguously defined in that it is associative, satisfying the following equation – here called the the first “monad law”:
(3)bind ℰprog 34∘(bind ℰprog 23∘prog 12)=bind ℰ(bind ℰprog 34∘prog 23)∘prog 12.
  
  bind^{\mathcal{E}} prog_{34}
  \;\circ\;
  \Big(
    bind^{\mathcal{E}}
    prog_{23}
    \;\circ\;
    prog_{12}
  \Big)
  \;\;\;=\;\;\;
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}
  \Big(
    bind^{\mathcal{E}}
    prog_{34}
    \;\circ\;
    prog_{23}
  \Big)
  \;\circ\;
  prog_{12}
  \,.


Finally, for such a notion of effectful programs to be usefully connected to “pure” programs without effects, it ought to be the case that for any program prog 01:D 0→D 1prog_{01} \,\colon\, D_0 \xrightarrow{\;} D_1 that happens to have no ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects, we have a prescription for how to regard it as an ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful program in a trivial way. For that purpose there should be defined an operation
(4)ret D:D→ℰ(D)  
  
  ret_{D} \;\colon\; D \xrightarrow{\;} \mathcal{E}(D)


which does nothing but “return” data of type DD, but re-regarded as effectful ℰ(D)\mathcal{E}(D)-data in a trivial way; so that we may construct the trivially effectful program ret D 1 𝒟prog 01:D 0→ℰ(D 1)ret^{\mathcal{D}}_{D_1} prog_{01} \;\colon\; D_0 \xrightarrow{\;} \mathcal{E}(D_1).

For instance, in the above example of log-message effects this would be the operation D→D×StringD \to D \times String which assigns the empty string ret Write:d↦(d,∅)ret^{Write} \;\colon\; d \mapsto (d, \varnothing).
In the other example above, of exception handling, the trivial effect D→D⊔StringD \to D \sqcup String is just not to throw an exception, which is just ret Excep:d↦dret^{Excep} \;\colon\; d \mapsto d (the right coprojection into the coproduct).

The final consistency condition (i.e. the remaining “monad law”) then is that “carrying along trivial effects is indeed the trivial operation”, i.e. that
(5)bind ℰprog 01∘ret D 0(−)=prog 01andbind ℰret D 1∘prog 01(−)=prog 01.
  
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}
  prog_{01}
  \;\circ\;
  ret_{D_0}(-)
  \;=\;
  prog_{01}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \text{and}
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}
  ret_{D_1}
  \;\circ\;
  prog_{01}(-)
  \;=\;
  prog_{01}
  \,.


Notice that the associativity condition (3) and the unitality condition (5) are jointly equivalent to saying that data types with hom-sets of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs between them, in the above sense, form a category. In category theory this is known as the Kleisli category Kl(ℰ)Kl(\mathcal{E}) of a monad ℰ\mathcal{E} on the category TypeType of data types with programs between them:
(6)Obj(Kl(ℰ)) = Obj(Type) Hom(Kl(ℰ))(D 1,D 2) = Hom(Type)(D 1,ℰ(D 2)) (−)∘ Kl(ℰ)(−) = (−)∘ Typebind ℰ(−).
  
  \begin{array}{rcl}
    Obj\Big( Kl(\mathcal{E}) \Big)
    &\;\;=\;\;&
    Obj\Big(
      Type
    \Big)
    \\
    Hom\Big( Kl(\mathcal{E}) \Big)\big(D_1,\, D_2\big)
    &\;\;=\;\;&
    Hom\Big(
      Type
    \Big)
    \big(
      D_1, 
      \,
      \mathcal{E}(D_2)  
    \big)
    \\
    (-) \circ_{\mathrm{Kl}(\mathcal{E})} (-)
    &\;\;=\;\;&
    (-) \circ_{Type} bind^{\mathcal{E}}(-)
    \,.
  \end{array}



Traditionally in category theory, the axioms on monads are presented in a somewhat different way, invoking a monad “product” natural transformation ℰ∘ℰ→μℰ\mathcal{E} \circ \mathcal{E} \xrightarrow{ \mu } \mathcal{E} instead of the “binding” operation. One readily checks that these two axiomatic presentations of monads are in fact equal – see (7) below –, but the above “Kleisli triple/extension system”-presentation is typically more relevant in the practice of functional programming.

In summary, a choice of assignments (but see below) to data types D iD_i of


ℰ(D):Type\mathcal{E}(D) \;\colon\; Type,
namely of types of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful data of nominal type DD (1);


bind D 1,D 2 ℰ:Hom(D 1,ℰ(D 2))⟶Hom(ℰ(D 1),ℰ(D 2))bind^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_1, D_2} \;\colon\;  Hom\big(D_1,\, \mathcal{E}(D_2)\big) \longrightarrow Hom\big(\mathcal{E}(D_1),\,\mathcal{E}(D_2)\big),
namely of how to execute a prog while carrying along any previous effects (2);


ret D ℰ:D→ℰ(D)ret^{\mathcal{E}}_D \;\colon\; D \to \mathcal{E}(D),
namely of how to regard plain DD-data as trivially effectful (4)


subject to:


the associativity condition (3)


the unitality condition (5)


is called a monad in computer science (also: “Kleisli triple” in functional programming) and serves to encode the notion that all programs may be subject to certain external effects of a kind ℰ\mathcal{E} that is specified by the above choices of monad operations.
Here, for the time being (but see below), we write Hom(D 1,D 2)Hom(D_1, D_2) for the set of programs/functions taking data of type D 1D_1 to data of D 2D_2 (the hom set in the plain category of types).

The first running example above is known as the writer monad, since it encodes the situation where programs may have the additional effect of writing a message string into a given buffer.
The other running example above is naturally called the exception monad.


Relation to other familiar axioms for monads. The above Kleisli/extension-structure, making a Kleisli-style monad in computer science, may and often is encoded in different equivalent ways:
Alternatively postulating operations


D↦ℰ(D)D \mapsto \mathcal{E}(D) (as before)


fmap D 1,D 2 ℰ:Hom(D 1→D 2)⟶Hom(ℰ(D 1),ℰ(D 2))fmap^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_1, D_2} \;\colon\; Hom\big(D_1 \to D_2\big) \longrightarrow Hom\big(\mathcal{E}(D_1), \mathcal{E}(D_2)\big)


ret D ℰ:D→ℰ(D)ret^{\mathcal{E}}_D \;\colon\; D \to \mathcal{E}(D)


join D ℰ:ℰ(ℰ(D))→ℰ(D)join^{\mathcal{E}}_D \;\colon\; \mathcal{E}\big( \mathcal{E}(D) \big) \to \mathcal{E}(D)


such that


fmap ℰfmap^{\mathcal{E}} is functorial on data types,


join ℰjoin^{\mathcal{E}} is associative and unital (with respect to retret) as a natural transformation,


yields the definition of monad more traditionally used in category theory (namely as a monoid object in endofunctors, here on the plain category of data types).
Direct inspection shows that one may bijectively transmute such bindbind- and joinjoin-operators into each other by expressing them as the following composites (using category theory-notation, for instance “ev” denotes the evaluation map):
(7) fmap D 1,D 2 ℰ:Hom(D 1,D 2)→ret∘(−)Hom(D 1,ℰ(D 2))→bindHom(ℰ(D 1),ℰ(D 2))  join D ℰ:ℰ(ℰ(D))→(id ℰℰ(D),name(id ℰD))ℰℰD×Hom(ℰ(D),ℰ(D))→bindℰ(D) and conversely:  bind D,D′ ℰ:ℰ(D)×Hom(ℰ(D),ℰ(D′))→(id ℰD,fmap D,ℰD′)ℰ(D)×Hom(ℰ(D),ℰℰ(D′))→evℰℰ(D′)→joinD′.

  \;\colon\;
  Hom\big(D_1, D_2\big)
  \xrightarrow{ ret \circ (-) }
  Hom\big(D_1,\, \mathcal{E}(D_2) \big)
  \xrightarrow{ bind }
  Hom\big( \mathcal{E}(D_1),\, \mathcal{E}(D_2) \big)
  \\
  &
  join^{\mathcal{E}}_D
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{E}\big( \mathcal{E}(D) \big)
  \xrightarrow{
    \big( 
      id_{ \mathcal{E} \mathcal{E}(D) }, 
      name(id_{ \mathcal{E} D })  
    \big)
  }
  \mathcal{E} \mathcal{E} D \times Hom\big( \mathcal{E}(D),\, \mathcal{E}(D) \big)
  \xrightarrow{ bind }
  \mathcal{E}(D)
  \\
  \text{and conversely:}
  \\
  &
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}_{D, D'}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{E}(D) \times Hom\big( \mathcal{E}(D),\, \mathcal{E}(D')  \big)
  \xrightarrow{
    \big(
      id_{\mathcal{E} D}, fmap_{D, \mathcal{E} D'}
    \big)
  }
  \mathcal{E} (D) \times Hom\big( \mathcal{E}(D) , \mathcal{E}\mathcal{E}(D') \big)
  \xrightarrow{\;
    ev
  \;}
  \mathcal{E} \mathcal{E}(D')
  \xrightarrow{\; join \;}
  D'
  \,.
  \end{array}


Refined idea: Internal monads
But in fact, in functional programming-languages one typically considers an enhanced version of the above situation:
In these higher-order languages one has, besides the (hom-)set of programs/functions Hom(D 1,D 2)Hom\big(D_1, \, D_2\big) also the actual data type of functions, namely the function type D 1→D 2D_1 \to D_2, which in terms of categorical semantics is the internal hom-object Map(D 1,D 2)Map(D_1, \, D_2) in the cartesian closed category of data types. Therefore, in such languages (like Haskell) the type of the binding operation for given data types D 1D_1, D 2D_2 is actually taken to be the function type/internal hom
bind D 1,D 2 ℰ:  (D 1→ℰ(D 2))→(ℰ(D 1)→ℰ(D 2))  ≃ ℰ(D 1)×(D 1→ℰ(D 2))→ℰ(D 2)  ≃ ℰ(D 1)→((D 1→ℰ(D 2))→ℰ(D 2))
  \begin{array}{ll}
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_1, D_2}
  \;\colon\;
  &&
  \big(
     D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \big)
  \to
  \big(
    \mathcal{E}(D_1)
    \to
    \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \big)
  \\
  &\simeq &
  \mathcal{E}(D_1) 
  \times
  \big(
     D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \big)
  \to
    \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \\
  & \simeq &
  \mathcal{E}(D_1) 
  \to 
  \Big(
    \big(
       D_1 \to \mathcal{E}(D_2)
    \big)
    \to
      \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \Big)
  \end{array}



(where we used the hom-isomorphism of the product⊣\dashvinternal hom-adjunction to re-identify the types on the right)

which (beware) is traditionally written without many of the parenthesis, as follows:
bind D 1,D 2 ℰ:ℰD 1→(D 1→ℰD 2)→ℰD 2.
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_1, D_2}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{E} D_1
    \to 
  \big(
    D_1
    \to
    \mathcal{E} D_2
  \big)
  \to
  \mathcal{E} D_2
  \,.


In general (except in the base topos of Sets), such an iterated function type/internal hom is richer than (certainly different from) the corresponding plain hom set, and accordingly a “Kleisli triple” defined as above but with the binding operation typed in this internal way is more information than a plain monad on the underlying category of types: namely what is called a strong monad (eg. McDermott & Uustalu (2022)).
On such a strong monad, the bind operation is defined as the following composite:
ℰ(D 1)×ℰMap(D 1,D 2)→strength ℰℰ(D 1×Map(D 1,ℰD 2))→ℰeval D 1,ℰD 2ℰℰD 2→μ D 2ℰD 2.
  \mathcal{E}(D_1) \times \mathcal{E} Map(D_1,\,D_2)
    \xrightarrow{\; strength_{\mathcal{E}} \;}
  \mathcal{E}\big(D_1 \times Map(D_1, \, \mathcal{E} D_2) \big) 
    \xrightarrow{
      \mathcal{E} eval_{D_1, \mathcal{E} D_2}
    } 
  \mathcal{E} \mathcal{E} D_2 
    \xrightarrow{\;
      \mu_{D_2}
    \;} 
  \mathcal{E} D_2
  \,.


This makes the monads be enriched monads in the self-enrichment of the category of types given by the function type/internal hom.
In particular, monads as used in Haskell are really strong/enriched monads, in this way.

Yet more structure on effect-monads is available in dependent type theories with type universes, where one may demand that the monad operation D↦T(D)D \mapsto T(D) is not just an endofunction on the set of types, but an endomorphism of the type universe. At least for idempotent monads this case is further discussed at reflective subuniverse and modal type theory and maybe elsewhere.
Further idea: Monad modules
Further in the practice of programming: if programs may cause external effects, as above, then one will often want to have some of them handle these effects.

This is particularly evident in the above running examples of exceptions whose whole design purpose typically is to be handled when they arise.

Since a “handling” of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects should mean that these be done with and turned into pure data of some actual type DD, an ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect handler on(to) a data type DD should primarily consist of a program of the form
ℰ(D)→D.
  \mathcal{E}(D) \to D
  \,.


that handles effects produced by ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs D′→ℰ(D)D' \to \mathcal{E}(D), turning them into pure computations D′→DD' \to D.
But in addition, such a handler needs to handle effects that have been “carried along” (2) from previous computations, even along otherwise in-effectful computations prog 0,1:D 0→D 1prog_{0,1} \;\colon\; D_{0} \to D_{1}; therefore all these need to be assigned handlers:
hndl D 2 ℰprog 1,2:ℰ(D 1)→D 2.
  hndl^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_2} prog_{1,2} 
  \;\colon\; 
  \mathcal{E}(D_1) \to D_2
  \,.


Of such choice of effect handling, consistency demands that:


first handling all previous effects carried along (2) and then the newly produced effects by a given prog:D→ℰ(D′)prog \,\colon\, D \to \mathcal{E}(D') has the same result as letting progprog take care of carrying along previous effects by passing to prog[−]prog[-] and then handling the resulting accumulation at once:


handling the trivial effect ought to be no extra operation:


(8)




A data structure consisting of such assignments hndl ℰhndl^{\mathcal{E}} subject to these “laws” is known as an Kleisli triple algebra (e.g. Uustalu (2021), Lec. 2) or algebra over an extension system (see here) for ℰ\mathcal{E} and is bijectively the same as what in traditional category theory is known as an algebra over 


ℰ

\mathcal{E}

 or ℰ\mathcal{E}-algebra or, maybe best: an ℰ\mathcal{E}-module or ℰ\mathcal{E}-modal type.
Given a pair of such ℰ\mathcal{E}-modal types (D 1,hndl D 1 ℰ)\big(D_1, hndl^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_1} \big), (D 2,hndl D 2 ℰ)\big(D_2, hndl^{\mathcal{E}}_{D_2} \big), a function ϕ:D 1→D 2\phi \,\colon\, D_1 \to D_2 is a homomorphism between them if the result of handling ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects before or after applying ϕ\phi is the same, hence if for all functions f:D 0→D 1f \,\colon\, D_0 \to D_1 the following diagram commutes:




 Free ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect handlers. Notice that above we motivated already the binding operation (2) as a kind of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect handling: namely as the “carrying along” of previous ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects. This intuition now becomes a precise statement:
For any D 2:TypeD_2 \;\colon\; Type we may tautologically handle (8) ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects by absorbing them into the data type ℰ(D 2)\mathcal{E}(D_2), with the effect-handler simply being the effect-binding operation (2):
(9)hndl ℰ(D 2) ℰ(D 1→progℰ(D 2))≔bind ℰprog:ℰ(D 1)→ℰ(D 2).
  
  hndl^{\mathcal{E}}_{\mathcal{E}(D_2)}
  \Big(
     D_1 
     \xrightarrow{ prog }
     \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \Big)
  \;\coloneqq\;
  bind^{\mathcal{E}}
  prog
  \;\colon\;
  \mathcal{E}(D_1)
  \to
  \mathcal{E}(D_2)
  \,.


The ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect-handlers (8) arising this way are called free.
The full subcategory of free ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect handlers among all ℰ\mathcal{E}-modal types is known as the Kleisli category. By the Kleisli equivalence, this is equivalent to the (plain) category (6) of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs that we started with. Here this means that:

Plain data types with ℰ\mathcal{E}-effectful programs betweem them are equivalently data types freely equipped with the structure of ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect handlers.

which makes a lot of sense.

Dual idea: Comonadic contexts
(…) e.g. Uustalu & Vene (2008), POM13, GKOBU16, KRU20 (…):
By formal duality:


On the one hand:


A Kleisli map for a monad ℰ\mathcal{E} is a program
prog:D→ℰ(D′) 
  prog \;\colon\; D \to \mathcal{E}(D')


causing an external ℰ\mathcal{E}-effect.


A Kleisli-module for a monad ℰT\mathcal{E}T is a prescription
hdl D ℰid D:ℰ(D)→D
  hdl^{\mathcal{E}}_D id_D \;\colon\; \mathcal{E}(D) \to D


for handling such ℰ\mathcal{E}-effects.




Dually:


A co-Kleisli map for a comonad 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a program
prog:𝒞(D)→D′
  prog \;\colon\; \mathcal{C}(D) \to D'


subject to an external 𝒞\mathcal{C}-“context” (Uustalu & Vene (2008), POM13)
(a 𝒞\mathcal{C}-cause).


A co-Kleisli co-module for a comonad 𝒞\mathcal{C} is a program
prvd D 𝒞id D:D→𝒞(D)
  prvd^{\mathcal{C}}_D id_D \;\colon\; D \to \mathcal{C}(D)


producing or providing such 𝒞\mathcal{C}-contexts.
(cf. [Uustalu (2021), Lect. 3, slide 9])

Definable monads
Various monads are definable in terms of standard type-forming operations (such as product types, function types, etc.). These include the following.


The maybe monad encodes possible controlled failure of a program to execute.


An exception monad, more generally, encodes possible controlled failure together with the output of an error “message” in the general form of data of some type.


The reader monad and coreader comonad both encode reading out a global parameter.


The state monad encodes the possibility of consecutive reading and re-setting a global parameter – this provides a notion of random access memory.


The costate comonad encodes a way (a “lens”) to read and write fields in databases.


The writer monad encodes writing consecutively into a global resource, such as for a stream.


The continuation monad encodes continuation-passing style of program execution.


The selection monad encodes selecting a value of a type depending on the values of some function on it.


State monad and Random access memory
A functional program with input of type XX, output of type YY and mutable state SS is a function (morphism) of type X×S⟶Y×SX \times S \longrightarrow Y \times S. Under the (Cartesian product ⊣\dashv internal hom)-adjunction this is equivalently given by its adjunct, which is a function of type X⟶[S,S×Y]X \longrightarrow [S, S \times Y ]. Here the operation [S,S×(−)][S, S\times (-)] is the monad induced by the above adjunction and this latter function is naturally regarded as a morphism in the Kleisli category of this monad. This monad [S,S×(−)][S, S\times (-)] is called the state monad for mutable states of type S.
Maybe monad and Controlled failure
The maybe monad is the operation X↦X∐*X \mapsto X \coprod \ast. The idea here is that a function X⟶YX \longrightarrow Y in its Kleisli category is in the original category a function of the form X⟶Y∐*X \longrightarrow Y \coprod \ast  so either returns indeed a value in YY or else returns the unique element of the unit type/terminal object *\ast. This is then naturally interpreted as “no value returned”, hence as indicating a “failure in computation”.
Exception monad and Exception handling

Axiomatic monads
Other monads may be supplied “axiomatically” by the programming language, meaning that they are data structures typed as monads, but whose actual type formation, binding- and return-operations are special purpose operations provided by the programming environment.
This includes:


the IO monad in Haskell,


the completion monad, as in constructive analysis, used for dealing for instance with real numbers.


In this vein:

Equipping homotopy type theory (say implemented as a programming language concretely in Coq or Agda) with two axiomatic idempotent monads, denoted ♯\sharp and Π\Pi, with some additional data and relations, turns it into cohesive homotopy type theory. See also modal type theory.

Homotopy type theory is a flavor of type theory – specifically of intensional dependent type theory – which takes seriously the natural interpretation of identity types or path types as formalizing path space objects in homotopy theory. Examples of homotopy type theory include variants of Martin-Löf type theory and cubical type theory which have univalent universes and higher inductive types, as well as higher observational type theory.
In the categorical semantics of homotopy type theory, types are interpreted not as set-like objects, but as homotopy type- or ∞-groupoid/∞-stack-like objects. Thus, whereas extensional type theory can serve as the internal language of 1-categories (such as pretoposes, locally cartesian closed categories, or elementary toposes), homotopy type theory can serve as an internal language for various kinds of (∞,1)-category (such as locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories and (∞,1)-toposes). At present, such models are usually constructed by way of 1-categorical presentations of (∞,1)-categories using type-theoretic model categories and related structures such as weak factorization systems.
In addition to a viewpoint on identity types and a general class of categorical models, homotopy type theory is characterized by new homotopically motivated axioms and type-theoretic structures. Notable among these are:


Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which represents object classifiers in (∞,1)-categorical semantics.


Strong function extensionality, which is a consequence of univalence.


Higher inductive types, which among other things enable the construction of finite (∞,1)-colimits, cell complexes, truncations, localizations, and other objects which in classical homotopy theory are constructed using the small object argument.


With all of these axioms included, homotopy type theory behaves like the internal language of an (∞,1)-topos, and conjecturally should admit actual models in any (∞,1)-topos. With fewer axioms and type constructors, it is known to admit models in more weakly structured (∞,1)-categories — see below.
Many details are still being worked out, but the impression is that homotopy type theory thus should serve as a foundation for mathematics that is natively about homotopy theory/(∞,1)-category theory — in other words, a foundation in which homotopy types, rather than sets, are basic objects.
Advantages
As a foundation for mathematics, homotopy type theory (also called univalent foundations) has the following advantages. Many of these advantages are shared with some other foundational systems, but no other known system shares all of these, and some are unique to HoTT.


It treats homotopy theory and ∞-groupoids natively. This is an advantage for doing homotopical and higher-categorical mathematics, which is spreading slowly into other fields.


It inherits the good computational properties of intensional Martin-Löf type theory. Some of its new axioms, such as univalence and function extensionality, are not fully understood yet from a computational perspective, but progress is being made. [This paragraph should be updated in view of the computational interpretation of univalence by the cubical model.]


It is constructive by default, but can easily be made classical by adding axioms. This makes it potentially more expressive at essentially no cost. (In fact, it is not entirely clear how possible it is to do homotopy theory constructively in other foundations.)


It can (conjecturally) be internalized in many categories and higher categories, providing an internal logic which enables a single proof to be reinterpreted in many places with many different meanings.


It is naturally isomorphism- and equivalence-invariant (respecting the principle of equivalence). This is a consequence of the univalence axiom: any property or structure (even one which speaks only about sets and makes no reference to homotopy theory) which is expressible in the theory must be invariant under isomorphism/equivalence.


Notions such as propositions and sets are defined objects, which inherit good computational properties from the underlying type theory.


It treats sets, groupoids, and higher groupoids on an equal footing. One can easily remain entirely in the fragment of the theory which talks about sets, not worrying about groupoids or homotopy theory, but as soon as one starts to say something which naturally needs structures of higher homotopy level (such as talking about some collection of structured sets), the groupoidal and homotopical structure is already there.


Models in (∞,1)(\infty,1)-categories and (∞,1)(\infty,1)-toposes
It is well known that extensional dependent type theory is an internal logic for locally cartesian closed categories. See at relation between type theory and category theory.
The step from extensional to intensional type theory and the identity types that this brings with it makes intensional dependent type theory have models in certain (∞,1)-categories. This connection is usually shown by means of a presentation of the (∞,1)(\infty,1)-category using a weak factorization system, a category of fibrant objects, a model category, or other similar structure.
It is conjectured (due to Awodey 09, Awodey, 2010, Joyal, 2011, see Awodey's conjecture) that


intensional dependent type theory with dependent sums and products and function extensionality (a form of homotopy type theory) is an internal language for locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories; and


with the univalence axiom added, it becomes an internal language for (∞,1)-toposes.


Indeed:

Proposition
Every presentable and locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category has a presentation by a type-theoretic model category. This provides the categorical semantics for homotopy type theory (without, possibly, the univalence axiom).

For more on this see at locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-category in the section on internal logic.
With the univalence axiom included (for a type of types “weakly a la Tarski”) then homotopy type theory has categorical semantics in (∞,1)-toposes, with the type of types interpreted as the object classifier.

New Axioms
As a foundation for mathematics whose basic objects are higher groupoids, homotopy type theory makes visible new foundational axioms. Most of these axioms are true as statements about classical ∞\infty-groupoids, but may be false in “nonclassical” models of homotopy type theory such as (∞,1)-toposes.

Several variants of the axiom of choice.


Additionally, since homotopy type theory as the internal language of (∞,1)(\infty, 1)-toposes is not classical, it is possible to add classically inconsistent axioms, just as, say, the Kock-Lawvere axiom may be added to ordinary topos theory.

The term modal logic refers to an enrichment of standard formal logic, where the standard logical conjunctions (and, or, not, implication and, perhaps, for all, exists etc.) are accompanied by certain extra operations – called modal operators and traditionally denoted by symbols like “□\Box”, “◊\lozenge”, , “◯\bigcirc” – such that for pp any proposition an expression like □p\Box p is a(nother) proposition whose interpretation is intended to be:

“pp holds (only) in a certain way”,

where the “certain way” is (implicitly) specified by whatever axioms are satisfied by the given modal operator.
In other words, modal operators in modal logic are meant to express a certain mode of being true — and in generalization to modal type theory they express more generally a mode of being, whence the reference to Kant‘s modalities.
For example (see also pointers below):


in epistemic logic one considers modal operators meant to express that
“pp is necessarily true”, or that “pp is possibly true”
(often read as “necessarily known to be true” etc., whence the reference to epistemology);


in temporal logic one considers modal operators meant to express that
“pp will eventually become true”, etc.;


in doxastic logic one is concerned with statements such as:
“pp is believed to be true”, etc.


Beware however that there is no broad agreement on which further axioms exactly make a general modal operator — which in itself is any (co-)monad on the underlying universe of propositions (of types), see below — encode/reflect any such intended “mode of being (true)”. As a result:

‘Ask three modal logicians what modal logic is, and you are likely to get at least three different answers’. [Blackburn, deRijke & Venema (2001), Introduction]

Historically, the default example of a modal logic is known as S4 modal logic, originally motivated as a model for epistemic logic (with a modality for being “necessarily true”), but really just axiomatizing (propositional logic equipped with) any co-monad □\Box on the universe of propositions, without further specification. There are variants known as T modal logic and K modal logic which drop some of the axioms even on this comonad, but it seems good practice to agree that a modal operator is at least a (co-)monad on the universe of propositions (of types).
In this sense, modal logic is the counterpart in the computational trilogy to:


category theory with (co-)monads (categorical algebra),


computer science with (co-)monads in computer science (computational effects).


A traditional semantics considered for modal logics is in terms of sets with relations, called Kripke frames. Specifically for epistemic logic this is also known as possible worlds semantics. However, the canonical categorical semantics for epistemic logic is arguably in categorical models of dependent types, as explained here.
There is also algebraic semantics in terms of algebras with (co)-closure operators. For instance, temporal logics can have posets as models.
Here is a brief list of flavors of modal logic. More details are discussed below.


epistemic logics: it is known to XX that, it is common knowledge that;


temporal logic: henceforth, eventually, hitherto, previously, now, tomorrow, yesterday, since, until, inevitably, finally, ultimately, endlessly, it will have been, it is being …


dynamic logic?: after the program/computation/action finishes, the program enables, throughout the computation;


doxastic logic: it is believed that


deontic logic: it is obligatory/forbidden/permitted/unlawful that


geometric logic: it is locally the case that


metalogic: it is valid/satisfiable/provable/consistent that (Goldblatt).
The metalogical version was important in the history of modern modal logic. Gödel played an important role there.

In formal logic, by syntax one means formal specification of the (language of) a theory – this in contrast to semantics.
In linguistics the meaning of syntax is similar, but a little different and narrower (does not include phonological, morphological and lexical levels of descriptions), see syntax (linguistics).
Semantics is the interpretation of the syntax of a theory in a model.
See a separate page for semantics of a programming language.
In model theory, a model of a theory is a realization of the types, operations, relations, and axioms of that theory. In ordinary model theory one usually studies mainly models in sets, but in categorical logic we study models in other categories, especially in topoi.
The term structure is often used to mean a realization of types, operations, and relations in some signature, but not satisfying any particular axioms. This is of course the same as a model for the “empty theory” in that signature, which has the same types, operations, and relations, but no axioms at all. One then talks about whether a given structure is, or is not, a model of a given theory in a given signature.
In first-order theories
The basic concept is of a structure for a first-order language LL: a set MM together with an interpretation of LL in MM. A theory TT is specified by a language and a set of sentences in LL.
An LL-structure MM is a model of TT if for every sentence ϕ\phi in TT, its interpretation in MM, ϕ M\phi^M is true (“ϕ\phi holds in MM”).
We say that TT is consistent or satisfiable (relative to the universe in which we do model theory) if there exist at least one model for TT (in our universe). Two theories, T 1T_1, T 2T_2 are said to be equivalent if they have the same models.
Given a class KK of structures for LL, there is a theory Th(K)Th(K) consisting of all sentences in LL which hold in every structure from KK. Two structures MM and NN are elementary equivalent (sometimes written by equality M=NM=N, sometimes said “elementarily equivalent”) if Th(M)=Th(N)Th(M)=Th(N), i.e. if they satisfy the same sentences in LL. Any set of sentences which is equivalent to Th(K)Th(K) is called a set of axioms of KK. A theory is said to be finitely axiomatizable if there exist a finite set of axioms for KK.
A theory is said to be complete if it is equivalent to Th(M)Th(M) for some structure MM.
For Lawvere theories
For Syn(T)Syn(T) the syntactic category of an algebraic theory (where Syn(T)Syn(T) is perhaps better known as a Lawvere theory), and for CC any category with finite limits, a model for TT in CC is a product-preserving functor
N:Syn(T)→C.
  N : Syn(T) \to C
  \,.


The category of models in this case is hence the full subcategory of the functor category [Syn(T),C][Syn(T),C] on product-preserving functors.

For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
An object in the essential image of coDisccoDisc is called a codiscrete object.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc)ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
If one thinks of ℰ\mathcal{E} as a category of spaces, then the codiscrete objects are called codiscrete spaces.
The dual notion is that of discrete objects.


Proposition
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.



Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has a terminal object that is preserved by Γ\Gamma, then ℰ\mathcal{E} has concrete objects.

This is (Shulman, theorem 1).

Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has codiscrete objects and has pullbacks that are preserved by Γ\Gamma and , then Γ\Gamma is a Grothendieck fibration.

This is (Shulman, theorem 2).
A monad is a structure that is a lot like a monoid, but that lives in a bicategory rather than a monoidal category. In other words, the concept of a monad is a vertical categorification of that of a monoid.
Monads are among the most pervasive structures in category theory and its applications (notably to categorical algebra). For their applications to computer science, see monads in computer science.
Many of these applications use monads in the bicategory Cat, which is called a monad on a category. These are central to the category-theoretic account of universal algebra, as well as underlying the theory of simplicial objects and thus, via the Dold-Kan correspondence, much of homological algebra.
Monads
A monad in a bicategory KK is given by


an object aa, together with


an endomorphism t:a→at \colon a \to a, and


2-cellsη:1 a→t\;\eta \colon 1_a \to t (the unit of tt) and μ:t∘t→t\mu \colon t \circ t \to t (the multiplication)


such that the diagrams 

















































































 



























































 commute (where certain coherence isomorphisms have been omitted).
The name “monad” and the terms “unit”, “multiplication” and “associativity” bear a clear analogy with monoids (but see also at monad (disambiguation)). Indeed, one can define a monad on an object aa of a bicategory KK as just a monoid object in the endomorphism category K(a,a)K(a,a). Alternatively, monads can be taken as more fundamental, and a monoid in a monoidal category CC can be defined as a monad in BC\mathbf{B} C, the one-object bicategory corresponding to CC.
A third and somewhat less obvious definition says that a monad in KK is a lax 2-functor from the terminal bicategory 11 to KK: the unique object *\ast of 11 is sent to the object aa, the morphism 1 a1_a becomes tt, and η\eta and μ\mu arise from the coherent 2-cells expressing lax functoriality. This in turn is equivalent to saying that a monad is a category enriched in a bicategory with a single object and single morphism. Among higher-category theorists, it’s tempting to suggest that this is the most fundamental definition, and the most basic reason for the ubiquity and importance of monads. Regardless of this, however, the earlier more elementary definitions are both practically and pedagogically essential.
Finally, a monad can be defined in terms of the “Kleisli operation” taking any map a→Tba \to T b to a map Ta→TbT a \to T b; see extension system.
We can picture a monad in KK as an image of the third oriental in KK. See the remarks at monoidal category.
The data of and axioms for a monad can be expressed graphically as string diagrams. Writing T:C→C,η,μT \colon C \to C, \eta, \mu for the monad in question (this notation being the standard one when K=CatK = Cat), these data can be represented as

Thanks to the distinctive shapes, one can usually omit the labels:

The axioms then appear as:

Monads in CatCat are sometimes, mostly in older literature, also called triples (alluding to the triple of data (A,μ,i)(A,\mu,i)), following Eilenberg and Moore, or triads. In even older literature, they are also referred to as standard constructions, the original term used by Godement when he introduced the idea, or fundamental constructions. For terminological remarks by Ross Street see category-list here.
The bicategory of monads
Given the equivalence between monads in KK and lax functors 1→K1 \to K it is straightforward to define the bicategory Mnd(K)Mnd(K) of monads in KK to be the lax functor category [1,K] ℓ[1,K]_\ell, which consists of lax functors, lax transformations and modifications.
Spelling this out, we see that an object of Mnd(K)Mnd(K) is a monad (a,t,η,μ)(a,t,\eta,\mu) in KK. A morphism of monads (a,t)→(b,s)(a,t) \to (b,s) is given by 1-cell x:a→bx \colon a \to b together with a 2-cell λ:sx→xt\lambda \colon s x \to x t satisfying
x →η sx sx xη t↓  ↓λ xt →1 xtssx →sλ sxt →λt xtt μ sx↓    ↓xμ t sx  →λ  xt
\array{
  x & \stackrel{\eta^s x}{\to} & s x \\
  \mathllap{x \eta^t} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\lambda} \\
  x t & \stackrel{1}{\to} & x t
}\qquad \qquad
\array{
 s s x & \stackrel{s \lambda}{\to} & s x t & \stackrel{\lambda t}{\to}
 & x t t \\
 \mathllap{\mu^s x} \downarrow & & & & \downarrow \mathrlap{x \mu^t}
 \\
 s x & & \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} & & x t
}


Finally, a 2-cell (x,λ)⇒(y,κ)(x,\lambda) \Rightarrow (y, \kappa) is given by a 2-cell m:x⇒ym \colon x \Rightarrow y satisfying
sx →sm sy λ↓  ↓κ xt →mt yt
\array{
 s x & \stackrel{s m}{\to} & s y \\
 \mathllap{\lambda} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\kappa} \\
 x t & \stackrel{m t}{\to} & y t
}


Algebras/modules over a monad
Given that a monad in a bicategory ℬ\mathcal{B} is nothing but a monoid object in a hom-category ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a), it is natural to consider a module over this monoid: a module for a monad. This notion of module is more general than a module in a monoidal category, however, since it need not live in ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a) but can be in ℬ(b,a)\mathcal{B}(b,a) (for left modules) or ℬ(a,c)\mathcal{B}(a,c) (for right modules).
In a Cat-like bicategory, left modules over a monad are usually known as algebras over the monad. This terminology is confusing from the point of view of monads as monoids, but is justified because in Cat itself, such algebras with domain 1 are just algebras for a monad in the classical sense. Such algebras are a powerful tool to encode general algebraic structures; this is the topic of universal algebra. The algebras over a monad form its Eilenberg-Moore category, which is characterized by a universal property.
Some monads arise from operads, in which case algebras for the monad are the same as algebras for the operad. A Lawvere theory is another special sort of monad in CatCat.
Relation to adjunctions and monadicity
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) induces a monad R∘LR \circ L and a comonad L∘RL \circ R. There is in general more than one adjunction which gives rise to a given monad this way, in fact there is a category of adjunctions for a given monad. An adjunction inducing a monad TT is called a resolution of TT. The initial object in that category is the adjunction over the Kleisli category of the monad and the terminal object is that over the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras. (e.g. Borceux, vol. 2, prop. 4.2.2) The latter is called the monadic adjunction.
Moreover, passing from adjunctions to monads and back to their monadic adjunctions constitutes itself an adjunction between adjunctions and monads, called the semantics-structure adjunction.
The analog in the context of (∞,1)-topos theory of a local geometric morphism in topos theory.

Definition
A local (∞,1)-geometric morphism f:H→Sf : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{S} between (∞,1)-toposes H,S\mathbf{H},\mathbf{S} is


an (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(f *⊣f *):H→f *←f *S
  (f^* \dashv f_*) 
   : 
    \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
  {\to}}  \mathbf{S}



such that


a further right adjoint f !:S→Hf^! : \mathbf{S} \to \mathbf{H} to the direct image functor exists:
(f *⊣f *⊣f !):H←f !→f *←f *S
  (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}
   {\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
  \mathbf{S}  



and ff is a ∞-connected (∞,1)-geometric morphism.




If f:H→Sf : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{S} is the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism in the over-(∞,1)-category Topos/S/\mathbf{S}, then we say that H\mathbf{H} is a local (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over S\mathbf{S}.


Remark
If S=\mathbf{S} =  ∞Grpd then the extra condition that ff is ∞-connected (∞,1)-geometric morphism is automatic (see Properties – over ∞Grpd).

Local geometric morphism and relative local topos

Definition
A local geometric morphism f:E→Sf : E \to S between toposes E,SE,S is


a geometric morphism
(f *⊣f *):E→f *←f *S
 (f^* \dashv f_*) \colon E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
 {\to}}  S



such that a further right adjoint f !:S→Ef^! : S \to E exists
(f *⊣f *⊣f !):E⟵f !⟶f *⟵f *S
 (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
 E
 \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f^!}{\longleftarrow}}}
 S



and such that one, hence all, of the following equivalent conditions hold:

The right adjoint f !f^! is an SS-indexed functor.
ff is connected, i.e. f *f^* is fully faithful.
The right adjoint f !f^! is fully faithful.
The right adjoint f !f^! is cartesian closed.




When we regard EE as a topos over SS, so that ff is regarded as its global section geometric morphism in the category of toposes over SS, then we say that EE is a local SS-topos. In this case we may label the functors involved as
(Disc⊣Γ⊣Codisc):E⟵Codisc⟶Γ⟵DiscS
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\longleftarrow}}}
    S


to indicate that if we think of Γ\Gamma as sending a space to its underlying SS-object of points by forgetting cohesion, then DiscDisc creates the discrete space/discrete object and CodiscCodisc the codiscrete space/codiscrete object on an object in SS.
This is especially common when S=S= Set, in which case the final condition is automatic since all functors are SetSet-indexed. Hence in that case we have the following simpler definition.

Definition
A sheaf topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} is a local topos if the global section geometric morphism 𝒯→Γ←LConstSet\mathcal{T} \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} Set has a further right adjoint CoDiscCoDisc, making an adjoint triple (LConst⊣Γ⊣CoDisc)(LConst \dashv \Gamma \dashv CoDisc)
CoDisc:Set↪𝒯.
  CoDisc \colon Set \hookrightarrow \mathcal{T}. 


(As just stated, it is automatic in the case over SetSet that this is furthermore a full and faithful functor.)


Remark
Another way of stating this is that a Grothendieck topos is local if and only if the terminal object 11 is connected and projective (since this means precisely that Γ=hom(1,−)\Gamma = \hom(1, -) preserves colimits, and therefore has a right adjoint by virtue of an adjoint functor theorem). Another term for this: we say 11 is tiny (atomic). Notice the similarity to the concept of amazing right adjoint (the difference being that this is a right adjoint not to the external but to the internal hom out of 1.)

Note also that in an infinitary-extensive category an object is connected as soon as hom(X,−)\hom(X,-) preserves binary coproducts (see connected object). Moreover, a coproduct-preserving functor between toposes preserves coequalizers as soon as it preserves epimorphisms, since any coequalizer can be constructed as the quotient of an equivalence relation generated using images and countable coproducts and quotients of equivalence relations are effective. Thus, we can say that a Grothendieck topos is local iff hom(1,−)\hom(1,-) preserves binary coproducts and epis. Moreover, a cospan A→C←BA \to C \leftarrow B in a topos is a coproduct diagram iff AA and BB are disjoint monos whose union is all of CC; thus hom(1,−)\hom(1,-) preserves binary coproducts as soon as it preserves the initial object and binary unions. This leads to the following equivalent form of “locality” that makes sense even for elementary toposes:

Definition
An elementary topos EE is local if the terminal object 11 is


nonempty: 1≇01\ncong 0,


connected: 1=p∨q1 = p \vee q implies 1=p1 = p or 1=q1 = q, and


projective: every epi U→1U \to 1 admits a section t:1→Ut: 1 \to U.




Remark
Some authors have instead used the term “local” to refer just to the condition that 11 is connected; note this is equivalent to Sub E(1)Sub_E(1) being a local rig. In his thesis, Steve Awodey upgraded this, saying that a topos is hyperlocal if both connectivity and projectivity are satisfied. As argued above, for a Grothendieck topos this is slightly weaker than locality, although the difference is only in the inclusion of the trivial topos (for if 1≅01\cong 0 then E≃1E\simeq 1). Note that a local elementary topos, as defined above, is constructively well-pointed if and only if 11 is additionally a generator.


Example
The free topos is a local elementary topos.

Equivalent characterizations

Proposition
A geometric morphism f:E→Sf : E \to S is local precisely if


there exists a geometric morphism c:S→Ec : S \to E such that f∘c≃idf \circ c \simeq id;


for every other geometric morphism g:G→Sg : G \to S the composite c∘gc\circ g is an initial object in the hom-category Topos /S(g,f)Topos_{/S}(g,f) of the slice 2-category of Topos over SS.



This is (Johnstone, theorem 3.6.1 vi)).

Remark
In particular this means that the category of topos points of a local topos has a contractible nerve.

General

Proposition
The global section geometric morphism of any local 𝒮\mathcal{S}-topos (over a base topos 𝒮\mathcal{S}) is a Grothendieck fibration and a Grothendieck opfibration.

This appears in (Shulman).

Proposition
The Freyd cover of a topos is a local topos, and in fact freely so. Every local topos is a retract of a Freyd cover.

This appears as (Johnstone, lemma C3.6.4).
Homotopy dimension

Proposition
In a local sheaf topos over Set, every inhabited object is globally inhabited:
every object XX for which the unique morphism X→*X \to * to the terminal object is an epimorphism has a global point *→X* \to X.


Proof
Since in a local topos the global section functor Γ\Gamma is a left adjoint, it preserves epimorphisms. Since it is a right adjoint it preserves the terminal object. Therefore Γ(X)→Γ(*)≃*\Gamma(X) \to \Gamma(*) \simeq * is an epimorphism in Set, hence a surjection, meaning that Γ(X)\Gamma(X) is inhabited. Since Γ(X)≃Hom(*,X)\Gamma(X) \simeq Hom(*,X) (see global section geometric morphism), the claim follows.


Remark
In a topos every epimorphism is an effective epimorphism. Therefore X→*X \to * being an epi means that XX is a (-1)-connected object. Therefore the above statement says in terms of (infinity,1)-category theory that a non-trivial local topos has homotopy dimension 0.
The same is true for any local (infinity,1)-topos.

Concrete sheaves
Every local topos Γ:E→S\Gamma : E \to S comes with a notion of concrete sheaves, a reflective subcategory Conc Γ(E)↪EConc_\Gamma(E) \hookrightarrow E which factors the topos inclusion of SS:
S↪Codisc←ΓConc Γ(E)↪←ConcE
  S 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Conc_\Gamma(E) 
    \stackrel{\overset{Conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  E


and is a quasitopos. See concrete sheaf for details.
Homotopy equivalence
Since a local geometric morphism has a left adjoint in the 2-category Topos, it is necessarily a homotopy equivalence of toposes.
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
An object in the essential image of coDisccoDisc is called a codiscrete object.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc)ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
If one thinks of ℰ\mathcal{E} as a category of spaces, then the codiscrete objects are called codiscrete spaces.
The dual notion is that of discrete objects.


Proposition
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.



Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has a terminal object that is preserved by Γ\Gamma, then ℰ\mathcal{E} has concrete objects.

This is (Shulman, theorem 1).

Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has codiscrete objects and has pullbacks that are preserved by Γ\Gamma and , then Γ\Gamma is a Grothendieck fibration.

This is (Shulman, theorem 2).
Given an adjunction
(L⊣R):X⇄RLY
  (L \dashv R)
  \colon\;
  X
    \underoverset{R}{L}{\rightleftarrows}
  Y


there is a natural transformation (or more generally, a 22-morphism) η:id X→R∘L\eta\colon id_X \to R \circ L, called the unit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “front adjunction”). (A reason for the name is that R∘LR \circ L is a monad, which is a kind of monoid object, and η\eta is the identity of this monoid. Since ‘identity’ in this context would suggest an identity natural transformation, we use the synonym ‘unit’.)
Similarly, there is a 22-morphism ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon\colon L \circ R \to id_Y, called the counit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “back adjunction” or “end adjunction”). (This is the co-identity of the comonad L∘RL \circ R.)
General
Unit and counit of an adjunction satisfy the triangle identities.
An adjunct is given by precomposition with a unit or postcomposition with a counit.
The left adjoint L:X→YL : X \to Y is fully faithful (i.e. a coreflection) if and only if the unit η:id X→R∘L\eta : id_X \to R \circ L is a natural isomorphism (if and only if id X≅R∘Lid_X \cong R \circ L by Lemma A1.1.1 of the Elephant). Dually, the right adjoint R:Y→XR : Y \to X is fully faithful (i.e. a reflection) if and only if the counit ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon : L \circ R \to id_Y is a natural isomorphism. (See this Prop. at adjoint functor.)
If the unit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lari (“left adjoint right inverse”); whilst RR is termed rali (“right adjoint left inverse”). Dually, if the counit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lali (“left adjoint left inverse”); whilst RR is termed rari (“right adjoint right inverse”). All four classes of functor are closed under composition, and contain the equivalences.
Relation to monads
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) gives rise to a monad T≔R∘LT \coloneqq R \circ L. The unit of this monad id→Tid \to T is the unit of the adjunction, id→R∘Lid \to R \circ L.
For Γ:ℰ→ℬ\Gamma \colon \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B} a functor we say that it has codiscrete objects if it has a full and faithful right adjoint coDisc:ℬ↪ℰcoDisc : \mathcal{B} \hookrightarrow \mathcal{E}.
An object in the essential image of coDisccoDisc is called a codiscrete object.
This is for instance the case for the global section geometric morphism of a local topos (Disc⊣Γ⊣coDisc)ℰ→ℬ (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv coDisc) \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{B}.
If one thinks of ℰ\mathcal{E} as a category of spaces, then the codiscrete objects are called codiscrete spaces.
The dual notion is that of discrete objects.


Proposition
Γ\Gamma is a faithful functor on morphisms whose codomain is concrete.



Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has a terminal object that is preserved by Γ\Gamma, then ℰ\mathcal{E} has concrete objects.

This is (Shulman, theorem 1).

Proposition
If ℰ\mathcal{E} has codiscrete objects and has pullbacks that are preserved by Γ\Gamma and , then Γ\Gamma is a Grothendieck fibration.

This is (Shulman, theorem 2).
A monad is a structure that is a lot like a monoid, but that lives in a bicategory rather than a monoidal category. In other words, the concept of a monad is a vertical categorification of that of a monoid.
Monads are among the most pervasive structures in category theory and its applications (notably to categorical algebra). For their applications to computer science, see monads in computer science.
Many of these applications use monads in the bicategory Cat, which is called a monad on a category. These are central to the category-theoretic account of universal algebra, as well as underlying the theory of simplicial objects and thus, via the Dold-Kan correspondence, much of homological algebra.
Monads
A monad in a bicategory KK is given by


an object aa, together with


an endomorphism t:a→at \colon a \to a, and


2-cellsη:1 a→t\;\eta \colon 1_a \to t (the unit of tt) and μ:t∘t→t\mu \colon t \circ t \to t (the multiplication)


such that the diagrams 

















































































 



























































 commute (where certain coherence isomorphisms have been omitted).
The name “monad” and the terms “unit”, “multiplication” and “associativity” bear a clear analogy with monoids (but see also at monad (disambiguation)). Indeed, one can define a monad on an object aa of a bicategory KK as just a monoid object in the endomorphism category K(a,a)K(a,a). Alternatively, monads can be taken as more fundamental, and a monoid in a monoidal category CC can be defined as a monad in BC\mathbf{B} C, the one-object bicategory corresponding to CC.
A third and somewhat less obvious definition says that a monad in KK is a lax 2-functor from the terminal bicategory 11 to KK: the unique object *\ast of 11 is sent to the object aa, the morphism 1 a1_a becomes tt, and η\eta and μ\mu arise from the coherent 2-cells expressing lax functoriality. This in turn is equivalent to saying that a monad is a category enriched in a bicategory with a single object and single morphism. Among higher-category theorists, it’s tempting to suggest that this is the most fundamental definition, and the most basic reason for the ubiquity and importance of monads. Regardless of this, however, the earlier more elementary definitions are both practically and pedagogically essential.
Finally, a monad can be defined in terms of the “Kleisli operation” taking any map a→Tba \to T b to a map Ta→TbT a \to T b; see extension system.
We can picture a monad in KK as an image of the third oriental in KK. See the remarks at monoidal category.
The data of and axioms for a monad can be expressed graphically as string diagrams. Writing T:C→C,η,μT \colon C \to C, \eta, \mu for the monad in question (this notation being the standard one when K=CatK = Cat), these data can be represented as

Thanks to the distinctive shapes, one can usually omit the labels:

The axioms then appear as:

Monads in CatCat are sometimes, mostly in older literature, also called triples (alluding to the triple of data (A,μ,i)(A,\mu,i)), following Eilenberg and Moore, or triads. In even older literature, they are also referred to as standard constructions, the original term used by Godement when he introduced the idea, or fundamental constructions. For terminological remarks by Ross Street see category-list here.
The bicategory of monads
Given the equivalence between monads in KK and lax functors 1→K1 \to K it is straightforward to define the bicategory Mnd(K)Mnd(K) of monads in KK to be the lax functor category [1,K] ℓ[1,K]_\ell, which consists of lax functors, lax transformations and modifications.
Spelling this out, we see that an object of Mnd(K)Mnd(K) is a monad (a,t,η,μ)(a,t,\eta,\mu) in KK. A morphism of monads (a,t)→(b,s)(a,t) \to (b,s) is given by 1-cell x:a→bx \colon a \to b together with a 2-cell λ:sx→xt\lambda \colon s x \to x t satisfying
x →η sx sx xη t↓  ↓λ xt →1 xtssx →sλ sxt →λt xtt μ sx↓    ↓xμ t sx  →λ  xt
\array{
  x & \stackrel{\eta^s x}{\to} & s x \\
  \mathllap{x \eta^t} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\lambda} \\
  x t & \stackrel{1}{\to} & x t
}\qquad \qquad
\array{
 s s x & \stackrel{s \lambda}{\to} & s x t & \stackrel{\lambda t}{\to}
 & x t t \\
 \mathllap{\mu^s x} \downarrow & & & & \downarrow \mathrlap{x \mu^t}
 \\
 s x & & \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} & & x t
}


Finally, a 2-cell (x,λ)⇒(y,κ)(x,\lambda) \Rightarrow (y, \kappa) is given by a 2-cell m:x⇒ym \colon x \Rightarrow y satisfying
sx →sm sy λ↓  ↓κ xt →mt yt
\array{
 s x & \stackrel{s m}{\to} & s y \\
 \mathllap{\lambda} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\kappa} \\
 x t & \stackrel{m t}{\to} & y t
}


Algebras/modules over a monad
Given that a monad in a bicategory ℬ\mathcal{B} is nothing but a monoid object in a hom-category ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a), it is natural to consider a module over this monoid: a module for a monad. This notion of module is more general than a module in a monoidal category, however, since it need not live in ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a) but can be in ℬ(b,a)\mathcal{B}(b,a) (for left modules) or ℬ(a,c)\mathcal{B}(a,c) (for right modules).
In a Cat-like bicategory, left modules over a monad are usually known as algebras over the monad. This terminology is confusing from the point of view of monads as monoids, but is justified because in Cat itself, such algebras with domain 1 are just algebras for a monad in the classical sense. Such algebras are a powerful tool to encode general algebraic structures; this is the topic of universal algebra. The algebras over a monad form its Eilenberg-Moore category, which is characterized by a universal property.
Some monads arise from operads, in which case algebras for the monad are the same as algebras for the operad. A Lawvere theory is another special sort of monad in CatCat.
Relation to adjunctions and monadicity
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) induces a monad R∘LR \circ L and a comonad L∘RL \circ R. There is in general more than one adjunction which gives rise to a given monad this way, in fact there is a category of adjunctions for a given monad. An adjunction inducing a monad TT is called a resolution of TT. The initial object in that category is the adjunction over the Kleisli category of the monad and the terminal object is that over the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras. (e.g. Borceux, vol. 2, prop. 4.2.2) The latter is called the monadic adjunction.
Moreover, passing from adjunctions to monads and back to their monadic adjunctions constitutes itself an adjunction between adjunctions and monads, called the semantics-structure adjunction.

Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
For (Π⊣Γ⊣LConst):H→∞Grpd(\Pi \dashv \Gamma \dashv LConst) :  \mathbf{H} \to \infty Grpd a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos and X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} an object, we say that Π(X)\Pi(X) is the fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid of XX in H\mathbf{H}.


This is the object that encodes the geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos.


For any X∈HX \in \mathbf{H} the ∞\infty-groupoid Π(X)\Pi(X) coincides with the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos (see there) of the over-(∞,1)-topos H/X\mathbf{H}/X.


The fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid Π ∞(X)\Pi_\infty(X) of a topological space XX is the ∞-groupoid whose k-morphisms are the kk-dimensional paths in XX. This is the higher refinement of the fundamental groupoid Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X).
It is also sometimes called the ∞\infty-Poincaré groupoid of the space, in analogy to the term Poincaré groupoid for the fundamental groupoid.
General version
The following definition is appropriate if we take a Kan complex as the definition of ∞\infty-groupoid.

Definition
The fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid Π(X)\Pi(X) of a topological space XX is given by the Kan complex
SingX:[k]↦Hom Top(Δ k,X)
  Sing X : [k] \mapsto Hom_{Top}(\Delta^k, X)


which is the singular simplicial complex of XX.


Remark
This construction is right adjoint to geometric realization.


Remark
By choosing horn-fillers this becomes an algebraic Kan complex. In terms of these the homotopy hypothesis has a direct proof, exhibited by a Quillen equivalence
AlgKan→←ΠTop
  Alg Kan \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\leftarrow}}{\to} Top


due to (Nikolaus).


Remark
One may regard the singular simplicial complex functor as the instance of the general abstract notion of fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos by regarding Top as a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. See discrete ∞-groupoid for more on this.

For other models of ∞Grpd there are correspondingly other constructions:

The definition of Trimble n-category has the concept of fundamental nn-groupoid built right into it.

Strict versions
One can consider strict ∞-groupoid versions of the fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid. These lose information about the homotopy type of the space, though, but are more tractable and may give in some applications all the information that one is interested in.
The study of strict fundamental ∞\infty-groupoids have been pursued by Ronnie Brown and his school.
There is a strict homotopy 2-groupoid for a Hausdorff space defined spring , and a weak homotopy 2-groupoid for a general space (by the same authors). They later introduced a homotopy double groupoid. There is no nn-dimensional version of these ideas on offer.
A strict cubical omega-groupoid ρX *\rho X_* for a filtered space X *X_* was defined by Brown and Higgins in 1981. Form the filtered cubical complex RX *R X_* which in dimension nn consists of filtered maps I * n→X *I^n_* \to X_* and take filter homotopy classes of these relative to the vertices. The proof that the compositions in RX *RX_* are inherited by ρX *\rho X_* is one of the key points of the development.
It turns out that ρX *\rho X_* is equivalent in a clear sense to the crossed complex ΠX *\Pi X_* defined using relative homotopy groups by Blakers in 1948 (with other terminology) and that the homotopy types modelled by crossed complexes, or by the corresponding globular or cubical gadget, are restricted, essentially to the linear homotopy types, with no quadratic information. Nonetheless, it is well known in mathematics that linear approximations can be useful.
Loday’s paper of 1982 on Spaces with finitely many homotopy groups introduced the entirely new idea of a cubical resolution of a space. Some details were completed by Richard Steiner. Loday also introduced the fundamental cat-n-group of an nn-cube of spaces. In this way we get a model of a space XX by a multiple groupoid in which the rr-dimensional homotopy of XX occurs in the right place in the model. Also you can calculate something with this model, and it has led to new algebraic constructions, such as a nonabelian tensor product of groups, with homotopical applications.
These strict groupoid models do satisfy the dimension condition.

Proposition
The 1-truncation of ΠX\Pi X is the fundamental groupoid of XX:
τ ≤1ΠX≃Π 1(X).
  \tau_{\leq 1} \Pi X \simeq \Pi_1(X)
  \,.



Proposition
For XX a locally contractible topological space, the fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid SingXSing X is equivalent to the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos of the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos (∞,1)Sh(X)(\infty,1)Sh(X).


Proof
Details on this are at geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos.


Remark
This perspective suggests that when XX is not locally contractible, a better replacement for its fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid (as usually defined) is the shape of (∞,1)Sh(X)(\infty,1)Sh(X). As discussed there, this coincides with the traditional shape theory of XX.

Given an adjunction
(L⊣R):X⇄RLY
  (L \dashv R)
  \colon\;
  X
    \underoverset{R}{L}{\rightleftarrows}
  Y


there is a natural transformation (or more generally, a 22-morphism) η:id X→R∘L\eta\colon id_X \to R \circ L, called the unit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “front adjunction”). (A reason for the name is that R∘LR \circ L is a monad, which is a kind of monoid object, and η\eta is the identity of this monoid. Since ‘identity’ in this context would suggest an identity natural transformation, we use the synonym ‘unit’.)
Similarly, there is a 22-morphism ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon\colon L \circ R \to id_Y, called the counit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “back adjunction” or “end adjunction”). (This is the co-identity of the comonad L∘RL \circ R.)
General
Unit and counit of an adjunction satisfy the triangle identities.
An adjunct is given by precomposition with a unit or postcomposition with a counit.
The left adjoint L:X→YL : X \to Y is fully faithful (i.e. a coreflection) if and only if the unit η:id X→R∘L\eta : id_X \to R \circ L is a natural isomorphism (if and only if id X≅R∘Lid_X \cong R \circ L by Lemma A1.1.1 of the Elephant). Dually, the right adjoint R:Y→XR : Y \to X is fully faithful (i.e. a reflection) if and only if the counit ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon : L \circ R \to id_Y is a natural isomorphism. (See this Prop. at adjoint functor.)
If the unit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lari (“left adjoint right inverse”); whilst RR is termed rali (“right adjoint left inverse”). Dually, if the counit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lali (“left adjoint left inverse”); whilst RR is termed rari (“right adjoint right inverse”). All four classes of functor are closed under composition, and contain the equivalences.
Relation to monads
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) gives rise to a monad T≔R∘LT \coloneqq R \circ L. The unit of this monad id→Tid \to T is the unit of the adjunction, id→R∘Lid \to R \circ L.
A monad is a structure that is a lot like a monoid, but that lives in a bicategory rather than a monoidal category. In other words, the concept of a monad is a vertical categorification of that of a monoid.

The bicategory of monads
Given the equivalence between monads in KK and lax functors 1→K1 \to K it is straightforward to define the bicategory Mnd(K)Mnd(K) of monads in KK to be the lax functor category [1,K] ℓ[1,K]_\ell, which consists of lax functors, lax transformations and modifications.
Spelling this out, we see that an object of Mnd(K)Mnd(K) is a monad (a,t,η,μ)(a,t,\eta,\mu) in KK. A morphism of monads (a,t)→(b,s)(a,t) \to (b,s) is given by 1-cell x:a→bx \colon a \to b together with a 2-cell λ:sx→xt\lambda \colon s x \to x t satisfying
x →η sx sx xη t↓  ↓λ xt →1 xtssx →sλ sxt →λt xtt μ sx↓    ↓xμ t sx  →λ  xt
\array{
  x & \stackrel{\eta^s x}{\to} & s x \\
  \mathllap{x \eta^t} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\lambda} \\
  x t & \stackrel{1}{\to} & x t
}\qquad \qquad
\array{
 s s x & \stackrel{s \lambda}{\to} & s x t & \stackrel{\lambda t}{\to}
 & x t t \\
 \mathllap{\mu^s x} \downarrow & & & & \downarrow \mathrlap{x \mu^t}
 \\
 s x & & \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} & & x t
}


Finally, a 2-cell (x,λ)⇒(y,κ)(x,\lambda) \Rightarrow (y, \kappa) is given by a 2-cell m:x⇒ym \colon x \Rightarrow y satisfying
sx →sm sy λ↓  ↓κ xt →mt yt
\array{
 s x & \stackrel{s m}{\to} & s y \\
 \mathllap{\lambda} \downarrow & & \downarrow \mathrlap{\kappa} \\
 x t & \stackrel{m t}{\to} & y t
}


Algebras/modules over a monad
Given that a monad in a bicategory ℬ\mathcal{B} is nothing but a monoid object in a hom-category ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a), it is natural to consider a module over this monoid: a module for a monad. This notion of module is more general than a module in a monoidal category, however, since it need not live in ℬ(a,a)\mathcal{B}(a,a) but can be in ℬ(b,a)\mathcal{B}(b,a) (for left modules) or ℬ(a,c)\mathcal{B}(a,c) (for right modules).
In a Cat-like bicategory, left modules over a monad are usually known as algebras over the monad. This terminology is confusing from the point of view of monads as monoids, but is justified because in Cat itself, such algebras with domain 1 are just algebras for a monad in the classical sense. Such algebras are a powerful tool to encode general algebraic structures; this is the topic of universal algebra. The algebras over a monad form its Eilenberg-Moore category, which is characterized by a universal property.
Some monads arise from operads, in which case algebras for the monad are the same as algebras for the operad. A Lawvere theory is another special sort of monad in CatCat.
Relation to adjunctions and monadicity
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) induces a monad R∘LR \circ L and a comonad L∘RL \circ R. There is in general more than one adjunction which gives rise to a given monad this way, in fact there is a category of adjunctions for a given monad. An adjunction inducing a monad TT is called a resolution of TT. The initial object in that category is the adjunction over the Kleisli category of the monad and the terminal object is that over the Eilenberg-Moore category of algebras. (e.g. Borceux, vol. 2, prop. 4.2.2) The latter is called the monadic adjunction.
Moreover, passing from adjunctions to monads and back to their monadic adjunctions constitutes itself an adjunction between adjunctions and monads, called the semantics-structure adjunction.
A topos may be thought of as a generalized topological space. Accordingly, the notions of


locally connected space


locally simply connected space


locally 22-connected space


locally nn-connected space


locally contractible space


have analogs for toposes, (n,1)-toposes and (∞,1)-toposes


locally connected topos


locally simply connected (2,1)-topos?


locally nn-connected (n+1,1)(n+1,1)-topos


locally ∞\infty-connected (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos


The numbering mismatch is traditional from topology; see n-connected space. It reads a bit better if we say locally nn-simply connected for locally nn-connected, since locally 11-(simply) connected is locally simply connected, but being locally nn-simply connected is still a property of an (n+1,1)(n+1,1)-topos.
The fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid Π ∞(X)\Pi_\infty(X) of a topological space XX is the ∞-groupoid whose k-morphisms are the kk-dimensional paths in XX. This is the higher refinement of the fundamental groupoid Π 1(X)\Pi_1(X).
It is also sometimes called the ∞\infty-Poincaré groupoid of the space, in analogy to the term Poincaré groupoid for the fundamental groupoid.
General version
The following definition is appropriate if we take a Kan complex as the definition of ∞\infty-groupoid.

Definition
The fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid Π(X)\Pi(X) of a topological space XX is given by the Kan complex
SingX:[k]↦Hom Top(Δ k,X)
  Sing X : [k] \mapsto Hom_{Top}(\Delta^k, X)


which is the singular simplicial complex of XX.


Remark
This construction is right adjoint to geometric realization.


Remark
By choosing horn-fillers this becomes an algebraic Kan complex. In terms of these the homotopy hypothesis has a direct proof, exhibited by a Quillen equivalence
AlgKan→←ΠTop
  Alg Kan \stackrel{\overset{\Pi}{\leftarrow}}{\to} Top


due to (Nikolaus).


Remark
One may regard the singular simplicial complex functor as the instance of the general abstract notion of fundamental ∞-groupoid in a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos by regarding Top as a cohesive (∞,1)-topos. See discrete ∞-groupoid for more on this.

For other models of ∞Grpd there are correspondingly other constructions:

The definition of Trimble n-category has the concept of fundamental nn-groupoid built right into it.

Strict versions
One can consider strict ∞-groupoid versions of the fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid. These lose information about the homotopy type of the space, though, but are more tractable and may give in some applications all the information that one is interested in.
The study of strict fundamental ∞\infty-groupoids have been pursued by Ronnie Brown and his school.
There is a strict homotopy 2-groupoid for a Hausdorff space defined spring , and a weak homotopy 2-groupoid for a general space (by the same authors). They later introduced a homotopy double groupoid. There is no nn-dimensional version of these ideas on offer.
A strict cubical omega-groupoid ρX *\rho X_* for a filtered space X *X_* was defined by Brown and Higgins in 1981. Form the filtered cubical complex RX *R X_* which in dimension nn consists of filtered maps I * n→X *I^n_* \to X_* and take filter homotopy classes of these relative to the vertices. The proof that the compositions in RX *RX_* are inherited by ρX *\rho X_* is one of the key points of the development.
It turns out that ρX *\rho X_* is equivalent in a clear sense to the crossed complex ΠX *\Pi X_* defined using relative homotopy groups by Blakers in 1948 (with other terminology) and that the homotopy types modelled by crossed complexes, or by the corresponding globular or cubical gadget, are restricted, essentially to the linear homotopy types, with no quadratic information. Nonetheless, it is well known in mathematics that linear approximations can be useful.
Loday’s paper of 1982 on Spaces with finitely many homotopy groups introduced the entirely new idea of a cubical resolution of a space. Some details were completed by Richard Steiner. Loday also introduced the fundamental cat-n-group of an nn-cube of spaces. In this way we get a model of a space XX by a multiple groupoid in which the rr-dimensional homotopy of XX occurs in the right place in the model. Also you can calculate something with this model, and it has led to new algebraic constructions, such as a nonabelian tensor product of groups, with homotopical applications.
These strict groupoid models do satisfy the dimension condition.

Proposition
The 1-truncation of ΠX\Pi X is the fundamental groupoid of XX:
τ ≤1ΠX≃Π 1(X).
  \tau_{\leq 1} \Pi X \simeq \Pi_1(X)
  \,.



Proposition
For XX a locally contractible topological space, the fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid SingXSing X is equivalent to the fundamental ∞-groupoid of a locally ∞-connected (∞,1)-topos of the (∞,1)-sheaf (∞,1)-topos (∞,1)Sh(X)(\infty,1)Sh(X).


Proof
Details on this are at geometric homotopy groups in an (∞,1)-topos.


Remark
This perspective suggests that when XX is not locally contractible, a better replacement for its fundamental ∞\infty-groupoid (as usually defined) is the shape of (∞,1)Sh(X)(\infty,1)Sh(X). As discussed there, this coincides with the traditional shape theory of XX.

A discrete space is, in general, an object of a concrete category SpSp of spaces that is free on its own underlying set. More generally, the notion can be applied relative to any forgetful functor.
Note: This page is about the “cohesive” or “topological” notion of discreteness. In 2-category theory the term “discrete object” is also often used for 0-truncated objects. For this usage, see discrete morphism instead.
A discrete space must, in particular, be a free object for the forgetful functor U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp\to Set, i.e. in the image of its left adjoint F:Set→SpF: Set \to Sp. However, this is not sufficient for it to be free on its own underlying set; we must also require that the counit FUX→XF U X\to X be an isomorphism.
Thus, we say that U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp \to Set (or more generally, any functor) has discrete spaces or discrete objects if it has a fully faithful left adjoint. This ensures that the functor
Set→FSp→USet Set \stackrel{F}\to Sp \stackrel{U}\to Set 
is (naturally isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set. This is true, for example, if SpSp is Top, Diff, Loc, etc.
Assuming that UU is faithful (as it is when SpSp is a concrete category), we can characterise a discrete space XX as one such that every function from XX to YY (for YY any space) is a morphism of spaces. (More precisely, this means that every function from U(X)U(X) to U(Y)U(Y) is the image under UU of a morphism from XX to YY.)
The dual notion is a codiscrete object.
A comonad (or cotriple) on a category AA is a comonoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors A→AA \to A. More generally, a comonad in a 2-category EE is a comonoid in the monoidal category E(X,X)E(X,X) for some object X∈KX\in K.
Just as a monad may be defined for any 2-category, EE, as a lax 2-functor from 1\mathbf{1} to EE, so a comonad in EE is an oplax 2-functor from 1→E\mathbf{1} \to E.
See at monad for more.
Coalgebras
A coalgebra over a comonad (or comodule) over a comonad CC on a category AA is an object a∈Aa\in A with a map a→Caa\to C a satisfying dual axioms to those for an algebra over a monad. The category of coalgebras is called its (co-)Eilenberg-Moore category and satisfies a universal property dual to that of the Eilenberg-Moore object for a monad; it can thereby be internalized to any 2-category. The forgetful functor from the category of coalgebras to the category AA is called a comonadic functor. Similarly, a comonad also has a co-Kleisli category.
Comonadic homology and descent
Any comonad on AA induces an augmented simplicial endofunctor of AA consisting of its iterates. If AA is an abelian category and the comonad is additive, then this is the basis of comonadic homology?. Comodules (= coalgebras) over the comonad with underlying endofunctor M R↦M R⊗ RSM_R\mapsto M_R\otimes_R S in RR-ModMod for the extension of rings R↪SR\hookrightarrow S correspond to the descent data for that extension. Gluing of categories from localizations may also be formalized via comonads.
Mixed distributive laws
Distributive laws between a monad and a comonad are so-called mixed distributive laws; a special case has been rediscovered in physics under the name entwining structures (Brzeziński, Majid 1997). Their theory is often studied in the connection with the theory of comonads in the bicategory of rings, modules and morphisms of modules, that is corings. There is a homomorphism of bicategories from a bicategory of entwinings to a bicategory of corings (Škoda 2008), which is an analogue of the 2-functor compcomp (R. Street, Formal theory of monads, JPAA 1972) of strict 2-categories in the case of distributive laws of monads (recall also that a distributive law among monads corresponds to a monad in the 2-category of monads).
The analog in the context of (∞,1)-topos theory of a local geometric morphism in topos theory.

Definition
A local (∞,1)-geometric morphism f:H→Sf : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{S} between (∞,1)-toposes H,S\mathbf{H},\mathbf{S} is


an (∞,1)-geometric morphism
(f *⊣f *):H→f *←f *S
  (f^* \dashv f_*) 
   : 
    \mathbf{H} \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
  {\to}}  \mathbf{S}



such that


a further right adjoint f !:S→Hf^! : \mathbf{S} \to \mathbf{H} to the direct image functor exists:
(f *⊣f *⊣f !):H←f !→f *←f *S
  (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
  \mathbf{H}
   \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}
   {\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\to}}{\underset{f^!}{\leftarrow}}}
  \mathbf{S}  



and ff is a ∞-connected (∞,1)-geometric morphism.




If f:H→Sf : \mathbf{H} \to \mathbf{S} is the global section (∞,1)-geometric morphism in the over-(∞,1)-category Topos/S/\mathbf{S}, then we say that H\mathbf{H} is a local (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos over S\mathbf{S}.


Remark
If S=\mathbf{S} =  ∞Grpd then the extra condition that ff is ∞-connected (∞,1)-geometric morphism is automatic (see Properties – over ∞Grpd).

Local geometric morphism and relative local topos

Definition
A local geometric morphism f:E→Sf : E \to S between toposes E,SE,S is


a geometric morphism
(f *⊣f *):E→f *←f *S
 (f^* \dashv f_*) \colon E \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{f_*}
 {\to}}  S



such that a further right adjoint f !:S→Ef^! : S \to E exists
(f *⊣f *⊣f !):E⟵f !⟶f *⟵f *S
 (f^* \dashv f_* \dashv f^!) : 
 E
 \stackrel{\overset{f^*}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{f_*}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{f^!}{\longleftarrow}}}
 S



and such that one, hence all, of the following equivalent conditions hold:

The right adjoint f !f^! is an SS-indexed functor.
ff is connected, i.e. f *f^* is fully faithful.
The right adjoint f !f^! is fully faithful.
The right adjoint f !f^! is cartesian closed.




When we regard EE as a topos over SS, so that ff is regarded as its global section geometric morphism in the category of toposes over SS, then we say that EE is a local SS-topos. In this case we may label the functors involved as
(Disc⊣Γ⊣Codisc):E⟵Codisc⟶Γ⟵DiscS
  (Disc \dashv \Gamma \dashv Codisc) : 
    E
    \stackrel{\overset{Disc}{\longleftarrow}}{\stackrel{\underset{\Gamma}{\longrightarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\longleftarrow}}}
    S


to indicate that if we think of Γ\Gamma as sending a space to its underlying SS-object of points by forgetting cohesion, then DiscDisc creates the discrete space/discrete object and CodiscCodisc the codiscrete space/codiscrete object on an object in SS.
This is especially common when S=S= Set, in which case the final condition is automatic since all functors are SetSet-indexed. Hence in that case we have the following simpler definition.
Local topos

Definition
A sheaf topos 𝒯\mathcal{T} is a local topos if the global section geometric morphism 𝒯→Γ←LConstSet\mathcal{T} \stackrel{\overset{LConst}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{\Gamma}{\to}} Set has a further right adjoint CoDiscCoDisc, making an adjoint triple (LConst⊣Γ⊣CoDisc)(LConst \dashv \Gamma \dashv CoDisc)
CoDisc:Set↪𝒯.
  CoDisc \colon Set \hookrightarrow \mathcal{T}. 


(As just stated, it is automatic in the case over SetSet that this is furthermore a full and faithful functor.)


Remark
Another way of stating this is that a Grothendieck topos is local if and only if the terminal object 11 is connected and projective (since this means precisely that Γ=hom(1,−)\Gamma = \hom(1, -) preserves colimits, and therefore has a right adjoint by virtue of an adjoint functor theorem). Another term for this: we say 11 is tiny (atomic). Notice the similarity to the concept of amazing right adjoint (the difference being that this is a right adjoint not to the external but to the internal hom out of 1.)

Note also that in an infinitary-extensive category an object is connected as soon as hom(X,−)\hom(X,-) preserves binary coproducts (see connected object). Moreover, a coproduct-preserving functor between toposes preserves coequalizers as soon as it preserves epimorphisms, since any coequalizer can be constructed as the quotient of an equivalence relation generated using images and countable coproducts and quotients of equivalence relations are effective. Thus, we can say that a Grothendieck topos is local iff hom(1,−)\hom(1,-) preserves binary coproducts and epis. Moreover, a cospan A→C←BA \to C \leftarrow B in a topos is a coproduct diagram iff AA and BB are disjoint monos whose union is all of CC; thus hom(1,−)\hom(1,-) preserves binary coproducts as soon as it preserves the initial object and binary unions. This leads to the following equivalent form of “locality” that makes sense even for elementary toposes:

Definition
An elementary topos EE is local if the terminal object 11 is


nonempty: 1≇01\ncong 0,


connected: 1=p∨q1 = p \vee q implies 1=p1 = p or 1=q1 = q, and


projective: every epi U→1U \to 1 admits a section t:1→Ut: 1 \to U.




Remark
Some authors have instead used the term “local” to refer just to the condition that 11 is connected; note this is equivalent to Sub E(1)Sub_E(1) being a local rig. In his thesis, Steve Awodey upgraded this, saying that a topos is hyperlocal if both connectivity and projectivity are satisfied. As argued above, for a Grothendieck topos this is slightly weaker than locality, although the difference is only in the inclusion of the trivial topos (for if 1≅01\cong 0 then E≃1E\simeq 1). Note that a local elementary topos, as defined above, is constructively well-pointed if and only if 11 is additionally a generator.


Example
The free topos is a local elementary topos.

Equivalent characterizations

Proposition
A geometric morphism f:E→Sf : E \to S is local precisely if


there exists a geometric morphism c:S→Ec : S \to E such that f∘c≃idf \circ c \simeq id;


for every other geometric morphism g:G→Sg : G \to S the composite c∘gc\circ g is an initial object in the hom-category Topos /S(g,f)Topos_{/S}(g,f) of the slice 2-category of Topos over SS.



This is (Johnstone, theorem 3.6.1 vi)).

Remark
In particular this means that the category of topos points of a local topos has a contractible nerve.

General

Proposition
The global section geometric morphism of any local 𝒮\mathcal{S}-topos (over a base topos 𝒮\mathcal{S}) is a Grothendieck fibration and a Grothendieck opfibration.

This appears in (Shulman).

Proposition
The Freyd cover of a topos is a local topos, and in fact freely so. Every local topos is a retract of a Freyd cover.

This appears as (Johnstone, lemma C3.6.4).
Homotopy dimension

Proposition
In a local sheaf topos over Set, every inhabited object is globally inhabited:
every object XX for which the unique morphism X→*X \to * to the terminal object is an epimorphism has a global point *→X* \to X.


Proof
Since in a local topos the global section functor Γ\Gamma is a left adjoint, it preserves epimorphisms. Since it is a right adjoint it preserves the terminal object. Therefore Γ(X)→Γ(*)≃*\Gamma(X) \to \Gamma(*) \simeq * is an epimorphism in Set, hence a surjection, meaning that Γ(X)\Gamma(X) is inhabited. Since Γ(X)≃Hom(*,X)\Gamma(X) \simeq Hom(*,X) (see global section geometric morphism), the claim follows.


Remark
In a topos every epimorphism is an effective epimorphism. Therefore X→*X \to * being an epi means that XX is a (-1)-connected object. Therefore the above statement says in terms of (infinity,1)-category theory that a non-trivial local topos has homotopy dimension 0.
The same is true for any local (infinity,1)-topos.

Concrete sheaves
Every local topos Γ:E→S\Gamma : E \to S comes with a notion of concrete sheaves, a reflective subcategory Conc Γ(E)↪EConc_\Gamma(E) \hookrightarrow E which factors the topos inclusion of SS:
S↪Codisc←ΓConc Γ(E)↪←ConcE
  S 
   \stackrel{\overset{\Gamma}{\leftarrow}}{\underset{Codisc}{\hookrightarrow}}
  Conc_\Gamma(E) 
    \stackrel{\overset{Conc}{\leftarrow}}{\hookrightarrow}
  E


and is a quasitopos. See concrete sheaf for details.
Homotopy equivalence
Since a local geometric morphism has a left adjoint in the 2-category Topos, it is necessarily a homotopy equivalence of toposes.


free cocompletion


Yoneda extension


A stack AA is called a moduli stack for certain structures, if for any other object XX the groupoid of morphisms X→AX \to A into AA is equivalent to the groupoid of these kinds of structures on XX.
This is in contrast to the notion of moduli space, which is only about equivalence classes of structures and loses the information about the gauge equivalences/ automorphism groups of these structures.
There is an evident generalization of the concept of moduli stacks in the more general context of higher topos theory, to moduli ∞-stacks.
Notice that every stack is the moduli stack of something and in fact in general of different things at the same time (see below). So to some extent saying “moduli stack” is redundant. It is usually used to indicate, roughly, that there are some spaces/stacks that one is working on/over, and then there are apart from this stacks, the moduli stacks, that one is mapping into.
This distinction however easily disappears. For instance a historically famous moduli stack is the moduli stack of elliptic curves which started out as an object used to classify bundles of elliptic curves over other spaces. Later in the study of elliptic cohomology and tmf the “moduli stack” of elliptic curves came to be regarded as a space interesting in itself for the geometry on it, specifically since this is naturally a derived algebraic geometry.
Analogous comments apply to other moduli stacks. For instance for GG a topological group, the moduli stack BG≃*//G\mathbf{B}G \simeq \ast //G for topological GG-principal bundles is itself interesting for its own geometry. Notably it is the base stack of the universal principal bundle which as such may be equipped with differential geometry such as a connection on a bundle etc.
Generally, what one needs for a stack to classify bundles in this way is a universal bundle over it, for then what the stack modulates are precisely the pullbacks of this universal bundle. A stack with a prescribed universal bundle over it may be regarded as a stack equipped with an atlas.
In conclusion then “moduli stack” pretty much means “stack” or more precisely “stack with specified universal bundle over it or atlas into it”, with the implicit implication that we say “moduli stack” to indicate that we care about pulling back that atlas/bundle along maps into the stack.
(Compare this to how one says “presheaf” for what is really just a functor in order to indicate a certain attitude, namely that one will be interested in asking which presheaves are sheaves.)
In every cohesive (∞,1)-topos there is an intrinsic notion of ∞-Chern-Weil theory that gives rise to a notion of connection on principal ∞-bundles. We describe here details of the realization of this general abstract structure in the cohesive (∞,1)(\infty,1)-topos Smooth∞Grpd of smooth ∞-groupoids.
For GG an ∞-Lie group, a connection on a smooth GG-principal ∞-bundle is a structure that supports the Chern-Weil homomorphism in Smooth∞Grpd: it interpolates between the nonabelian cohomology class c∈H smooth 1(X,G)c \in H^1_{smooth}(X,G) of the bundle and the refinements to ordinary differential cohomology of its characteristic classes: the curvature characteristic classes.
This generalizes the notion of connection on a bundle and the ordinary Chern-Weil homomorphism in differential geometry.
See the Motivation section at Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd and the page ∞-Chern-Weil theory introduction for more background.
For braided ∞\infty-groups
Let H\mathbf{H} be a cohesive (∞,1)-topos equippd with differential cohesion and let 𝔾∈Grp(H)\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H}) be a braided ∞-group. Write
curv 𝔾=θ B𝔾:B𝔾→♭ dRB 2𝔾
  curv_{\mathbb{G}} = \theta_{\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}}
  \;\colon\;
  \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}
  \to 
  \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}


for the Maurer-Cartan form on the delooping ∞-group B𝔾∈Grp(H)\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G} \in Grp(\mathbf{H}).
Let
Ω(−,𝔾)→♭ dRB 2𝔾
  \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})
  \to
  \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}


be the morphism out of a 0-truncated object which is universal with the property that for Σ∈H\Sigma \in \mathbf{H} any manifold, the induced internal hom map
[Σ,Ω(−,𝔾)]→[Σ,♭ dRB 2𝔾]
  [\Sigma, \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})]
  \to
  [\Sigma, \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}]


is a 1-epimorphism.
Then write B𝔾 conn\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} for the (∞,1)-pullback in
B𝔾 conn → Ω(−,𝔾) ↓  ↓ B𝔾 →curv 𝔾 ♭ dRB 2𝔾.
  \array{
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn}
    &\to&
    \Omega(-,\mathbb{G})
    \\
    \downarrow
    &&
    \downarrow
    \\
    \mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}
    &\stackrel{curv_{\mathbb{G}}}{\to}&
    \flat_{dR}\mathbf{B}^2 \mathbb{G}
  }
  \,.


We say that B𝔾 conn\mathbf{B}\mathbb{G}_{conn} is the moduli ∞-stack of 𝔾\mathbb{G}-principal ∞\infty-connections.
For instance for 𝔾=B n−1U(1)\mathbb{G} = \mathbf{B}^{n-1}U(1) the circle n-group the moduli nn-stack B nU(1) conn\mathbf{B}^n U(1)_{conn} is presented by the Deligne complex for ordinary differential cohomology in degree (n+1)(n+1), hence is the moduli nn-stack for circle n-bundles with connection.
For ∞\infty-groups obtained by Lie integration
We assume that the reader is familiar with the notation and constructions discussed at Smooth∞Grpd. The following definition may be understood as a direct generalization of the description of ordinary GG-connections as cocycles in the stack BG conn\mathbf{B}G_{conn} as discussed at connection on a bundle, in view of the characterization of Weil algebra in the smooth infinity-topos

We discuss now connections on those GG-principal ∞-bundles for which G∈G \in  Smooth∞Grpd is an smooth ∞-group that arises from Lie integration of an L-∞ algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g}.
Let 𝔤∈L ∞↪CE\mathfrak{g} \in L_\infty \stackrel{CE}{\hookrightarrow}  dgAlg op{}^{op} be an L-∞ algebra over the real numbers and of finite type with Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra CE(𝔤)CE(\mathfrak{g}) and Weil algebra W(𝔤)W(\mathfrak{g}).
For XX a smooth manifold, write Ω •(X)∈dgAlg\Omega^\bullet(X) \in dgAlg for the de Rham complex of smooth differential forms. For k∈ℕk \in \mathbb{N} let Δ k\Delta^k be the standard kk-simplex regarded as a smooth manifold with corners in the standard way. Write Ω si •(X×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet_{si}(X \times \Delta^k) for the sub-dg-algebra of differential forms with sitting instants perpendicular to the boundary of the simplex, and Ω si,vert •(X×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(X\times \Delta^k) for the further sub-dg-algebra of vertical differential forms with respect to the canonical projection X×Δ k→XX \times \Delta^k \to X.

Definition
A morphism
Ω •(X)←W(𝔤):A
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \leftarrow
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  : 
  A


in dgAlg we call an L-∞ algebra valued differential form with values in 𝔤\mathfrak{g}, dually a morphism of ∞-Lie algebroids
A:TX→inn(𝔤)
  A : T X \to inn(\mathfrak{g})


from the tangent Lie algebroid to the inner automorphism ∞-Lie algebra.
Its curvature is the composite of morphisms of graded vector spaces
Ω •(X)←AW(𝔤)←F (−)𝔤 *[2]:F A
  \Omega^\bullet(X) \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{F_{(-)}}{\leftarrow}
  \mathfrak{g}^*[2]
  : 
  F_{A}


that injects the shifted generators into the Weil algebra.
Precisely if the curvatures vanish does the morphism factor through the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra
(F A=0)⇔(  CE(𝔤)   ∃A flat↙ ↑ Ω •(X) ←A W(𝔤))
  (F_A = 0) 
  \;\;\Leftrightarrow
  \;\;
  \left(
  \array{
     && CE(\mathfrak{g})
     \\
     & {}^{\mathllap{\exists A_{flat}}}\swarrow & \uparrow
     \\
     \Omega^\bullet(X) &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}& W(\mathfrak{g})     
  }
  \right)


in which case we call AA flat.
The curvature characteristic forms of AA are the composite
Ω •(X)←AW(𝔤)←⟨F (−)⟩inv(𝔤):⟨F A⟩,
  \Omega^\bullet(X)
  \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
  W(\mathfrak{g})
  \stackrel{\langle F_{(-)} \rangle}{\leftarrow}
  inv(\mathfrak{g})
  :
  \langle F_A\rangle
  \,,


where inv(𝔤)→W(𝔤)inv(\mathfrak{g}) \to W(\mathfrak{g}) is the inclusion of the invariant polynomials.

We define now simplicial presheaves over the site CartSp smooth↪{}_{smooth} \hookrightarrow  SmoothMfd of Cartesian spaces and smooth functions between them.

Definition
Write exp(𝔤)∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]\exp(\mathfrak{g}) \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] for the simplicial presheaf given by
exp(𝔤):(U,[k])↦{Ω si,vert •(U×Δ k)←A vertCE(𝔤)}
  \exp(\mathfrak{g}) : 
  (U,[k])
  \mapsto
  \left\{
    \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times\Delta^k)
     \stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}
    CE(\mathfrak{g})
  \right\}


(the untruncated Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g}).
Write exp(𝔤) diff∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] for the simplicial presheaf given by
exp(𝔤) diff:(U,[k])↦{Ω si,vert •(U×Δ k) ←A vert CE(𝔤) ↑  ↑ Ω si •(U×Δ k) ←A W(𝔤)}.
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} :
  (U,[k])
  \mapsto
  \left\{
     \array{
      \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times\Delta^k)
       &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
      CE(\mathfrak{g})
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)
      &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
      W(\mathfrak{g})
    }
  \right\}
  \,.


Write exp(𝔤) ChW∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] for the simplicial presheaf given by
exp(𝔤) ChW:(U,[k])↦{Ω si,vert •(U×Δ k) ←A vert CE(𝔤) ↑  ↑ Ω si •(U×Δ k) ←A W(𝔤) ↑  ↑ Ω •(U) ←⟨F A⟩ inv(𝔤)}.
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW}
  :
  (U,[k])
  \mapsto
  \left\{
     \array{
      \Omega^\bullet_{si,vert}(U \times\Delta^k)
       &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
      CE(\mathfrak{g})
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)

      W(\mathfrak{g})
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      \Omega^\bullet(U)
      &\stackrel{\langle F_A\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
      inv(\mathfrak{g})
    }
  \right\}
  \,.


Define the simplicial presheaf exp(𝔤) conn\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} by
exp(𝔤) conn(U):[k]↦{Ω si •(U×Δ k)←AW(𝔤)|∀v∈Γ(TΔ k):ι vF A=0}
  \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}(U)
  :
  [k]
  \mapsto
  \left\{
     \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k)
      \stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}
     W(\mathfrak{g})
     \;\;
     |
     \;\;
       \forall v \in \Gamma(T \Delta^k) : \iota_v F_A = 0
  \right\}


Here on the right we have in each case the sets of horizontal morphisms in dgAlg that make commuting diagrams in dgAlg as indicated, with the vertical morphisms being the canonical projections and inclusions. The functoriality in f:K→Uf : K \to U and ρ:[k]→[l]\rho : [k] \to [l] is by the evident precomposition with the pullback of differential forms Ω •(U×Δ k)→(f,id) *Ω •(K×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k) \stackrel{(f,id)^*}{\to} \Omega^\bullet(K \times \Delta^k) and Ω •(U×Δ l)←(id,ρ) *Ω •(U,×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^l) \stackrel{(id,\rho)^*}{\leftarrow} \Omega^\bullet(U, \times \Delta^k).

Proposition
There are canonical morphisms in [CartSp smooth op,sSet][CartSp_{smooth}^{op},sSet] between these objects
exp(𝔤) conn ↪ exp(𝔤) ChW ↪ exp(𝔤) diff     ↓     exp(𝔤),
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}
    &\hookrightarrow&
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW}
    &\hookrightarrow&
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}
    \\
    && && \downarrow
    \\
    && && \exp(\mathfrak{g})
  }
  \,,


where the horizontal morphisms are monomorphisms of simplicial presheaves and the vertical morphism is over each U∈CartSpU \in CartSp an equivalence of Kan complexes (it is a weak equivalence between fibrant objects in the projective model structure on simplicial presheaves).


Proof
The inclusion exp(𝔤) ChW↪exp(𝔤) dff\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} \hookrightarrow \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{dff} is clear. The weak equivalence exp(𝔤) diff→exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} \to \exp(\mathfrak{g}) is discussed at Smooth∞Grpd (but is also directly verified).
To see the inclusion exp(𝔤) conn↪exp(𝔤) ChW\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} \hookrightarrow \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} we need to check that the horizonality condition ι vF A=0\iota_v F_A = 0 on the curvature of a 𝔤\mathfrak{g}-valued form AA for all vector fields vv tangent to the simplex implies that all the curvature characteristic forms ⟨F A⟩\langle F_A\rangle are basic forms that “descend to UU”, hence that are in the image of the inclusion Ω •(U)→Ω si •(U×Δ k)\Omega^\bullet(U) \to \Omega^\bullet_{si}(U \times \Delta^k).
For this it is sufficient to show that for all v∈Γ(TΔ k)v \in \Gamma(T \Delta^k) we have


ι v⟨F A⟩=0\iota_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0;


ℒ v⟨F A⟩=0\mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 0


where in the second line we have the Lie derivative ℒ v\mathcal{L}_v along vv.
The first condition is evidently satisfied if already ι vF A=0\iota_v F_A = 0. The second condition follows with Cartan calculus and using that d dR⟨F A⟩=0d_{dR} \langle F_A\rangle = 0 (which holds as a consequence of the definition of invariant polynomial):
ℒ v⟨F A⟩=dι v⟨F A⟩+ι vd⟨F A⟩=0.
  \mathcal{L}_v \langle F_A \rangle = 
  d \iota_v \langle F_A \rangle
  + 
  \iota_v d \langle F_A \rangle
  = 0
  \,.



Remark
For a general L-∞ algebra 𝔤\mathfrak{g} the curvature forms F AF_A themselves are not necessarily closed (rather they satisfy the Bianchi identity), hence requiring them to have no component along the simplex does not imply that they descend. This is different for abelian L-∞ algebras: for them the curvature forms themselves are already closed, and hence are themselves already curvature characteristics that do descent.

For n∈ℕn \in \mathbb{N} let cosk n+1:sSet→sSet\mathbf{cosk}_{n+1} : sSet \to sSet be the simplicial coskeleton functor. Its prolongation to simplicial presheaves we denote here τ n\tau_n and write
τ nexp(𝔤)∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]
 \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g}) \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet]


etc. This is the delooping
τ nexp(𝔤)=BG
  \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g}) = \mathbf{B}G


of the universal Lie integration of 𝔤\mathfrak{g} to an smooth n-group GG.

Definition
For any X∈[CartSp smooth op,sSet]X \in [CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet] and X^→X\hat X \to X any cofibrant resolution in the local projective model structure on simplicial presheaves (see Smooth∞Grpd for details), we say that the sSet-hom object


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤))[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX;


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤) diff)[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff}) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX equipped with pseudo ∞\infty-connection;


[CartSp smooth op,sSet](X^,τ nexp(𝔤) conn)[CartSp_{smooth}^{op}, sSet](\hat X, \tau_n \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn}) is the ∞-groupoid of smooth GG-principal ∞-bundles on XX equipped with ∞\infty-connection.




Remark
In view of this definition we may read the above sequence of morpisms of coefficient objects as follows:
exp(𝔤) conn   genuineconnections ↓ exp(𝔤) ChW   pseudo−connectionwithglobalcurvaturecharacteristics ↓ exp(𝔤) diff   pseudo−connections ↓ ≃ exp(𝔤)   barebundles,
  \array{
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{conn} &&& genuine\;connections
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{ChW} &&& pseudo-connection\;with\;global\;curvature\;characteristics 
    \\
    \downarrow
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} &&& pseudo-connections
    \\
    \downarrow^{\mathrlap{\simeq}}
    \\
    \exp(\mathfrak{g}) &&& bare bundles
  }
  \,,


As we shall see in more detail below, the components of an ∞\infty-connection in terms of the above diagrams we may think of as follows:
Ω •(U×Δ k) vert ←A vert CE(𝔤)   gaugetransformation ↑  ↑ Ω •(U×Δ k) ←A W(𝔤)   𝔤−valuedform ↑  ↑ Ω •(U) ←⟨F A⟩ inv(𝔤)   curvaturecharacteristicforms
    \array{
      \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)_{vert}
      &\stackrel{A_{vert}}{\leftarrow}&
      CE(\mathfrak{g})
      &&&
      gauge\;transformation
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      \Omega^\bullet(U \times \Delta^k)
      &\stackrel{A}{\leftarrow}&
      W(\mathfrak{g})
      &&&
      \mathfrak{g}-valued\;form
      \\
      \uparrow && \uparrow
      \\
      \Omega^\bullet(U)
      &\stackrel{\langle F_A\rangle}{\leftarrow}&
      inv(\mathfrak{g})
      &&&
      curvature\;characteristic\;forms
    }



Remark
In full Chern-Weil theory in Smooth∞Grpd the fundamental object of interest is really exp(𝔤) diff\exp(\mathfrak{g})_{diff} – the object of pseudo-connections, which serves as the correspondence object for an ∞-anafunctor out of exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g}) that presents the differential characteristic classes on exp(𝔤)\exp(\mathfrak{g}). From an abstract point of view the other objects only serve the purpose of picking particularly nice representatives.
This distinction is important: over objects X∈X \in  Smooth∞Grpd that are not smooth manifolds but for instance orbifolds, the genuine 𝔤\mathfrak{g}-connections for general higher 𝔤\mathfrak{g} do not exhaust all nonabelian differential cocycles. This just means that not every differential class in this case does have a nice representative.

Given an adjunction
(L⊣R):X⇄RLY
  (L \dashv R)
  \colon\;
  X
    \underoverset{R}{L}{\rightleftarrows}
  Y


there is a natural transformation (or more generally, a 22-morphism) η:id X→R∘L\eta\colon id_X \to R \circ L, called the unit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “front adjunction”). (A reason for the name is that R∘LR \circ L is a monad, which is a kind of monoid object, and η\eta is the identity of this monoid. Since ‘identity’ in this context would suggest an identity natural transformation, we use the synonym ‘unit’.)
Similarly, there is a 22-morphism ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon\colon L \circ R \to id_Y, called the counit of the adjunction (in older texts, called a “back adjunction” or “end adjunction”). (This is the co-identity of the comonad L∘RL \circ R.)
General
Unit and counit of an adjunction satisfy the triangle identities.
An adjunct is given by precomposition with a unit or postcomposition with a counit.
The left adjoint L:X→YL : X \to Y is fully faithful (i.e. a coreflection) if and only if the unit η:id X→R∘L\eta : id_X \to R \circ L is a natural isomorphism (if and only if id X≅R∘Lid_X \cong R \circ L by Lemma A1.1.1 of the Elephant). Dually, the right adjoint R:Y→XR : Y \to X is fully faithful (i.e. a reflection) if and only if the counit ϵ:L∘R→id Y\epsilon : L \circ R \to id_Y is a natural isomorphism. (See this Prop. at adjoint functor.)
If the unit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lari (“left adjoint right inverse”); whilst RR is termed rali (“right adjoint left inverse”). Dually, if the counit is the identity, LL is sometimes termed lali (“left adjoint left inverse”); whilst RR is termed rari (“right adjoint right inverse”). All four classes of functor are closed under composition, and contain the equivalences.
Relation to monads
Every adjunction (L⊣R)(L \dashv R) gives rise to a monad T≔R∘LT \coloneqq R \circ L. The unit of this monad id→Tid \to T is the unit of the adjunction, id→R∘Lid \to R \circ L.
A discrete space is, in general, an object of a concrete category SpSp of spaces that is free on its own underlying set. More generally, the notion can be applied relative to any forgetful functor.
Note: This page is about the “cohesive” or “topological” notion of discreteness. In 2-category theory the term “discrete object” is also often used for 0-truncated objects. For this usage, see discrete morphism instead.
A discrete space must, in particular, be a free object for the forgetful functor U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp\to Set, i.e. in the image of its left adjoint F:Set→SpF: Set \to Sp. However, this is not sufficient for it to be free on its own underlying set; we must also require that the counit FUX→XF U X\to X be an isomorphism.
Thus, we say that U:Sp→SetU\colon Sp \to Set (or more generally, any functor) has discrete spaces or discrete objects if it has a fully faithful left adjoint. This ensures that the functor
Set→FSp→USet Set \stackrel{F}\to Sp \stackrel{U}\to Set 
is (naturally isomorphic to) the identity functor on Set. This is true, for example, if SpSp is Top, Diff, Loc, etc.
Assuming that UU is faithful (as it is when SpSp is a concrete category), we can characterise a discrete space XX as one such that every function from XX to YY (for YY any space) is a morphism of spaces. (More precisely, this means that every function from U(X)U(X) to U(Y)U(Y) is the image under UU of a morphism from XX to YY.)
The dual notion is a codiscrete object.
A comonad (or cotriple) on a category AA is a comonoid in the monoidal category of endofunctors A→AA \to A. More generally, a comonad in a 2-category EE is a comonoid in the monoidal category E(X,X)E(X,X) for some object X∈KX\in K.
Just as a monad may be defined for any 2-category, EE, as a lax 2-functor from 1\mathbf{1} to EE, so a comonad in EE is an oplax 2-functor from 1→E\mathbf{1} \to E.
See at monad for more.
Coalgebras
A coalgebra over a comonad (or comodule) over a comonad CC on a category AA is an object a∈Aa\in A with a map a→Caa\to C a satisfying dual axioms to those for an algebra over a monad. The category of coalgebras is called its (co-)Eilenberg-Moore category and satisfies a universal property dual to that of the Eilenberg-Moore object for a monad; it can thereby be internalized to any 2-category. The forgetful functor from the category of coalgebras to the category AA is called a comonadic functor. Similarly, a comonad also has a co-Kleisli category.
Comonadic homology and descent
Any comonad on AA induces an augmented simplicial endofunctor of AA consisting of its iterates. If AA is an abelian category and the comonad is additive, then this is the basis of comonadic homology?. Comodules (= coalgebras) over the comonad with underlying endofunctor M R↦M R⊗ RSM_R\mapsto M_R\otimes_R S in RR-ModMod for the extension of rings R↪SR\hookrightarrow S correspond to the descent data for that extension. Gluing of categories from localizations may also be formalized via comonads.
Mixed distributive laws
Distributive laws between a monad and a comonad are so-called mixed distributive laws; a special case has been rediscovered in physics under the name entwining structures (Brzeziński, Majid 1997). Their theory is often studied in the connection with the theory of comonads in the bicategory of rings, modules and morphisms of modules, that is corings. There is a homomorphism of bicategories from a bicategory of entwinings to a bicategory of corings (Škoda 2008), which is an analogue of the 2-functor compcomp (R. Street, Formal theory of monads, JPAA 1972) of strict 2-categories in the case of distributive laws of monads (recall also that a distributive law among monads corresponds to a monad in the 2-category of monads).
